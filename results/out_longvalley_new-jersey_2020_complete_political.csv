""Our goals are twofold,"" Gov. Phil Murphy said when he made the announcement in May. ""To maximize our democracy while minimizing the risk of illness. We want everyone to participate in a safe, fully democratic process.""
Murphy also said that there will be polling places open in every municipality to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to vote and at least 50 percent of the normal locations per county.
Murphy added that voters who have not been able to seamlessly transition to a mail-in process, like those with a disability, will be kept safe when they cast their vote.
""Social distancing protocols will be enforced within these polling locations including the sanitizing of every touch screen, voting machine in between voters,"" he said.
All registered Democratic and Republican voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail ballot while all unaffiliated and inactive voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail application. Those ballots can be sent back by mail or dropped in one of the boxes.
Where To Vote: In-Person
Vote-By-Mail Drop Boxes
Vote-by-Mail Drop Boxes will be installed in five locations across Morris County
for voters to drop their voted VBM in as opposed to mailing it:
Vote-By-Mail Drop Box Locations
1. Morris County Administration & Records Building
10 Court Street, Morristown NJ 07960
(Outside front entrance)
2. Mount Olive Municipal Building
204 Flanders/Drakestown Road, Budd Lake NJ 07828
(Parking Lot entrance to Municipal Offices)
3. Rockaway Twp. Municipal Building
65 Mount Hope Road, Rockaway, NJ 07866
(Outside Police Department)
4. Montville Municipal Building
195 Changebridge Road, Montville, NJ 07045
(In front of Municipal Building)
5. Madison Municipal Building
Hartley Dodge Memorial Building
50 Kings Road, Madison, NJ 07940
(Behind Police Headquarters)
Another key change will be the voting deadline. While all the ballots must still be postmarked by the July 7 election day, Murphy said that the deadline which votes must be received by a county board of elections – to be counted as valid – will be extended from 48 hours after the polls close to seven days after the polls close.
""We expect a greater than normal vote-by-mail turnout the deadline,"" he said. ""And we will ensure that every vote is counted.""

Ramapo College senior and Long Valley native Ben Yaskulka was elected Chairman of the New Jersey College Republicans (NJCR), leading an Executive Board with officers from eight different colleges. NJCR is the Garden State's official college group within the College Republicans National Committee.
""I'm honored to be entrusted with this position,"" said Yaskulka, a political science major and aspiring political leader. ""On many college campuses, conservative voices are rarely heard or advocated for. Young conservative voices are underrepresented at the polls. And people with differing views rarely have constructive dialog. I look forward to helping change all of that.""
He is joined by:
""I also want to express my deepest appreciation for outgoing Chairman Peter Shenouda, the entire outgoing Board, and all of the national officials who have already reached out to me,"" Yaskulka said. ""Most of all, I'm thrilled to work with this outstanding group of fellow officers.""
The New Jersey College Republicans are the extension of the Republican Party on New Jersey's college campuses, promoting principles of the Republican Party among college-aged students in the state.

""We thank Morris County residents for their great effort to deal with the current crisis, from sewing masks and helping to feed unemployed families to social distancing, hand washing, and caring for their family, friends and neighbors,"" said Freeholder Director Deborah Smith. ""Now we have to consider the next step to determine how recovery will occur, how we will get our great country on its feet again.""
The Morris County Board of Freeholders is creating a Morris County COVID-19 Recovery Task Force, to include a group of key leaders from all segments of Morris County life, to help plan for the county's eventual return to normalcy from the COVID-19 crisis.
The Task Force would operate in concert with President Donald J. Trump's three-phase plan to gradually Open Up America Again. https://www.whitehouse.gov/ope...
The Board of Freeholders voted to create a Task Force subcommittee, including Smith, John Krickus and Tom Mastrangelo, to spearhead the effort.
Leaders from government, health, education, labor, social services, and others would be invited to participate in an effort to gather information, share ideas and develop strategies for the post-COVD-19 world in Morris County, in conjunction with state and federal governments. They would consider how to overcome potential obstacles to recovery, officials said.
The Task Force could:
At the same time, Senator Anthony Bucco and the Morris County Chamber of Commerce announced the formation of a COVID Economic Advisory Committee to develop specific recommendations that can have immediate positive impacts on local businesses, married with ways to safely reopen the economy as the State emerges from this crisis.
Bucco will rely on the business-led blueprint in making recommendations to the Murphy administration while offering proactive solutions that can be used as part of the six-state council to restore the economy.
""Too often, leaders in government create policies and economic funding formulas that sound good on paper, but miss the mark because many politicians have no experience running businesses or creating jobs,"" said Bucco. ""We need business leaders of all sizes to have a voice in the simple ways we orderly and safely get people back to work now, while addressing the long-term measures that can get New Jersey back stronger after the pandemic. For example, our lake-based marinas are permitted to be open for personal boating use, but unable to rent boats and generate sales – which could be done safely with occupancy limits. We've already had successes with cutting red-tape for things like craft brewery deliveries and online car sales, and there is still more to do. I'm excited to get to work with the Morris County Chamber.""
The County Chamber is moving quickly to build an Advisory Committee touching on all sectors – from retail to commercial real estate, hospitality, manufacturing, global pharmaceutical companies, service-based businesses, and entertainment venues, officials said.
""Our members are proud to support this effort with Senator Bucco, to provide them a voice in the policy formation that directly impacts their livelihoods and the jobs they represent across Morris County,"" said Meghan Hunscher, President & CEO of the Morris County Chamber. ""Our goal is to quickly develop concrete solutions that help drive decision-making. We are also exploring survey capabilities for all of our members, regardless of whether they serve on the committee, to provide input.""

What that means for residents is the average municipal tax bill, based on the average home value of $436,000, will be increased $22.
This does not take into account county or school taxes.
At the meeting of the governing body on Monday, Mayor Matt Murello said he received some inquiries about the May 1 property tax due date.
""By statute, the municipality can establish a ten-day grace period which we have done. This quarter the due date will be the 11th because the 10th is a Sunday. The state has not authorized a longer extension. There was a bill to do so,"" Murello said. ""This was stopped largely through the efforts of the NJEA because it would have delayed payments to schools and counties until taxes were collected.""

But Washington Township Mayor Matt Murello says he wants to preserve one if he can: graduation.

""Over the weekend, I have had several conversations with Principal Tim Rymer of WMCHS and Chief (Jeffrey) Almer,"" Murello said. ""The HS is committed to having graduation this June and I have promised the Township will offer whatever support the high school needs to make sure that the class of 2020 has a graduation on June 11 at 5 p.m.""
Murello noted that so students have missed out on so much this Spring due to distance learning. Not just the after school activities like sports, clubs and the arts, but the social aspect of school. Murello specifically said no one has felt this more keenly than the West Morris Central Class of 2020, and that helping them get a graduation is a priority.
""I don't know what that's going to look like at this point, but we will make sure that our graduates are given the commencement that they deserve from WMCHS as they start the next chapter of their lives while complying with the Governor's Executive Orders on gatherings and social distancing and keeping everyone safe,"" Murello said.
Murello said that since the beginning of the emergency, he watchedthe community come together like never before.
""People have started online groups to help our medical staff and first responders, offer food and supplies to people that can't get access to them, create PPE for others, shop or deliver groceries to seniors that can't get out and just offer emotional support to our neighbors,"" he said. ""I know that this month has been difficult and we still have some time to go before we can start to get to some level of normalcy. Whatever that new 'normal' may look like. You all have made me very honored to represent you as your Mayor.""

The Washington Township Health Department is encouraging all residents to take simple precautions to protect themselves and others from respiratory illness:
Counting the new cases Thursday, there have been 29 people diagnosed with presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in New Jersey as of Thursday afternoon, with one person dying from the disease. Gov. Phil Murphy has declared a state of emergency, and schools across the state have begun to cancel classes. READ MORE: NJ Coronavirus Updates (Here's What You Need To Know)In general – depending on where they live – New Jersey residents still face a ""low risk"" of contracting COVID-19, State Epidemiologist Christina Tan said during a Wednesday press conference.
There have been more than 1,300 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus as of Thursday morning according to Johns Hopkins University, which said the disease also has killed 38 people nationwide.
WHAT IS COVID-19?
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that include the common cold as well as much more serious diseases. The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21.
The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.
According to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.
To avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.
The CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. You should only wear a mask if a health care professional recommends it. A face mask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms. This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of face masks also is crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).
Residents who have questions about the virus can contact the State of New Jersey's hotline at 1 (800) 222-1222. The hotline is home of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System, and is staffed 24 hours a day by state health workers.

Murello, a few weeks into his second consecutive term in the post, maintains a strong social media presence and addresses everything from award ceremonies, traffic accidents and everything in between. This week, Murello tackled a rumor about the closing of the recycling center.
Murello noted he had been contacted by several people who told him that they had heard
rumors spreading that the town is closing the recycling center in June.
""We received notice that the cost to haul away our recycling, bottle, cans and paper, would increase next year by more than $25,000,"" Murello posted to his Facebook page. ""This increase would exceed the amount that the Township receives in grants to operate this center and the additional cost would need to come from somewhere else in the budget.""
Murello said that the governing body posed the question to the Department of Public Works, Green Team and Environmental Commission if this increase in cost justifies keeping the center open.
""The responses we received back from all three groups were either to reduce operations or close the facility or charge residents a fee for the use,"" Murello said.
Murello said that during the current budgeting process thus far, three open meetings, they received only a budgetary request from the DPW for the additional funds to operate the recycling center for the Committee to consider.
""No final decision has been made by the Committee. If a decision is made to change operations of the recycling center, notice will be made by the Township,"" he said. ""The Committee will make this decision this month and will always try to balance the needs of the residents with the budgetary constraints of our Township.""
Murello noted that this conversation was only regarding the bottles, cans and paper side of the center and that all other areas of the center are not part of this discussion.
""The rumors that the Township was closing the center this June, are just that, rumors, started by someone who is only passively involved with the decision making process, clearly does not pay attention,"" Murello said.""Please know that I always try to balance these issues with cost to provide the services.""

Washington Township Schools Superintendent Jeff Mohre told Patch in an email that a successful vote on Tuesday to limit the costs to $4,174,248 would lead to a $1.67 million grant from the State of New Jersey to help with these projects. Mohre said in the email that the multi-million dollar projects can be done without raising taxes if the measure passes.
Polling is from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday.
The priority projects, Mohre said, would be to install a new HVAC system, an electrical upgrade and a partial roof replacement for the Old Farmers Road School and a partial roof replacement for the Long Valley Middle School.
See a slideshow presentation on the measure.
""This is an excellent opportunity for our Board of Education to continue the timely and quality maintenance of its schools,"" Mohre told Patch.
""What makes this special election extra special is the fact that we strongly anticipate that no new tax dollars will be needed to support the building projects,"" he said.
According to Mohre, if the measure passes, the Board of Education will combine the $1.67 million grant with $2,504,248 in board's Capital Reserve Account to makes its one and only debt payment in July 2021.
""This is why we strongly anticipate a tax impact of $0. The Board, along with its bonding counsel, simply do not foresee the need to raise additional tax monies to complete the four identified priority projects,"" he told Patch.

Murello was chosen for his second consecutive term as mayor. Under the Township form of government there is no direct election of mayor. Under the current township government laws, voters elect, at-large, the township committee comprising three or five members. The elections are partisan and the committee members serve staggered three-year terms. The township committee elects the mayor for a one-year term. The mayor serves as chair of the township committee and has powers vested in the mayor's office by general law.
You can see Murello's complete remarks below.
""I would like to start this morning by thanking my fellow Committeemen for putting their faith in me to serve our community as Mayor for a second year. I would also like to congratulate Committeemen Forsbrey and Oborn. Lastly I would be remiss if I did not thank our township volunteers, Administrator and township employees, as well as the families of the volunteers and of those of us on the Township Committee, especially my wife Kristine and my children Nick and Olivia, as none of us could serve our community without your support and understanding.
I'd also like to recognize and welcome the following distinguished guests for joining us today:
Morris County Freeholders
Also former committeemen Jim Liabraten and Walt Cullen. Washington Township is always grateful for the excellent working relationships we have with our representatives.
As we move into a new year and a new decade, the accomplishments we have made in the Township are impossible to not recognize. It's important to note however, that our accomplishments could not have been achieved without the hard work of the Township Administrator and my fellow Committeemen. We work collaboratively to benefit the people of the township. Recently an independent group that researches communities nationwide determined again that Washington Township is one of the best communities to live in giving it an ""A"" rating.
Over the last year, we have increased our shared service agreements to include Courts with Mendham Borough in addition to extending our court and police agreements with Califon Borough. Today we will also have a resolution for a new shared services agreement with Washington Borough for animal control services. In total, the Township has 25 shared service agreements. Though in some cases we receive services from another municipality, in most cases Washington Township provides services benefiting the recipients and increasing revenue to our budget. In 2019, we received about $900,000 in shared service revenue, an increase of almost $200,000 from the previous year. Money that goes directly to serve the people of the Township.
Washington Township also continues to benefit from grants. There was over $350,000 in grants in the 2019 budget that included about $200,000 for Naughright Road work, between Bartley Road and Fairview and about $80,000 for a new trail in Harrington Park which will be completed in 2020. On average, the Township applies for and receives $350,000 in grants annually. However, we have already been awarded two grants at the end of 2019 and the start of 2020 totaling over $500,000 for more work on Naughright Road, which will be included in the upcoming budget.
Over the last year, I have listened to residents about the quality of our infrastructure. We have about 140 miles of roads and we work with the County and our DPW every year to prioritize the roads in greatest need of repair. In 2019, we continued to work on improving our infrastructure by budgeting more than $900,000 on paving and resurfacing projects, an increase of more than $500,000 annually from 6 years ago. The Committee also appropriated more than $100,000 for replacing and improving the exterior of the Municipal Building. Though the municipal building is only subject to capital review by the Planning Board, the Township asked the Historic Preservation Commission for its input, then submitted its plans to them for a certificate of appropriateness, just as a homeowner in the historic district would. That plan continues to progress and I hope will result in a completed project this year.
Our recreation department continues to deliver almost daily programs for our families and seniors in town. Including; movies under the stars, sports and fitness programs and senior holiday lunches. But having diverse programs isn't enough and we will continue to maintain and improve our recreation facilities and fields which are some of the best around. We have also continued to improve our parks and open spaces in town. In 2019 we installed the more than 1½ miles of walking paths at Rock Spring Park and, as I previously mentioned, we will be adding additional walking trails at Harrington Park this year.
Washington Township has the best emergency service departments. Our all-volunteer fire departments and first aid squad are the best trained, and hardest working volunteer force in the area and the envy of our neighboring towns. We continued to support our departments in 2019 by working with them to deliver a new fire truck and a new ambulance, as well as to reserve over $600,000 for emergency equipment and vehicles over the last two years. This is due in large part to the Township Committee and emergency services working together to obtain grant funding and develop, and stick to, five-year capital replacement plans. While we all hope to never need the services of our emergency departments, we are thankful when they respond when we do and we will remain committed to keeping them equipped.
Our Township police department remains one of the top municipal forces in the State. In 2019 the Department received accreditation by the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police. A process that took two years and over 2,000 hours to complete. The Department's community-oriented approach to policing included events like Coffee with a Cop, School Resource Officers, and open forums on public safety, opioids, vaping, and violence with the goal of keeping our Township safe and maintaining our excellent quality of life. We recently swore in three new officers to the department and, with upcoming retirements, we anticipate promotions.
While continuing to improve our town, deliver the services and equipment needed, the Committee hears the residents about property taxes and remains fiscally conservative with municipal budget. Washington Township has the second lowest percentage municipal tax rate in Morris County. Statewide, the average share of property taxes that went to municipalities was about 30%, while about 50% went to schools and 20% to counties. In 2019, 18% of property taxes went to the municipality and 72% to schools in Washington Township.
In the 2019 budget, the municipal share of the tax increase was roughly 1.5%. Over the last 5 years, the Municipal tax increase has been less than 2% annually. In addition, we have not in that time used any exceptions to the 2% cap allowed by the state. Furthermore, the Committee in 2019 used the lowest percent of surplus funds in the last five years, allowing the Township to pay down our debit and increase our surplus more rapidly and responsibly. As we begin to work on the budget for this year, a process that is open to the public, the Committee will continue this trend to keep the municipal share of the property taxes low and deliver the services needed for our residents.
Looking ahead into 2020, the Township is participating in the county's five-year hazard mitigation plan update. Once complete, the Township will be seeking grant funding for hazards identified in the plan, like the emerald ash borer. We will continue to work on public education with the Shade Tree Commission and acquisition of equipment to enhance removal of ash trees subject to the infestation. I have also begun review of our ordinances so the Committee can reduce the red tape for home owners looking to improve their property. We want our departments and Boards to have a culture of working with homeowners and small businesses. Finally, I have also requested the power company to do a comprehensive review of the Township's tree trimming program and aging power infrastructure in order to take a proactive approach to mitigating future large-scale power outages.
Washington Township is a great place to live and we are going to keep it that way. I want to conclude by again thanking the Committee, Township Administrator and all of the employees and volunteers for a great 2019 and for an optimistic new year.""

17,/new-jersey/longvalley/buccos-replacement-set-be-picked-week,2019-11-19T15:06:59Z,Bucco's Replacement Set To Be Picked This Week,0,1,Katie Kausch ,Patch Staff,"MENDHAM, NJ — Morris County Republicans will gather this week to select now-Sen. Anthony M. Bucco's replacement in the Assembly.
The convention will be held this Thursday at the County College of Morris, in Randolph. Because space is limited, only committee embers from the 25th district, candidates for the seat, elected officials from the district, or people with a entrance pass will be permitted to attend.
Six Republicans are vying to be appointed to the Assembly in the 25th District (read more about them below). That person will hold the seat until a special election can be held in Nov. 2020. They will join Assemblyman-elect Brian Bergen in Trenton.
The race for Assembly in the 25th District was an unusual one this year. Sen. Anthony M. Bucco vacated his Assembly seat in October when he was appointed to the Senate to fill the seat previously held by his late father. That put him in the position of running for an Assembly seat he did not intend to fill.
Had Bucco lost the election, Republicans still would have needed to select a replacement; they would have then served until the Assemblyperson-elect was sworn into office in January 2020.
John Barbarula, Randolph: Barbarula is a lawyer and business owner who has lived in the district for 25 years. Read more about him here.
Alison Deeb, Morristown: Deeb served as a councilwoman in Morristown for 12 years, and has over 25 years of private sector experience. Read more about her here.
Aura Dunn, Mendham Borough: Dunn has worked as a policy advisor and budget analyst for committees on the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, and has extensive volunteer experience. Read more about her here.
Sarah Neibart, Mendham Township: Neibart is the current deputy mayor of Mendham Township, and previously worked in several high-profile Republican campaigns. Read more about her here.
Bob Olejar, Randolph: Olejar is a lawyer and forensic accountant, and has worked as an assistant prosecutor in Bergen County. Read more about him here.
Al Ribeiro, Bernardsville: Ribeiro works in the biopharmaceutical center in cancer treatment, and has worked on Republican campaigns across the country. Read more about him here."

Bucco has been elected to the Assembly, alongside running mate Denville Councilman Brian Bergen.
Bucco and Bergen were elected with 27,438 and 26,134 votes, respectively. Democratic challengers Lisa Bhimani and Darcy Draeger received 24,381 and 23,702 votes each. The results come over a week after polls closed on Election Day, as the race remained too close to call without counting provisional and mail-in ballots.
This creates a highly unusual situation for Republicans: Bucco was appointed to his late father's senate seat in mid-October, and has already said he will not be accepting the seat in the Assembly. It's now up to the Morris County Republican Committee to select and appointment a new Assembly representative in New Jersey's 25th district. The Committee has not responded to questions from Patch about who they are looking to appoint.
It also would have been unprecedented had Bhimani and Draeger been elected. No Democrat has ever been elected to represent New Jersey's 25th District in the Assembly since the district was created in 1974.
The appointed representative to Bucco's Assembly seat will serve until a special election can be held for the seat in November 2020.
Current Assemblyman Michel Patrick Carroll did not seek reelection this year, choosing instead to run for Morris County Surrogate. He lost in the primary to fellow Republican Heather Darling.
Bucco faced criticism during the campaign from Democrats for running for a seat he knew he would not accept.
The Democratic campaign have not yet issued statements on the results of the election."

Bucco and Denville Councilman Brian Bergen and Democrat ticket Lisa Bhimani and Darcy Draeger remains too close to call.
Bucco and Bergen have a slight lead in the unofficial results. As of 11:50 p.m., 169 out of 169 districts in Morris County are reporting, and the single Somerset County district reporting:
Although all districts are reporting results, the race remains too close to call. Unofficial vote totals do not include provisional or mail-in ballots; no candidate has issued a concession statement as of 11:51 p.m. A spokesperson for Bhimani and Draeger did not respond to Patch's request for comment.
Should Bhimani and Draeger win, it will be the first time a Democrat has ever been elected to represent New Jersey's 25th District in the Assembly since the district was created in 1974.
It would also be the first time two women have represented the district together. Republican Jane Burgio represented the district between 1974 and 1981, alongside Thomas Kean at first, and then Frederic Remington.
Should Bucco and Bergen be elected, things will be slightly more complicated. Bucco was the incumbent candidate until mid-October, when he vacated his assembly seat to be appointed to his late father's former Senate seat following the elder Bucco's death. If Bucco wins, the Morris County Republican Committee will appoint someone to hold his seat until a special election can be held in November 2020.
Should Bucco lose, a special appointment will only hold the seat until January 20, when one of the Democrats are sworn in."

Murphy Blasts Mitch McConnell For 'Rank...,0,0,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - After a warm remembrance of presenting an award to the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg in the halls of the United States Supreme Court, Governor Phil Murphy took aim at Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over his plans to replace her.
""The rank hypocrisy of those like Senator Mitch McConnell is showing,"" Murphy said at Monday's COVID-19 briefing. ""They want to ram a nominee through six weeks before a presidential election when, just four years ago, they refused to offer even a hearing to a nominee whose name was put forward eight months before an election.""
Murphy, who has gone after McConnell repeatedly for his lack of movement on a second coronavirus aid package, pulled no punches when it came to McConnell and his party brethren.
""How many Republicans will have the guts to stand up and demand that the process be put on hold until after the nation chooses its next president?"" Murphy said. ""That's really a rhetorical question, as so few have shown any guts over the past four years.""
Murphy said that the move for Republicans isn't about the nation's future.
""It's a blatant power grab by those whose mission is to undo decades of civil rights progress, protect polluters over the environment, gut health care, and deny a woman the right to make her own reproductive decisions,"" he said.
Of Ginsberg, Murphy noted that when he ""had the distinct honor"" of presenting her with the Golden Pea award from the German organization MARCHENLAND Berlin last year she took time after the ceremony to tour the Supreme Court with the visitors and educate them on the paintings of all the justices.
""Tammy Murphy and I will never forget that day,"" he said. ""May her memory be a blessing.""

In August, Governor Phil Murphy made the decision, which was then backed by legislative action, to make the upcoming Nov. 3 primarily vote-by-mail. Voters will have several options when it comes to getting their ballot in. They can mail it back, drop it off at a polling location on election day or use one of the new drop boxes.
The boxes are all outside and under surveillance 24/7. They resemble a USPS Blue Mailbox, but are Red, White & Blue and display ""Morris County – Official Ballot Drop Box.""
While there won't be one in Long Valley, there are two close by. One will be at the Chester Township Municipal Building at 1 Parker Road. The box will be in the parking lot by Clothing Drop box. Another will be at the Mount Olive Municipal Building at 204 Flanders/Drakestown Road. The box will be by the parking lot entrance to Municipal Offices.
The Vote-By-Mail ballots (VBMs) will be picked up on a daily basis and brought to the Board of Elections. All security measures will be followed when collecting and transporting the VBMs, officials said.

""As the pandemic continues to threaten our public health, we have made adjustments to the upcoming election to provide every New Jersey voter the opportunity to safely cast their vote,"" said Murphy. ""With today's education campaign launch, we are ensuring that New Jerseyans are aware of every voting option and additional resources that are available for this year's General Election.""
Starting this week, the NEW JERSEY VOTES education campaign, which includes multi-media promotion and a new Vote.NJ.Gov website, will help answer questions about registering to vote, voting by mail, tracking ballots, finding secure ballot drop boxes, voting in-person and more.
The education campaign is especially designed to help voters understand the vote by mail process, which was decreed through an executive order and signed into law by Governor Phil Murphy for the safety of the state's voters in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
According to Way, voters can feel confident that the election process will be safe, simple, and secure.
""We're launching the New Jersey Votes education campaign to ensure every New Jerseyan feels comfortable and well informed about the voting process,"" said Way. ""For 2020, all active registered voters in New Jersey will automatically receive their ballots in the mail. Then it's as easy as vote, sign, seal, return. How you return it is up to you—at the post office, in a secure ballot drop box, at your county Board of Elections office, or at your polling place.""
The NEW JERSEY VOTES education campaign will be in multiple languages through advertisements in print and digital outlets, billboards, and collateral materials, as well as through TV and radio commercials airing throughout the state. The state government's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts will regularly share posts highlighting how to vote by mail.
Among the information being shared in the education campaign are key deadlines for the voting process. By Oct. 5, New Jersey's County Clerks must send a Vote By Mail Ballot to all registered active voters.
""Once you have received your ballot, if you know how you are voting, there is no need to wait,"" said Way. ""We're making it very easy and encouraging everyone to vote by mail as soon as they receive their ballot rather than having to wait until Election Day itself. However, if you prefer to drop off your ballot in a secure local drop box or in-person, you can certainly do so.""
Voters should read the instructions on their ballot carefully, and then vote. Here is how:
""By staying home and voting by mail, we can participate in our democracy while doing our part to keep our fellow voters and our election workers safe on Nov. 3,"" said Murphy.
The deadline to register to vote for this general election is Oct. 13. New Jersey now offers online registration at https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/voter-registration.shtml. Those unsure of their registration status can check at https://voter.svrs.nj.gov/registration-check.
If voters need assistance or have any questions, their local, county, and state election officials are available to help. Voters can reach out to their County Clerk, County Board of Elections, County Superintendent of Elections, or call the state voter information/protection hotline at 1-877-NJVOTER (1-877-658- 6837).

Warren County Clerk Holly Mackey explained to Patch the difference between and absentee ballot vs. this year's vote-by-mail option. Traditionally an absentee ballot to be submitted via mail would need to be requested.

24,/new-jersey/longvalley/how-are-election-signature-verified-nj-patch-found-out,2020-08-31T13:00:00Z,How Are Election Signatures Verified In NJ?...,0,0,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - Since Governor Phil Murphy made the decision that this year's Nov. 3 election is going to be primarily vote-by-mail, there has been a flurry of inquiries into how the process works.
In order to allay some of those fears, Patch has been speaking with election officials on various topics, including Warren County Clerk Holly Mackey, on how the signature verification process works.
Explanation of the Signature Verification Process for Mail-In Ballots in Warren County (each county may be slightly different):
The ballot package you will be receiving in the mail will contain, at minimum: Your ballot, the certification envelope, the return envelope (this is postage paid and will have your name and a barcode printed on it, however your party affiliation will not appear) and an instruction sheet.
Once you vote your ballot, you will place it in the certification envelope (CE) and seal it. The CE will have a detachable flap where you will print and sign your name. Do not detach the flap. You then place your CE inside the return envelope and return it to us via the USPS, in person to our office or election board office, in one of the 11 drop boxes located throughout the county or in person at your polling location on Election Day.
""When we receive your ballot we use the pre-printed barcode to scan it into the Statewide Voter Registration System (SVRS),"" Mackey said. ""Only one ballot can be received for each registered voter. If a voter returns two ballots for any reason, the system issues an alert when the second ballot is scanned and does not allow the process to go any further. The second ballot is rejected. This is one protection against duplicate voting.""
Once your outer ballot envelope is scanned, it will be opened and your certification envelope will be removed. Your signature will be manually compared to the one we have on record in the SVRS. If it matches, the flap is detached and your sealed ballot becomes anonymous and is placed in your municipality's bin along with all the other returned anonymous envelopes.
""We can start opening them at 12:01 am Election Day. If your signature does not match the SVRS system on first pass, it will be given to the supervising Election Commissioners to review,"" she said. ""If they agree with the mismatch they pass it to the administrative staff at the Election Board for final say. If all three agree that it doesn't match, the Board of Elections will mail you a 'cure letter.'""
According to Mackey, if you fill out and return the cure letter within the allotted timeframe, your ballot will be counted.
""If you do not return the letter, your ballot will be rejected,"" she said, noting each county's procedure could vary slightly.

25,/new-jersey/longvalley/what-provisional-ballot-patch-found-out-new-jersey,2020-08-27T14:00:00Z,What's A NJ Provisional Ballot? How Does It...,0,15,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - Ever since Governor Phil Murphy announced that the November election would be primarily vote-by-mail, there has been a flurry of concern about the voting in person which will be done by using a provisional ballot.
According to Warren County Clerk Holly Mackey, in every election paper provisional ballots are supplied to the poll workers and are nothing new.
""They are commonly used for things such as a voter appearing in person but does not show up in the poll books, for a whole host of reasons, and for people who were issued a vote-by-mail ballot,"" Mackey said. ""They are given the paper provisional ballot and the affirmation statement that they fill out.""
Mackey said that after the election each provisional ballot cast is investigated by the Board of Elections and if the voter's registration is deemed valid, or the voter did not return a ballot in the mail, which would be voting twice, the provisional ballot is accepted.
Mackey noted that each county is responsible for their own ballot design, but in Warren County:
""The Executive order allows voters to return their mail-in ballots to their polling place on Election Day, this is new this election, and hand them to a poll worker,"" Mackey said. "" These ballots are counted starting the day after the election, Nov. 4.""

26,/new-jersey/longvalley/no-your-party-affiliation-not-your-nj-ballot-clerk,2020-08-25T14:00:00Z,"No, Your Party Affiliation Is Not On Your NJ...",2,23,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"MORRIS COUNTY, NJ - The vote-by-mail decision for the general election made by Gov. Phil Murphy has prompted lawsuits, social media misinformation and it has prompted Morris County Clerk to set the record straight.
Particularly when it comes to party affiliation on the ballot.
""We have been fielding a multitude of questions concerning a notation on primary election envelopes where the voter's party identification appeared,"" Grossi said. ""This will not happen in the general election because all registered voters are eligible to vote.""
Grossi said the primary election in New Jersey is partisan, where only registered Democrats and Republicans are eligible to vote. In the general election, everyone can vote.
""The voters' party affiliation and address information is automatically generated by the state Voter Registration System and that information is printed on the envelope,"" she said. ""During the Primary Election, the party affiliation is printed on the envelope for no other purpose than to ensure that the correct ballot is inserted into the correct voter's envelope in preparation for mailing.""
The notation as to party affiliation is also required during the primary election for sorting purposes to expedite correct counting of ballots by the accepting election agency, Grossi noted.
Grossi also answered some questions Patch had about other elections misconceptions.
If you mean by ""buckshot"" that we send the entire batch out at one time, the answer is no. We send them to the post office on a daily basis. Another word, as we complete a day's work, that completed work will be sent the following day to the post office.
We rely on the accuracy of the State Voter Registration System (""SVRS"") concerning eligible voters. The Board of Elections, which is a separate agency from the Clerk's Office, is responsible for the upkeep, maintenance and accuracy of registration information contained in the SVRS.
They should notify the Board of Elections, who is responsible for updating the SVRS and for curing those deficiencies.
When a vote by mail ballot is sent to a voter, that information is entered into the SVRS. When the voter returns the ballot to the Board of Elections, receipt of the voter's ballot is entered into the SVRS. At that point, the SVRS will not permit another vote by mail ballot to be issued to that voter. Upon the request of a voter, a duplicate ballot may be issued only if the original ballot has not been received and entered into SVRS. The ballot is marked as a duplicate and is only counted after the Board of Elections verifies that the original ballot was not received.
The Board of Election verifies every VBM ballot, not the vote itself, based upon the information that is contained on the outside envelope. Once the certification is detached from the envelope, the secrecy of the vote is maintained. The ballot is then machine counted on Election Day.

27,/new-jersey/longvalley/freeholder-title-abolished-new-jersey,2020-08-21T19:14:03Z,'Freeholder' Title Abolished In New Jersey,0,3,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - There is going to be a run on stationary, as the Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation Friday which requires the title of ""chosen freeholder"" to be changed to ""county commissioner"" and all ""boards of chosen freeholders"" to be known as ""boards of county commissioners.""
""We have an obligation to ensure that governance in New Jersey is inclusive and representative of the tremendous diversity of our great state,"" said Murphy. ""Amid a national reckoning to reexamine vestiges rooted in structural racism, this action will eliminate the use of the term 'Freeholder' in county government— a title that is an outgrowth of a time when people of color and women were excluded from public office.""
""Changing the title of 'Freeholder' is long overdue. People know the term is offensive and refers to a time when only white male landowners could hold public office,"" said Lt. Governor Sheila Oliver, who serves as Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. ""As a former Freeholder, I was fully aware that this title was not inclusive of African American woman such as myself. History is constantly evolving, and our terminology needs to keep up with it to be more reflective of where we are as a society.""
The bill also requires counties to update their letterheads, stationary, and other writings, as well as their websites, to bear the title of county commissioners in place of freeholders or chosen freeholders within one year of the bill's effective date, Jan. 1, 2021.
""Proudly, New Jersey is no longer the only state with this title,"" said Union County Freeholder Angela R. Garretson. ""Although we may be the last state to end this vile categorization of county officeholders, we are the first to pass legislation and sign it into law, with overwhelming bipartisan support from State leaders with integrity and vision. I am also happy, so many county level officials joined the movement to update and embrace the universally understood and inclusive title of county commissioner.""
The bill would not require counties to update or replace signs or other writings to reflect this title change within this timeframe if doing so would require the expenditure of county funds. In these cases, the title would be changed whenever the writing is next updated or replaced in the ordinary course of business.
""As a former freeholder, I believe it is important that the public knows the substance of what a freeholder does rather than what the term freeholder is,"" said Senator Joe Pennacchio. ""Today's action was nine years in the making from when I initially proposed the abolishment of the antiquated term. The title 'county commissioner' will lend itself to transparency. This revamp will ensure more Garden State residents better understanding the function of this important position in county government.""
Senate President Steve Sweeney said the public job title of ""freeholder"" perpetuates a legacy of bigotry that disenfranchised groups of Americans and denied them full rights and equal opportunities.
""We should be diligent in erasing all remnants of oppression that are unjust and divisive,"" he said.

Conspicuously absent from the endorsement list was Republican U.S. Senate Candidate Rikin Mehta. Mehta is facing a battle on multiple fronts in his race against Cory Booker. Mehta had won a close primary election against Hirsh Singh which is being recounted.
PBA officials did not elaborate on why they did not endorse Mehta.
Their list of endorsements:

United States Senate
United States House of Representatives
New Jersey Senate (special election)
New Jersey General Assembly (special election)
In 2018, the NJ PBA backed Leonard Lance over Tom Malinowski and Tom MacArthur over Andy Kim. The group also endorsed Mikie Sherrill in the 11th district in 2018 but are now supporting her challenger, Becchi.
""Police officers are our neighbors and friends who have dedicated their lives to protecting our communities,"" Becchi said in a statement. ""I am honored to be endorsed by the NJ State PBA. Their courage and sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.""

29,/new-jersey/longvalley/disturbed-sherrill-vote-legislation-save-usps,2020-08-18T16:59:38Z,'Disturbed' Sherrill To Vote On Legislation To ...,0,4,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"PARSIPPANY, NJ - When Morristown Committeeman Mark Gyrofy shared photos on Twitter of mailboxes being taken off the street and placed on a truck on Saturday, it caught the attention of U.S. Representative Mikie Sherrill, who will be returning to Washington to take up the issue of the United States Postal Service.
""The House will be returning to vote this week on legislation to save the USPS and has called the Postmaster General to testify about his recent policies, including removing sorting machines across the country, which undermine the ability of the post office to do its job and serve the American people,"" she said. ""The Senate, which is in recess, should return to session and do the same.""
Not long after Gyrok's post, Morristown Mayor Tim Dougherty clarified to the Daily Record that the large blue boxes weren't being permanently removed, but replaced with new anti-fishing boxes. These look almost identical to the old mailboxes, but are built to prevent contents from being removed illegally through the slot using string and other tools.
But Sherrill noted the concerns are for more than the one incident.
""I'm deeply disturbed by reports around the country and here in the 11th District about slowdowns at the U.S. Postal Service,"" she said. ""Americans depend on the USPS, and the Postmaster General's recent policies are placing an undue burden on our citizens: veterans are waiting weeks for prescriptions to be delivered, people are seeing their credit scores drop because payments sent through the mail are delivered late, and small businesses already reeling from the pandemic are unable to reach their customers or receive materials as they normally would.""
And she isn't the only legislator concerned. The U.S. Postal Service has warned New Jersey officials that mail-in ballots may not be processed in time for the November election, prompting a political firestorm over the mail-in process and concerns from both parties over threats to the election's legitimacy.
The Postal Service warned New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way of the delay in a July 30 letter. At least one New Jersey politician has filed a criminal referral, while others have expressed their outrage about the state of the USPS.
Congressman Bill Pascrell, Jr. wants President Donald Trump and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy investigated, and, frankly, he doesn't care who does it.
Pascrell sent a letter to Postal Service Inspector General Tammy L. Whitcomb seeking an investigation into recent institutional changes. Then on Friday, Pascrell sent a letter to New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal urging an investigation into what he calls interference in New Jersey elections.
""I call upon you to open a wide-ranging investigation of Trump's actions to interfere in our elections and to empanel a grand jury for the purpose of considering criminal indictments for Donald Trump, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, members of the United States Postal Service (USPS) Board of Governors, and any other officials in the Trump government that are participating in or have participated in the subversion of New Jersey state elections,"" he wrote.
Other area politicians have joined in to support the USPS and criticize Trump's efforts to undermine elections.
Congressman Chris Smith says he has repeatedly pushed for ""much-needed relief"" to stabilize the USPS, especially because of the role it will play in November's election.
""A critical aspect of securing our elections is ensuring our Nation has a robust and healthy United States Postal Service,"" Smith said in a statement. ""In the current time of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, our economy and elections are even more reliant upon a strongly supported USPS.""
Smith also said county clerks, county governing bodies and the USPS have expressed concerns about voting by mail.
Congressman Josh Gottheimer will visit the Paramus Post Office at 1 p.m. on Tuesday prior to returning to Washington D.C. as a vote is scheduled ""to safeguard the U.S. Postal Service and ensure the timely delivery of mail, medication, and voting materials,"" according to his office.
""The USPS is vital to everything we do as Americans and is critical in delivering everything from medications to social security checks to mail-in ballots for people here in #NJ5. We must do everything in our power to protect it,"" Gottheimer said on Facebook.
President Trump said so himself last week, admitting that he opposed additional funding to assist the USPS because it would allow states to employ widespread vote-by-mail balloting , Camden County Freeholder Melinda Kane noted.
""Let's be clear: voting by mail is a safe and reliable way to cast your ballot, and the USPS should not be subject to political attacks,"" she said.
Governor Phil Murphy announced Friday that New Jersey's election will be mostly mail-in, with everybody getting a ballot that they can send through the USPS.
If you do vote in person, you will have to do ""what we call provisional voting because the folks won't necessarily know at the voting location whether or not you have already mailed a ballot in.""
According to a representative from the USPS, box removal is done on an annual basis after a review of ""collection box density."" This review seeks out ""redundant"" or ""seldom used"" collection boxes.
After vocal concern from officials and local residents, however, the removal of mailboxes has been put on hold.
""This process is one of the many ways the Postal Service makes adjustments to our infrastructure to match our resources to declining mail volumes. Given the recent customer concerns the Postal Service will postpone removing boxes for a period of 90 days while we evaluate our customers' concerns,"" said spokesman Ray V. Daiutolo Sr.
Sherrill also noted that USPS announced over the weekend that it will suspend the removal of all mailboxes for 90 days and that all mailboxes removed in Morristown will be replaced with anti-theft boxes.
""My office is in contact with our regional USPS district office. We will continue to keep residents informed and get updated information on timetables to ensure this doesn't unduly burden residents,"" she said.
All this comes after a recent interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo, in which Trump said he would block $25 billion in funds for the Postal Service, and would also block another $3.6 billion in additional election funding, according to the Washington Post.
""They need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" Trump said in the phone interview. ""Now, in the meantime, they aren't getting there. By the way, those are just two items. But if they don't get those two items, that means you can't have universal mail-in voting, because they're not equipped.""

The group analyzes elections and campaigns for the US House of Representatives, US Senate, Governors and President as well as American political trends.
In the 2nd District, challenger Amy Kennedy's race was upgraded from ""Lean R"" to ""Toss Up"" in the new ratings, while 11th District U.S. Representative Mikie Sherrill's election was changed from ""Likely D"" to ""Solid D."" Both rating changes reflect the strengths of the Kennedy and Sherrill campaigns, which both feature dynamic female candidates who have forged strong connections with their districts, as well as the continued growth of the Democratic Party's advantages across the state that have accelerated during Governor Phil Murphy's term in office, according to the New Jersey State Democratic Committee.
""Our entire party is working around the clock to help both Amy Kennedy and Mikie Sherrill be victorious this November along with Senator Booker, frontline Democratic candidates like Andy Kim, Tom Malinowski and Stephanie Schmid, the rest of our outstanding Congressional delegation and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot,"" said NJDSC Chairman John Currie. ""It's clear that the work we have done to build our party in recent years under the leadership of Governor Murphy is paying off, with Democrats now holding a 1 million voter registration advantage over Republicans and our party continuing to push into new territory. We will continue working to expand our base and collaborate with exceptional candidates like Amy Kennedy, Mikie Sherrill and our entire 2020 Democratic ticket.""

31,/new-jersey/longvalley/trumps-unemployment-aid-plan-needs-nj-governor-support-senator,2020-08-13T14:30:00Z,Trump's Unemployment Aid Plan Needs NJ Governor...,0,1,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - President Donald Trump signed an executive order Saturday that would provide an extra $400 more than basic unemployment benefits, replacing the $600 federal contribution that expired on July 31.
But individual states would have to pick up $100 of that per person.
""The President's proposal for additional unemployment would actually cost New Jersey an estimated $1.725 billion – and that's just in potential benefits, not even the cost of setting up a system we don't even have,"" Murphy said.
Senator Joseph Pennacchio said politics should not interfere with additional federal aid for unemployed residents, a plan Murphy has called the plan ""unworkable.""
""Like Cuomo in New York and other Democrat governors, Murphy criticized this solution,"" said Pennacchio. ""He wants federal money to go to the state so he can spend it at will. That's the wrong priority when so many New Jersey residents remain out of work through no fault of their own. Once again, he is prioritizing partisanship and politics over the people of our state.""
The President has said states that haven't used all the federal stimulus money they received from the CARES Act could use that money for the $100 payments. Murphy has been sitting on more than $2 billion in federal funds, Pennachio said.
""As the Governor of our state, he should be doing everything in his power to make this happen, not thumbing his nose and politicizing federal assistance,"" said Pennacchio.
A pair of Pennacchio's Democratic Party peers in the state Assembly disagreed. Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin of the 29th District, who represents Belleville and Newark, said she's ""grateful"" for Wednesday's ruling.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a devastating impact on the state's economy,"" Pintor Marin said. ""Residents, businesses, and government units have all been impacted.""
""The Bond Act provides an important solution that, along with significant cuts in spending that must be identified, will help stabilize the state budget,"" Pintor Marin contended. ""We did not make this decision to authorize this borrowing lightly. The historic nature of the current pandemic has led to this unprecedented last resort due to the current fiscal crisis.""
Assemblyman John McKeon of the 27th District, a sponsor of the act, also applauded the Supreme Court's decision.
""The Supreme Court's holding on the act's constitutionality is consistent with the arguments advanced on the floor of the Legislature by advocates,"" said McKeon, who represents towns including Caldwell, Essex Fells, Livingston, Maplewood, Millburn, Roseland, South Orange and West Orange.
""The Supreme Court focused on the language in the Constitution so crafted by the framers for the type of fiscal emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic.""
""The opinion is well-reasoned and a victory for all New Jersey residents whom would otherwise had suffered dire consequences without this legislation,"" McKeon said.
At his Monday COVID-19 briefing, Murphy addressed calls to use the CARES Act money, noting that is was not infinite. And that more was needed from the federal government.
""We need Congress to act. We need Mitch McConnell to finally get something done, and we need him to do it now,"" Murphy said. ""As we battle this pandemic, and look to our recovery, we must be prepared and have every tool in our toolbox at our disposal to protect our state and to keep it a great place to live, to work, and to raise a family.
For his part, Pennacchio said he wants to see ""some"" of the unspent CARES money used.
""One way or the other, almost 700,000 New Jersey families are counting on help,"" he said.

""With record unemployment and an economy destroyed by the pandemic, too many people are staying awake at night worrying about how they are going to pay their bills and put food on the table,"" said Becchi. ""This election might be the most important election of our lifetime and I believe the voters deserve to hear directly from the candidates on what they plan to do to responsibly reopen and get Jersey back to work.""
Becchi said te debates should give both candidates the opportunity to share their platforms, expand on their stance on issues, and describe their vision for the future. They should cover a variety of topics, be spread out across the district, and provide an opportunity for voters to ask questions. The debates should be moderated by third parties without a political agenda or platform, Becchi said.
Becchi said she has been talking to voters throughout the district who are tired of politics and just want to know where the candidates stand on the issues. They want elected officials who will put people ahead of politics.
Becchi, a tax policy attorney and the public advocate behind nonprofit Jersey First, previously had plans to challenge incumbent Democrat Tom Malinowski in the 7th District. However, Becchi said she decided to step up to the plate when national, state and local Republican leaders asked her to consider a run in the 11th District instead.
For her part, Sherrill picked up the endorsement of former President Barack Obama last week.
Obama put out his most recent list of endorsements for 2020 stare elections on Monday, which also included Rep. Josh Gottheimer in the Fifth, Amy Kennedy in the Second, Andy Kim in the Third and Tom Malinowski in the Seventh.
""Barack Obama just endorsed our campaign for #NJ11!"" Sherrill said on social media. ""I'm honored to have his support as we continue our fight for New Jersey families.""
The district includes the following municipalities:
Morris County - Boonton Town, Boonton Township, Butler, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Denville, East Hanover, Florham Park, Hanover, Harding, Jefferson, Kinnelon, Lincoln Park, Madison, Mendham Borough, Mendham Township, Montville, Morris Plains, Morris Township, Morristown Town, Mountain Lakes, Parsippany-Troy Hills, Pequannock, Randolph, Riverdale, Rockaway Borough, Rockaway Township and Victory Gardens
Essex County - Bloomfield (split with 10th), Caldwell, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Fairfield, Livingston, Montclair (split with 10th), North Caldwell, Nutley, Roseland, Verona, West Caldwell, West Orange (split with 10th)
Passaic County - Bloomingdale, Little Falls, North Haledon, Pompton Lakes, Totowa, Wanaque, Wayne and Woodland Park
Sussex County - Byram, Hopatcong, Ogdensburg, Sparta and Stanhope
Becchi said she hopes that Sherrill responds quickly to the request.

33,/new-jersey/longvalley/presidents-order-pandemic-relief-means-nothing-nj-gov,2020-08-10T19:47:25Z,President's Order For Pandemic Relief 'Means...,2,210,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - President Donald Trump on Saturday signed a series of executive orders intended to ease the ongoing economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Governor Phil Murphy was not impressed.
""A payroll tax holiday means nothing to the unemployed, when there is no paycheck coming in. A fact made worse when the $600 enhanced weekly unemployment benefit expired at the end of July,"" Murphy said at his Monday COVID-19 briefing in Trenton. ""Unfortunately a payroll tax holiday will not save workers anything in the long run as they will still be on the hook for the taxes owed, come April 15.""
Murphy noted that a payroll tax holiday diverts billions of dollars from social security and Medicare.
""The former, is a lifeline for millions of American seniors, and the latter is the sole means of healthcare for many others who are wary of becoming COVID-19's next victims,"" he said.
Trump moved to extend supplemental federal unemployment benefits for millions of Americans out of work during the outbreak. Congress allowed those payments to lapse on Aug. 1, and negotiations to extend them were mired in partisan gridlock.
Through Trump's order, benefits will be lowered from $600 to $400 per week.
""It's $400 a week, and we're doing it without the Democrats,"" Trump said, asking states to cover 25 percent of the cost. It was not immediately clear where the federal portion would come from — though the president suggested he was looking to use unspent funds from previous coronavirus relief bills — and Trump said it would be up to states to determine how much, if any of it to fund.
Murphy said that the president has offered a $400 benefit, but has offered no clear guidance as to how states will pay for or even administer this program.
""Millions of unemployed workers and their families deserve better,"" he said. Numerous experts have already spoken out and said that this plan will have little if any stimulus effect on our national economy.""
Murphy said that states are going broke and millions of Americans are unemployed and this solution calls for states to create a new program they can't afford to begin with and don't know how to administer because of this uncertainty.
""I cannot sit here right now and say New Jersey could afford to participate in this program. And the president's actions do not provide one dime for state and local governments who are the frontline responders to this pandemic,"" he said. ""Not one dime for our first responders who put their lives on the line every day fighting COVID-19. Not one dime for our educators preparing for the new school year. Not one dime to secure health care for families who have seen their incomes plummet and in many cases their health coverage evaporate.""
Murphy said that the solution is congressional action.
""The House of Representatives has already sent to the Senate a workable plan to extend direct benefits to the unemployed as well as hundreds of billions of desperately needed dollars to state and local governments to ensure that our COVID-19 services don't go dark,"" he said. ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have more than shown a willingness to sit with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and hammer out a deal and get a true stimulus and response bill to the president's desk. The time for political games ended months ago. COVID-19 hasn't cared a wit about which side of the partisan divide it has taken its victims from.""
Murphy noted that as it stands, to follow the executive order New Jersey would have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and that was not a workable solution and that the CARES Act funding would be of little help, if any.
""There's only so much cares act funding. People speak about the cares act as if it is some $500 billion dollar bucket of money. Not only is it limited but there isn't enough money to go around to deal with the variety of tsunamis we're facing,"" he said. ""We're talking about finite amounts here. We need another big slug and big is when I say big I mean big. In New Jersey we need $20 billion with a B. And that dwarves the amount of CARES act money and what is left to be spent.""
Murphy implored McConnell to stop trying to play to a partisan audience.
""There can be no more excuses. We are proving as a state what is possible when we react to this pandemic not according to politics, but according to science and the direct needs of the people we serve,"" he said. ""Please. Get this done.""

Murphy Extends Government Agency Response...,1,6,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY - Governor Phil Murphy extended the deadlines across state government to review and act by a specified deadline via executive order, and it has not gone unnoticed. Nor will it go unchallenged.
""Governor Murphy could not be less transparent about the state's response to the pandemic,"" said Morris County Assemblywoman Aura Dunn. ""He has withheld information from the public and there is no urgency to reply to requests to learn anything. The modified date has been exploited and the law should be reversed.""
For his part, Murphy maintains that Executive Order No. 159 is designed to ease the burden on the state employees.
""As the state government has responded to the COVID-19 crisis, resources have been immensely strained,"" said Governor Murphy. ""Extending these deadlines allows state agencies to continue to be able to meet the needs of New Jerseyans, and provides agencies with crucial time to make decisions with the consideration and input necessary for the long-term benefit of our state.""
Dunn is moving to increase Open Public Records Act (OPRA) transparency by introducing legislation returning the deadline back to seven days from ""any time the government gets around to it.""

The deadline was modified so a custodian of a public record only had to give their best college try to respond in seven days instead of mandating a response within seven days. The change was made because government employees worked remotely and staff may be reduced.

""As things return to normal the reasons for changing the deadline in the first place aren't relevant,"" Dunn said.

LONG VALLEY, NJ - President Donald Trump tapped former Gov. Chris Christie campaign manager and Long Valley native Bill Stepien to be his new campaign manager, replacing Brad Parscale.
""I am pleased to announce that Bill Stepien has been promoted to the role of Trump campaign manager,"" Trump posted tp social media. ""Both were heavily involved in our historic 2016 win, and I look forward to having a big and very important second win together.""
According to the Associated Press, Trump and Parscale's relationship had been increasingly strained, with the president annoyed by the publicity Parscale had garnered in the role. But the final straw appeared to be a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally last month that drew an unexpectedly low crowd of about 6,200 people after Parscale had bragged that more than a million people had requested tickets. The president was furious.
The shakeup comes as Trump has been struggling in his reelection campaign against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, with the nation facing health and economic crises during a pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 Americans.
News of the shuffle was delivered to Parscale on Wednesday afternoon by White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, the AP reported.
Stepien is a Long Valley native, having graduated from West Morris Central High School and received his undergraduate degree from Rutgers University. He worked for Republican State Senator Anthony Bucco and served as campaign manager for former Republican State Representative Bill Baroni, according to his bio.
Stepien also served as campaign manager Christie's 2009 and 2013 campaigns and served as Deputy Chief of Staff until his removal in January of 2014 in the midst of the ""Bridgegate"" scandal. At the time Christie said he ""lost confidence"" in Stepien. Federal officials did not indict Stepien during the subsequent investigation, and he was removed as a defendant in a civil lawsuit over the lane closures.
For his part, Parscale will remain with the Trump campaign as a senior adviser, and he will oversee digital and data strategies.

39,/new-jersey/longvalley/millions-line-2020-census-continues-long-valley,2020-07-16T13:00:00Z,Millions On The Line: 2020 Census Continues In...,0,0,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"LONG VALLEY, NJ - There are a little more than three months remaining for Washington Township residents to turn in their replies to the 2020 U.S. Census.
At multiple points over the last few months Governor Phil Murphy has spoken about the importance of an accurate census at his daily coronavirus briefings, highlighting that all nine million Garden State residents need to be accurately counted.
""In 2010 New Jersey left untold billions of dollars in federal aid on the table, ""he said, noting that both federal and state governments use that data to make financial decisions on aid.
""If that money isn't coming to New Jersey, it's going to some other state,"" Murphy said.
New Jersey's overall self-response rate stood at 64 percent as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Census database. The national response rate was 62 percent.
The U.S. Census counts every resident in the United States. It's mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and takes place every 10 years.
The census is important for several reasons, officials say. Here are a few, according to census.gov:
