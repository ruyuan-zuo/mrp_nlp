April 14, 2020
The COVID-19 outbreak and associated mandated limitations on individuals' ability to work and businesses' ability to operate have created serious economic impacts on city residents and businesses. To assist, the City Council passed an ordinance that removes the base rate from all utility bills for the months of March-April or April-May, depending on each customer's billing cycle. This excludes governmental accounts.
The City's prudent management of the Water-Sewer utility has resulted in the City's high AA+ bond rating which in turn resulted in lower borrowing costs putting the City is in the position to offer some short-term rate relief to customers.
Base rates are identified in GHMC Chapter 13.04 for water service and GHMC Chapter 13.32 for sewer service. Base rates for single-family residences start at $20.22 a month for water and $40.25 a month for sewer. The waiver will cover two full months for all residential and business customers.

The range, called KP Compound, was in violation of local zoning rules, according to county officials.
KP Compound opened recently at 320 205th Ave. Southwest near Lakebay, advertising itself as a private club. The club asks users to donate $11 to use the range, which is only open Friday through Sunday during the evening, according to the club's website.
Pierce County Councilman Derek Young said local residents immediately began complaining about shooting noise. The Pierce County Sheriff's Office visited the range last week and asked that no long guns be used. The code enforcement officer visited on Friday to issue a cease-and-desist order, although local residents did report that the shooting continued over the weekend.
KP Compound has 14 days to appeal the code enforcement action, but that might not do anything, Young said.
""The zoning code is clear, they're not even allowed to apply. It's not a conditional or permitted use in that zone,"" Young said on Monday.
The gun range is in a ""rural 10"" zone in the Key Peninsula Community Plan zoning regulations.
Young said that a shooting range on the Key Peninsula is actually a good idea because the Gig Harbor Sportsman's Club is often at capacity. The only zone that would allow a gun range in the Lakebay area is an amusement and recreation zone."

Jay Inslee hitting his goal of 130,000 donors Gov. Jay Inslee leaving the presidential race and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's upcoming Seattle town hall on Sunday, we wanted to take a look at which 2020 candidates Puget Sound residents are backing with campaign donations.
For this analysis, we used Federal Elections Commission campaign finance data from Jan. 1 to June 30. We only looked at the 18 cities covered by Patch in Puget Sound. Not only did we look at how much money each candidate raked in, we also looked at how many donations they got — and how many of those were from one-time donors.
In general, Puget Sound — except for Inslee — is tracking with national polls in support for candidates. That means people like Bernie Sanders, Warren, and even Donald Trump are pretty popular. There were pockets of support for long-shot candidates like Marianne Williamson and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
Here are some quick takeaways:
Here are the top five by total amount of money raised:
Here are the top five with the highest percentage of unique donors
But none of those candidates — including Weld, who's running against Trump — really have a shot of winning the nomination. Bullock, the governor of Montana, has raised the most out of the bunch at only $33,000. So here are the top five front-runner Democrats with the highest number of individual donations. We're using the most recent CNN poll for candidates with 5 percent support or better.
And finally, here are those five candidates arranged by most donations including repeat donors.
Here's a look at the top five 2020 candidates residents in Gig Harbor only donated to:"

Upon inspection, city crews found that a PVC pipe had been inserted into the sewer line improperly. Debris had gathered around the PVC pipe, causing a backup in the main sewer line.
City officials believe the blockage can be fixed without digging a trench, but the repair will cost a little over $10,000, according to documents. The City Council is being asked to approve the fix so that the city can save time and avoid a competitive bidding process."

Mayor Kit Kuhn on June 3 placed Farris on paid administrative leave to investigate allegations Farris treated women in the city offices differently than the male employees. That investigation — conducted by an outside firm — will reportedly continue, according to Kuhn.
Farris was placed on an individual performance improvement plan in April after Kuhn sent the city administrator a letter of reprimand that cited unprofessional behavior during a job interview. However, Kuhn this week said Farris' official resignation had ""more to do with day-to-day job performance.""
According to The News Tribune, Farris will receive a severance totaling more than $45,000, which the Gig Harbor City Council agreed upon Tuesday during an executive session."

Our first band was Mark Hurwitz and Gin Creek. It was well attended. Our citizens were very respectful and waited till 3 pm to put their chairs out allowing children and citizens use of the park up to three hours prior to the concert.
We had great feedback on Facebook showing thanks and appreciation. Please feel free to bring your items earlier than 3:00 and leave them behind the Skanise House Visitor Center if needed. The City will not be responsible for any lost or stolen items.
South Sound Magazine has named Gig Harbor the ""Best City in the South Sound"" for 2019! Here is what they had to say about our town:
You all play a major role in making our City the best! Great job everyone!
At our last two council meetings several items passed. We renewed several leases and have a basic Professional Service Contract to study what it would take to bring our Masonic Temple building up to compliance for future use. We are also moving towards partnering with the Kiwanis and our Native Americans to have an Honor Symbol at Austin Estuary.
Council also adopted an Ordinance on May 28th making it illegal for pet stores in the city to sell dogs, cats, or rabbits. This ordinance had a lot of support from residents and people from as far away as Puyallup and Bremerton. We hope this ordinance will help discourage puppy mills and the inhumane practices they use.
We also passed phase 1 of our Public Works Operational Center contract to prepare the site for our new Public Works Building at a cost of $2,140,615. That will happen in 2020.
Though we had several good applicants for our in-house attorney we have decided to wait until January of 2020 to proceed with this. As a result, we renewed our contract with Ogden Murphy Wallace through December 2019. We did negotiate a lower hourly rate by extending the contract.
We will probably start the process again to look for an in-house attorney in late September.
We are working hard to negotiate agreements with the Gig Harbor Canoe & Kayak Club and the commercial fishermen to finish the floats at Ancich Waterfront Park. This process will take time and we are working with both groups to discuss their needs and the needs of the community.
Council and I have put in a lot of time working toward getting this done with both parties wishes in mind and we want to be sure we take the time to do what is best for our community as a whole.
The City of Gig Harbor had invested a large amount ten years ago towards the building of the Boys and Girls Club. This money was for our Senior Citizen program that was at the club. The Boys and Girls Club has sold their building to the school district and just yesterday gave back $100,000 to our city. The city will donate this money towards the Senior Citizen program.
Council, with input from our seniors, will later determine if the money will be used for ongoing maintenance or possibly towards a new facility or a combination of the two.
On June 26th, the City will begin accepting applications for funding from our Lodging Tax fund for 2020. This is a chance for groups that are planning events for next year to apply for funding to help with their marketing costs. The goal is to bring in more visitors to Gig Harbor from places 50 miles or 2 hours away or more.
Our Lodging Tax Advisory Committee will review all the applications in October and make recommendations to Council to award funding. Look for the funding application on our website next week.
We are working to add two more volleyball courts at Crescent Creek Park. Since the Sports Recreation Center did not have a plan for them, we felt this was a great alternative for the community. They would be just north of the present two courts and would not have the trees to the north removed. The drainage should be better than the present BMX trail at the top. This would also allow us to work towards a new Pump Track as the BMX is in bad shape.
The Park Commission has supported this plan and we are currently working through permitting. The volleyball group is paying for most of it and the City's financial responsibility will be around $12,000 to $15,000.
Work will start on Stinson Avenue starting July 8th. The water main will be replaced along Grandview between Pioneer and Stinson, and on Stinson from Pioneer down to Rosedale. These streets will be intermittently closed to one lane and there could be delays through these busy intersections.
We will be posting regular updates online, so please be sure to plan ahead and think about alternate routes if needed. On the night of the Beatniks concert at Skansie Park the construction will stop at 2pm to allow access to the concert from many roads.
We awarded TSI a consultant contract for a conceptual design for intersection improvements at Stinson and Harborview. The options that will be considered will be either a roundabout, a traffic light or a hybrid of what is there with improvements of some sort.
All options will be considered. Council will hold study sessions on July 15th and 29th to discuss these options. There will also be an Open House on July 22nd at 4:30 to answer your questions and take your comments on these options.
Next week on Tuesday the 2nd of July is ""Coffee with Kit"" at 7 am at Kimball Expresso. This is for citizens to be able to ask me questions about the city.
I hope everyone has a happy and safe 4th of July.
Cheers,
Kit"

The change is reportedly being made in order to conform with the city and county's adoption of the Next Generation 911 standard.
Next Generation 911 (NG911) is a nationwide update to the U.S. 911 system that will reportedly allow emergency call-takers to process calls from just about any source or format, including voice, text, photo, video-streams, and electronic sensors.
Essentially, the 911 system we currently use was designed and operated in an analog format. With NG911, public safety answering points will be updated to a digital or IP-based system.
""By updating addresses within the city limits to remove the 'NW' directional, city addresses are clearly delineated from the rest of the peninsula,"" Community Development Director Katrina Knutson said in a statement. ""This will aid first responders and hopefully reduce response times.""
When a resident in Gig Harbor calls 911, that call is routed to South Sound 911 in Tacoma. To help South Sound 911 dispatchers quickly and correctly identify the origin of an emergency call, Gig Harbor must get all the addresses within the city limits to conform to the same addressing standard.
Right now, every address that includes ""NW"" does not match the rest of the system, officials said.
South Sound 911 began planning the NG911 update to its systems in 2018. The first step in that process saw South Sound 911's text-to-911 service come online in late March 2019.
In order to bring the rest of the system online, however, a variety of other private, state, and federal partners will need to coordinate their respective roles in the complex update. According to Pierce County, those partners include:
Property owners who will see the ""NW"" dropped from their addresses were notified this month of the forthcoming change, which is scheduled to go into effect Sept. 30.

24,/washington/gigharbor/voter-registration-day-2020-washington-5-things-know,2020-09-21T17:59:30Z,Voter Registration Day 2020 In Washington: 5...,0,0,Charles Woodman,Patch Staff,"WASHINGTON — Since 2012, National Voter Registration Day, has been celebrated annually on the fourth Tuesday of September. This year, that's this Tuesday, Sept. 22. The day is ""a nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy,"" according to the National Voter Registration Day campaign.
The effort to register as many people to vote as possible has increased during the 2020 election season, which includes a presidential campaign amid the global coronavirus pandemic.
""Voter registration is more important than ever this year,"" the organization said in a statement. ""This year, we'll also use the holiday to raise public awareness not only of voter registration options, but also alternative means of voting across the country.""
Here are five things to know about Voter Registration Day, and how you can take part.
1. Has 'National Voter Registration Day' worked?
Nearly 3 million voter registrations have been made on the day since it began, the campaign said. More than 300,000 Americans registered to vote on the inaugural day, Sept. 25, 2012, and the number has been gradually increasing ahead of election days ever since, with around 800,000 new registrations recorded on the day in 2018, according to date from the National Day Calendar. In 2019, there were 473,725 voter registrations on National Voter Registration Day, a number the organization said is more than three times the previous record during a year without a federal election.
2. Voter Registration Events Near You
The National Voter Registration Day has a directory of planned events, both in-person and virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, on its website. In Washington, there's just one scheduled at North Seattle College Tuesday.
3. Luckily, Online Registration Is Easy
The lack of in-person registration events in Washington is fine, because online registration is simple in the evergreen state. Washington residents have until October 26 to register online. Any time after that, residents will have to register to vote in person. Online registration can be done here.
4. How To Vote-By-Mail In Washington
More than 80 percent of American voters will have the opportunity to vote-by-mail in the upcoming Nov. 3 election, by far the most in U.S. history. However, Washington has voted by mail for years. All registered voters will automatically receive a ballot in the mail, which must be postmarked or dropped off at a collection point by November 3.

5. Know What's On Your Ballot
All eyes will no doubt be on the presidential election, with Republican President Donald Trump seeking re-election against Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden. But the Nov. 3 election will also feature political races at the state, county and local level in some places. Vote411.org, in addition to offering help with registering to vote, has information on what's on your ballot."
25,/washington/puyallup/casting-your-ballot-here-are-drop-boxes-gig-harbor,2020-10-21T01:03:46Z,Casting Your Ballot? Here Are The Drop Boxes In...,0,0,Charles Woodman,Patch Staff,"GIG HARBOR, WA — Ballots have been mailed out to millions of voters across Washington, and tens of thousands of them have already been collected at drop boxes across the state.
But if you haven't voted yet, it might be a good idea to brush up on the final step: putting the signed and completed ballot in one of Pierce County's 46 drop boxes. That's more drop boxes than the county has had in elections past and, the Pierce County Auditor says, enough that 95 percent of Pierce County's registered voters live within two miles of a ballot drop box.
Here are the ballot drop boxes in Gig Harbor:
If you live outside of town or are looking for some alternatives, you can find the full map of all 46 ballot drop boxes in Pierce County below:
If you have not received your ballot, it's not time to panic just yet. For some homes the ballot may still be in the mail— the Pierce County Auditor says not to worry unless the ballot hasn't shown up by Friday.
""If you haven't received a ballot by October 23rd, give us a call 253-798-VOTE (8683) or email us, and we'll do some research, and if necessary we'll mail you a replacement ballot,"" Pierce County Auditor Julie Anderson said. ""We'll cancel the first one that we issued, and mail you a second one.""
Related: Pierce County Ballots Mailed: Here's What To Know For 2020
As for those who have received their ballot and still not cast their vote, officials say sooner will always be better than later.
""Although November the third is Election Day, I call that an election deadline,"" Anderson said. ""You've got 18 days to vote, vote as early as you can. We don't want to rush anybody, but based on my conversations and word on the street, people have pretty much made up their minds, so there's no advantage to delay and it only hampers the election process.""

26,/washington/gigharbor/reminder-thursday-last-day-complete-census,2020-10-14T20:23:29Z,Thursday Is The Last Day To Complete The Census,0,0,Charles Woodman,Patch Staff,"WASHINGTON — Anyone who has yet to fill out the census is cutting it close to the wire: the census officially ends on Thursday, so there are just hours left to get yours in if you have not already.
Tuesday, after a prolonged battle over the 2020 census, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could legally end the count early. As a result, the White House's plan to cut short the census will go ahead, meaning all respondents have until the end of the day Thursday to submit their information.
The results of the once-a-decade census will leave a massive mark on our communities. Census data helps determine how $1.5 trillion in federal funding will be allocated, and how much each area will receive for critical services like hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and more.
That's why activists had pushed to keep the census going for its full duration: in the aforementioned Supreme Court ruling, a coalition of local governments and civil rights groups had sued the Trump administration in the hopes of extending the deadline, arguing that the shorter count would underrepresent minorities and hard-to-count communities, and giving already underserved districts less funding. Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Washington's response rate is above the national average, with 72.2 percent of Washington residents already accounted for. That's also better than the 2010 census, when 62.4 percent of Washingtonians completed the census. Nationally, just 66.8 percent of homes have responded.
Still, Washington's leaders are urging the remaining 27.8 percent of Washingtonians to fill out their ballots before it's too late.
Some counties, like King and Snohomish counties, have very high response rates, but others, particularly rural counties in eastern Washington, do not and as a result could miss out on crucial funds."

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
While vote-by-mail has been old hat in Washington for decades, it is the first time many people across the country will be casting absentee ballots, so the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in the 2016 election, working with ProPublica to bring you information on broken scanners and long lines at the polls in Brooklyn, the extension of voting hours in Durham County, North Carolina, due to technical issues, voting improprieties in Texas, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and much more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:"

In early October, Sheriff Paul Pastor stepped down after 19 years on the job to enter retirement, now the race is on to see who will succeed him.
In the interim, the Pierce County Council appointed Undersheriff Brent Bomkamp to serve as the sheriff until the Nov. 3 election. Voters have cast their ballots, but regardless of who wins, Bomkamp will remain as interim sheriff until the election is officially certified on Nov 24. After that, the winner will immediately take control of the sheriff's department until their term officially begins on January 1, 2021.
The two candidates facing off to be the Pierce County Sheriff are Cyndie Fajardo, former President of the Pierce County Deputy Sheriffs Guild, and Ed Troyer, the current public information officer for the department.
Whoever wins the election will end up at the helm leading over 600 law enforcement officers and corrections officers, as well as nearly 150 civilian personnel serving the Sheriff's Department.
As of 8 p.m. polls have closed in Washington and the first ballot drop for the November General Election has arrived.
In Washington, ballots are tabulated each day following the election, and percentages will continue to change in the days ahead. Results are final upon certification by the Secretary of State's office, due by Tuesday, Nov 24.
This year, several of the state's top offices are also on the ballot, including the governor, attorney general and Secretary of State.

Under state law, all ballots that had been left in drop boxes or that had been mailed and postmarked before the election must be counted.

Instead, drop your ballot in a drop box or at the Pierce County Voting Center.
In rare cases, ballots postmarked on time may take several days to reach election officials, meaning results will continue to shift as the week goes on. Federal law requires states wait three weeks before certifying the election, so the final, exact results of Washington's vote will not be known until Nov. 24."

All ballots that are postmarked by election day will be counted, even if those ballots are received by election officials after the Nov. 3 deadline. But just because a ballot has been mailed out, doesn't mean it will immediately be registered and postmarked, and as a result Washington election officials are urging voters who are voting by mail to have their ballots in the mail by Friday at the very latest to ensure their vote gets counted.

There are 5 drop boxes in Gig Harbor, and below you can find a map of all 46 drop boxes in Pierce County.

For those who want to cast their vote the old-fashioned way in person, there is one polling location in Pierce County: the Pierce County Election Center at 2501 S 35th St, Suite C, Tacoma.
While there is still time left to send your ballot safely by mail, election officials ask voters to consider using a drop box regardless. 95 percent of registered voters in Pierce County live within two miles of a drop box. Drop boxes are also open 24 hours a day until the 8 p.m. Nov. 3 deadline, and are collected at least every 48 hours, with some boxes being emptied multiple times a day. In Pierce County, two employees must be present at all times for ballot collection, and all ballots are transported directly to the election center in sealed containers, ensuring that your vote is secure.
But even if you are voting by mail, the bottom line is: cast your vote sooner, rather than later.

Jay Inslee has announced a statewide cap limiting how much third party delivery apps can charge as delivery fees.
Under Inslee's new proclamation, food delivery apps like GrubHub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash will only be allowed charge up to 15 percent of the price of an order as delivery fees. The total fee, the fee including delivery and other add-ons like service charges for distance, will also be capped at 18 percent. Inslee says the goal is to support restaurants by making it easier and cheaper for patrons to order food.
""We recognize the challenges posed by COVID-19 to our restaurant community, and we're grateful to third party delivery platforms that have made it possible for Washingtonians to continue supporting local restaurants, and allowed many businesses to stay open,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""However, these are difficult times. We all must sacrifice during these uniquely challenging times to both support our businesses and slow the spread of COVID-19. We encourage Washingtonians to support their local restaurants safely through delivery and take-out options that are available.""
Restaurants are on shaky ground during the coronavirus pandemic, made shakier by the governor's recent batch of COVID-19 regulations banning indoor dining at bars and restaurants.
Several cities across Washington, including Seattle, had already imposed similar caps on delivery fees for app-based services.
