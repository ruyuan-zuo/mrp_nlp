""We recognize the significant financial loss and hardship incurred by our food establishment community due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions placed upon their operations.

4,/new-jersey/hillsborough/gov-phil-murphy-vetoes-2-coronavirus-bills-signs-tax-bill,2020-05-29T13:43:50Z,Gov. Phil Murphy Vetoes 2 Coronavirus Bills,0,35,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY. – Gov. Phil Murphy has vetoed two bills that were meant to assist people struggling amid the New Jersey coronavirus crisis.
The bills would have afforded more protections for first responders and suspended rental payments for some small businesses (see bills below).
At the same time, Murphy on Thursday signed legislation (A4157) that temporarily extends the deadline to file a property tax appeal to July 1, and the deadline for county boards of taxation to render decisions in tax appeal cases to September 30.
The bill takes effect immediately and applies retroactively to April 1.
""Our current public health crisis has substantially disrupted many of our routine processes, including the ability of New Jersey homeowners to file timely property tax appeals,"" said Murphy. ""Establishing clear dates for tax appeals and decisions will eliminate the potential for a backlog that would only cause further fiscal uncertainty for taxpayers and municipal governments.""
Here are the bills Murphy vetoed:
Rental payments
Murphy vetoed a bill (S2363/A3921) that would have suspended rent payments for some small businesses.
The bill would have authorized a ""distressed small business tenant"" to suspend payments of rent following the issuance of a ""rent suspension executive order.""
The bill would define a distressed small business tenant as a business that had 50 or fewer
employees on February 10, that leases real property for non-residential purposes, and whose monthly revenue does not exceed 80 percent of the tenant's ""reasonable expectations"" as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Murphy acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic is having a ""devastating impact on small businesses throughout the country and here in New Jersey.""
""Our small businesses are not only the storefront shops that anchor Main Street, they are also the engines of our state's economy, responsible for creating jobs and spurring economic growth,"" Murphy said.
He commended the bill's sponsors for their efforts to identify ""creative measures to sustain our small business community during this extraordinarily challenging time. ""
Murphy, however, said he's concerned about the impact emergency rent suspension would have on the state's non-residential property owners ""who are, in many cases, themselves small businesses.""
""The bill disregards the financial position of the impacted parties, shifting the financial burden in all cases from tenants onto property owners, who may not be relieved of their own obligations
to pay mortgage payments and property taxes,"" he said.
Murphy said direct financial aid, including rental assistance, is a better approach and a ""necessary
lifeline for many small businesses struggling to survive these troubling times.""
Protection for first responders
Murphy also vetoed legislation (S-2351/A3924) that affords employment protection to certain emergency medical responders.
The bill would hace prohibited an employer from terminating, dismissing, or suspending an employee who fails to report to work because the employee is serving as an emergency medical responder during a state of emergency.
Murphy commended the sponsors' efforts to preserve the ranks of emergency medical responders, but he doesn't agree with the bill's premise ""that medical first responders are more essential in an emergency than police and fire first responders.""
""The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on all of New Jersey's first responders,"" he said. ""While this bill would support the staffing levels of emergency medical responders, it would do so at the expense of law enforcement and fire departments.""
Murphy said the work ranks of police and corrections have been ""ravaged"" by the COVID-19 virus.
""I am particularly concerned about how this bill could exacerbate staffing shortages that may result if New Jersey is hit by a second wave of the virus in the fall or winter,"" he said. ""Moreover, because the bill is not limited to the COVID-19 emergency, I am concerned about the unintended consequences it could have on the state's ability to effectively respond to the unique challenges and circumstances presented by future public health emergencies and states of emergency."""

""When the novel coronavirus began to spread in the United States, he became concerned about his ability to protect himself and his wife in the event that the situation developed such that emergency services were unavailable or were not reliably available.

Doherty is also joining several legislators asking Murphy to reopen gun shops that were closed by executive order.
""In many rural areas that have no local police, people can wait an hour or longer for the State Police to respond to a call for help even in the best of times,"" said Doherty, Republican. ""What's going to happen when more police departments, including the State Police, start experiencing real staffing issues due to the coronavirus? In an emergency, families in some of our communities might have to wait hours for a response, which is just too long. Governor Murphy should follow the lead of Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania and allow New Jersey's gun stores to reopen. His personal dislike of firearms does not diminish the 2nd Amendment rights of New Jerseyans during this crisis.""
Gun shops were forced to close on March 21 when Murphy signed Executive Order No. 107 ordering the closure of all non-essential retail businesses. This also caused the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to be taken offline.
""With armed State Troopers at his side, the governor has little to worry about,"" Doherty added. ""That's not the reality of many New Jerseyans who must guarantee their own security. Governor Murphy should do the right think and recognize that businesses that help protect many New Jersey families are essential businesses should be allowed to operate.""

She was also a member of the Somerset County Planning Board in 2007 and was chosen as outstanding woman in Somerset County in 2008 for Public Service.
""Hillsborough has been lucky to have Committeewoman McCauley serving the residents of this town,"" Hillsborough Republican Chairman and Former Hillsborough Mayor and County Freeholder Ken Scherer said. ""As only the fourth female Mayor in Hillsborough's history, Gloria led with distinction throughout her time on the committee.""

HILLSBOROUGH, NJ - Affordable health care is challenging for the average American and can be a barrier for those without the resources for today's health care costs. The United State is the wealthiest nation in human history, yet for more and more families, a single healthcare crisis causes financial ruin. Medical debt has become the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States, with as many as 500,000 Americans filing each year after seeking medical treatment.

""We are pleased to present this informational event for the benefit of residents who would like to learn more about the impact that the Medicare for All proposal could have on their lives, livelihoods, and the American economy in general.""

""This is just the beginning,"" said Holmes-Ammons. ""In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police, and in honor of so many other Black lives lost to police brutality, Black mothers are coming together to say no more. We are directly engaging our local law enforcement agencies, our politicians, our entire communities!""
The vigil will be held from 10 a.m. to noon, at the Otto Kaufman Community Center, 356 Skillman Road, in Skillman.
The Montgomery vigil will follow the same format as the first vigil that occurred on June 7 with the Princeton Police Department. The vigil featured a moment of silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, group meditation, first-person accounts from the Princeton community about fear of law enforcement and over policing, and a dialogue and Q&A with the police. Read More: Black Mothers, Princeton Police Pray For Racial Equality
Since the first vigil, Holmes-Ammons has connected with numerous Black mothers and allies working together on the redistribution of public safety budgets for social services, education, and the arts.
Supporters of the Sunday vigil are encouraged to center Black mothers, bring a chair or yoga mat, wear masks, and maintain social distance.
For more information contact Holmes-Ammons at blackmothersrising@gmail.com or facebook.com/BlackMothersRising.
The vigil follows nationwide protests sparked after Floyd, 46, died after then Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Video, which captured Floyd saying ""I can't breathe,"" went viral, and sparked the nationwide protests. Read More: All 4 Minneapolis Officers Charged As Protests Continue

""Our goals are twofold,"" Gov. Phil Murphy said when he made the announcement in May. ""To maximize our democracy while minimizing the risk of illness. We want everyone to participate in a safe, fully democratic process.""
Murphy also said that there will be polling places open in every municipality to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to vote and at least 50 percent of the normal locations per county.
Murphy added that voters who have not been able to seamlessly transition to a mail-in process, like those with a disability, will be kept safe when they cast their vote.
""Social distancing protocols will be enforced within these polling locations including the sanitizing of every touch screen, voting machine in between voters,"" he said.
All registered Democratic and Republican voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail ballot while all unaffiliated and inactive voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail application. Those ballots can be sent back by mail or dropped in one of the boxes.
Where To Vote: In-Person
Hillsborough
Montgomery
Vote-By-Mail Drop Boxes
Vote-by-Mail Drop Boxes will be installed at the Hillsborough Township Municipal Building, 379 South Branch Road in Hillsborough and Franklin Township Municipal Building, 475 Demott Lane, in Somerset.
Another key change will be the voting deadline. While all the ballots must still be postmarked by the July 7 election day, Murphy said that the deadline which votes must be received by a county board of elections – to be counted as valid – will be extended from 48 hours after the polls close to seven days after the polls close.
""We expect a greater than normal vote-by-mail turnout the deadline,"" he said. ""And we will ensure that every vote is counted.""

Are you running for office in Hillsborough? Contact Alexis Tarrazi at alexis.tarrazi@patch.com for information on being featured in a candidate's profile and submitting campaign announcements to Hillsborough Patch.
Why are you seeking elective office?
Being a Hillsborough resident since 1993, I have seen many changes to our town during this time. It has always been my interest to be involved in my community. Given my ability to now dedicate my time to public service, I would like to be an integral and active participant on the issues that face Hillsborough going forward and believe my background has equipped me well for the position for which I seek. The decision not to seek re-election by Committeewoman Gloria McCauley provided me the opportunity to run for Township Committee and build upon the solid work and leadership established by both current Mayor Doug Tomson and Committeewoman McCauley. In preparation for running for Township Committee, I have been an active member in township government through my appointment to the Economic and Business Development Commission where I served as Vice Chair in 2019 and my appointment to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. Knowledge gained from my experiences on these boards would only enhance my ability to serve effectively on Township Committee.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Should I be fortunate enough to be elected to Township Committee, upon taking office the most pressing issue will be navigating the post-COVID-19 world; namely the financial impact to our municipal budget that will result from federal, state, and county level budgetary reductions and how those cuts will impact our businesses, our municipal services and our residents. Ensuring that safety nets are in place to help those in need will be of utmost importance. Municipal revenues and resources will continue to be impacted in the coming years. I will utilize my experience and working knowledge of local and county government to ensure that we are working to maximize the use of our financial resources to continue to provide the services that our residents have come to expect and deserve.
I am confident that we will get through the challenges presented in the post-COVID-19 world but it will be just as important to continue to maintain a focus on the impact that state and court-imposed affordable housing mandates will have on our local infrastructure and services and the need to plan accordingly.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Every candidate brings their own strengths and experiences to a campaign and I am running against a varied group of candidates. The critical difference between me and my opponents is the diverse experiences I have acquired working in both municipal and county government and in the private sector as a business owner. Coupled with that is the wealth of experience I have gained assisting residents and businesses in my role on the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the assistance I have been able to provide to our business community through my role on the Economic and Business Development Commission and the ability to coordinate efforts with the different departments in the Township as I served on the Task Force to Open Hillsborough during the COVID-19 shut down.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
In keeping with the work of the current republican led Township Committee, I will strive to be fiscally responsible; maintaining the 2 percent budget cap, preserving the township's AA+ bond rating, and seeking to acquire open space and preserving our farmland.
Managing the financial end of my husband's business taught me the importance of operating within a budget and how being fiscally prudent leads to the overall success and financial health of a business. I would bring this mindset to my position where it would govern my financial decision making on the Township Committee. Being a member of the Economic and Business Development Commission, I serve as a liaison between our business community and the Township Committee. In this role, I work with our business community to support and promote their success through a variety of means; including the creation and implementation of Restaurant Week, promoting Take Out Tuesday for restaurants during the current COVID-19 restrictions, and garnering a social media presence for the Hillsborough Business Administration. Being elected to Township Committee would enable me to further support our business community where my focus would be assisting them with resources necessary to thrive in a post COVID-19 world. During this pandemic, our farming community has played an integral role in keeping basic food supplies available to our residents when supply chains have been taxed. It spotlights the need for preserving our farmlands and assisting farmers so that they can continue operating for the next generation. Preserving the beautiful, rural aesthetic and agricultural history of our town would be a focus of my role on Township Committee and I would look forward to working with the appropriate committees to that end.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Always work hard and do your best in all that you do. ~ Advice from my father
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
While I was a stay-at-home mother raising my three children for 19 years, I was always active outside of the home. I managed the financial records for my husband's Physical Therapy practice, volunteered my time at my children's schools, and worked in the office of the Mayor and Administrator of Hillsborough Township. Now that my children are older, I am lucky to be an employee of the Somerset County Park Commission; which gives me valuable experience at the County level, and to volunteer my time to various township committees and organizations. My diverse background in municipal public service and business ownership, as well as my experience with certain facets of municipal and county government provide me the skill set needed to lead Hillsborough forward. I love Hillsborough, I am thankful to have raised my family here, and I welcome the opportunity to work with the Township Committee to continue to make Hillsborough ""One of the Best Places to Live in America""."

""This budget is a result of our team's continued fiscal responsibility regarding municipal operations, despite continued operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"" stated Mayor Doug Tomson.
The committee met on June 9 to unanimously introduce the $29.9 million budget which is $172,000 less than the 2019 budget, Chief Financial Officer and Tax Collector Nancy Costa said.
Costa noted the township saw an increase in tax rateables allowing the municipal tax rate to be reduced for the third year in a row.
While the Hillsborough Township School Board and Somerset County portions of the tax rate have increased from 2015, the Township's tax rate has decreased by 1.4 cents since 2015.
Overall residents will see an increase of .316 cents per $100 of the $350,000 average assessed home. This is less than the increase of .319 cents in 2019.
""When we heard about COVID and all the disasters it could be bringing along, we really started to panic,"" Committeewoman Gloria McCauley said.
McCauley noted that Costa ensured the committee that most of the township's revenues were continuing to come in allowing the committee ""to deliver this budget with such great news. It was shocking. A relief that we can cover the budget this year.""
A public hearing before the budget is finalized will be held on July 14. The budget is currently available for residents to review on the township's website at hillsborough-nj.org.
""This budget is a direct result of the Township Committee's commitment to continued fiscal responsibility; working efficiently while providing our taxpayers the same level of service excellence they expect and deserve,"" Tomson said.

Many more came prepared with lawn chairs and coolers after it took some residents about 5 hours yesterday to get to the front.
Walter of Manville arrived in Somerville at 5:45 a.m. on Tuesday and made it almost to the front door at 1:30 p.m. when he was told they weren't talking anymore people.
During that time Walter made friends with other line-mates including Anderson Moronta of Manville. On Wednesday morning they texted each other and met up again at 6 a.m. When they arrived they were already number 188 in line.
The MVC capped the number of people to 250 on Wednesday and handed out tickets.
Marco Tejema of Elizabeth waited in line yesterday in Rahway but said it ended up being shutdown due to fights. He is trying his luck on Wednesday in Somerville.
""This is an essential service and needs to be open,"" Tejema said of the MVC during the coronvirus. ""It was stupid for them to shut it down.""
Elizabeth and her son Chrystian Muhleisen of Belle Mead are ""dividing and conquering"" on Wednesday. The mother and son arrived at 5:50 a.m. and were already in line for 5 hours waiting for registration for Elizabeth's daughter Jules Muhleisen.
Jules on the other hand is waiting in Flemington with her grandmother to get her license for the second day. She has been waiting since June 25 to get it. Jules waited 8 hours in line in Flemington on Tuesday just to be turned away so the family decided to split up on Wednesday to double their chances.
""It's better than it was yesterday,"" Elizabeth said. ""But they really need a better system.""
A Twitter user @caitmau5_ shared video of the long line on Wednesday in Somerville that appears to follow Union Avenue (Route 28).
""We've been swapping off at the somerville dmv since 8pm last night i h8 this state,"" @caitmau5_ tweeted.
After being closed for more than four months, all New Jersey MVC centers reopened to in-person service Tuesday. The state was set to reopen the MVC on June 29, but delayed the opening to July 7 due to continuing concerns about the coronavirus.
Murphy acknowledged the issues as frustrations mounted and lines stretched for the second day at motor vehicles offices across New Jersey, as service resumed after nearly four months of being closed. Read More: NJ Extends MVC Days, Halts Furloughs As Frustrations Mount
""I completely understand the frustration felt by every customer forced to wait on long lines as we reopen and deal with the months and months of backlog caused by the pandemic,"" he said during his coronavirus pandemic briefing. ""You're upset about this, so am I. ... We will do better.""
Murphy said all motor vehicles commission staff will be exempted from the state's furloughs, which began June 29 as the state grapples with the impact of lost revenue due to the pandemic. Read more: NJ State Worker Furloughs Could Begin This Monday
In addition, the commission has rescinded its plans to be closed on Mondays through July and instead will be open six days a week (closing only on Sundays) beginning Monday.
Tuesday's lines were also long with many residents waiting about 5 hours. Read More: Somerville MVC Reopens To 5 Hour Long Lines, Traffic Jams: Video
Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick spoke out against Murphy on Tuesday after he visited the Motor Vehicle Commission agency in Springfield.
""This is why people are frustrated with government,"" said Bramnick (R-Union). ""Total chaos could have been avoided if the MVC at least handed out numbers as people arrived. People cannot tell where the line begins and there is no communication. This is unacceptable. The department has had more than three months to prepare for this but has failed the people of New Jersey yet again.""

Why are you seeking elective office?
I truly believe that I can help to make Hillsborough a better place to live and thrive. There needs to be a re-dedication and focus on community building within our government at every level in this country, and I believe the best place to start is at home. I am willing to take on the tasks and responsibilities that come with holding public office. I would be honored to bring my energy, work ethic, insights, and talents to represent the best interests of the people of Hillsborough.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our town is the failure to do smart, innovative community-focused town planning. The lack of planning combined with hostility to our affordable housing mandate has left the town vulnerable to builders with little regard for environmental housing concerns, the strain on our infrastructure, and our increasing tax burden. Future generations risk inheriting a town overtaken by sprawl, unaffordable for young professionals, damaging to the environment, and stressed, overcrowded schools. Some older residents are at risk of being displaced, unable to afford to live in the town where they have raised a family and invested a lifetime of taxes.
Continuing down the road of making living in Hillsborough out of reach for both lifelong residents and younger professionals is not acceptable and I will address this issue with resident-focused, innovative, and forward-thinking planning. The focus on strategic, professional town planning that is responsive to our current residents while promoting thoughtful, sustainable growth based on community input will serve to preserve what we love most about our wonderful town.
Among my key initiatives will be resurrecting the Main Street Hillsborough project in conjunction with a revitalized Master Plan for a bold new vision of the future of Hillsborough.
More than two decades ago, a pedestrian-friendly Main Street and Town Center was proposed and designed for Hillsborough. Professional and inspiring architectural plans were drawn up and community feedback gathered, but the effort was sidelined and eventually abandoned for reasons unknown to the public.
Since then, we have seen rapid, disjointed growth, especially of single-family homes. I understand growth is necessary, but it must be planned and zoned carefully so that we responsibly provide opportunities for all residents including young families and professionals with modest incomes, while simultaneously managing the challenges to our municipal services.
We must also be careful not to place an unmanageable tax burden on our older populations, and safeguard Hillsborough's incredible natural resources by protecting our environment.
Currently, the proliferation of luxury single-family homes is stressing our education budgets and displacing our seniors who have invested so much in Hillsborough but fear that the tax burden will threaten their ability to stay in their homes. With the Hillsborough Route 206 bypass nearing completion, much of the traffic that made it relatively easy to visit local businesses is now literally bypasses their storefronts. In a post-pandemic Hillsborough, revitalization is essential. We must promote new zoning and opportunities to eliminate long-empty storefronts. We have affordable plans to encourage builders and property owners to create town center spaces attractive to our young adults and older residents.
The decades-long concern regarding the need for safe and engaging options for our teenagers must be addressed. A strong community nurtures the soul of its young people. A pedestrian friendly town center, with thriving businesses and residences for young professionals would allow us to create opportunities for young and old to improve their quality of life. A strong town center will promote the unique flavor and culture of local shops and assorted business that would be located there.
Main Street would act as a hub for cultural events, business spotlights, farmers markets, street fairs, and more. It would allow the people of Hillsborough the opportunity to enjoy a unique commercial and residential center while helping local shops and businesses attract more customers and flourish. We can have it all in Hillsborough, beautiful, quiet, scenic neighborhoods and parks, historic homes and landmarks, preserved open space, and a charming and vibrant Main Street.
A walkable and thriving Main Street for Hillsborough is a win-win for residents, businesses, and surrounding areas. A Main Street would strengthen our economy, lower taxes by expanding the tax base, strengthen the social fabric of our town, resulting in resiliency, stability and an overall sense of wellbeing for residents.
Hillsborough is a jewel, let us all treat it with the vision, respect, and smart decisions that our residents deserve.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
The difference between me and the other candidates is my three-decade-long personal history of commitment to the Hillsborough community. As a 34 year home-owner and Hillsborough business owner, family and community are the most important values I hold and I have a track record that demonstrates those values. I left a prominent manager-level corporate career where I successfully overcame gender and racial barriers, to make an investment in my community by founding a local music and theater arts school. Using my training as a mathematician and computer scientist, and my experience as a senior AT&T project manager, I was able to transfer my skills and build a thriving arts business. I have mentored generations of young musicians, actors, and education professionals while providing important employment and contributing to the tax base of our community. The soul of a community lies in the institutions that nurture the education, spirit and well-being of its residents.
Theater and music programs create homes for creative people in a community who, in turn, bring so much value to our lives. I am honored to have been part of the journey of so many in our community.
In 2009, we lost my 17-year-old son who suffered from depression. I understand the devastation of mental illness and the critical need for education and prevention efforts. This led to my founding the annual Hillsborough Music Festival to both celebrate and encourage artistic expression, and raise funds for youth suicide prevention. The Hillsborough Music Festival has grown into an important source of funding and education for mental health as a grassroots collaboration between local artists, local businesses, Hillsborough Township, the Board of Education, and our community.
This investment of time and energy in my business, and the Hillsborough Music Festival has served to strengthen my leadership, and fundraising abilities, and mobilizing volunteer efforts in our community.
I have learned to leverage collaborative efforts among local government, non-profits, businesses and individuals to benefit the greater good of the Hillsborough community. This experience in creating synergy, collaboration, and cooperation is exactly what I plan to build on if I have the honor of being elected to represent our outstanding community as a member of the Hillsborough Township Committee.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)?
Hillsborough must shed its reputation of being difficult to do business with. The overly bound business and residential permit system has resulted in vacant storefronts and frustrated residents looking to make home improvement. For example, the Cost-Cutters storefront has been unoccupied for a decade.
Many townships have ordinances that prevent indefinite vacancies. As compared to nearby municipalities with similar challenges, our permit process is infamous.
Homeowners regularly encounter reputable contractors who reject desirable project inquiries once they realize it is in Hillsborough and no longer have the appetite to deal with the cumbersome approval processes currently in place. We need to examine and correct this issue which is a deterrent to new businesses considering Hillsborough, and homeowners trying to improve their property. It will take time, but our process and reputation is fixable. We strongly believe in the talents and abilities of our municipal employees, and we owe it to them to invest in the best processes for them to efficiently do their jobs. With the talent and skills in this township, I am confident that with good leadership we will sort this out and Hillsborough will become known as a township with clear requirements and safety standards making it ""easy to do business with.""
As we revitalize our Master Plan and create responsible and sustainable development, we will create economic incentives that strengthen and attract quality businesses, enhance and strengthen our tax base, support our education budgets, and improve our quality of life.
As we revitalize our Master Plan and create responsible and sustainable development, we will create economic incentives that strengthen and attract quality businesses, enhance and deepen our tax base, support our education budgets, and improve our quality of life.

Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
Mental Health: The mental health of our community and its members is now more important than ever before. Having lost my youngest son to depression, this mission is deeply personal to me. The conversation about mental health in this country is still routinely stigmatized, and I am looking to help end that stigma in Hillsborough, especially among the youngest and most vulnerable populations. We must approach mental health and well-being as a public health issue and building a stronger sense of community throughout Hillsborough is just the first step in that process. The success of the already implemented BoroSafe programs are a wonderful start. There is also a need for more comprehensive mental health resiliency programming across the board.
Creation of a Community Space: Hillsborough is a beautiful town, with so many beautiful and unique natural attractions. We would benefit greatly from a more pedestrian-friendly and locally flavored town center to serve as a gathering place for the members of our community. This cannot happen overnight, but with a long-term commitment to people-centered, environmentally friendly town planning, it can happen. We need a recognizable town center for the culture and the ""soul"" of the township and its residents to continue to flourish. Hillsborough can be an even more popular and unique destination for the local community and beyond.
The Environment and Sustainability: in order to ensure the long term health of our residential and business community, it is equally important that the open spaces in which the community exists are protected and preserved. We must control sprawl and over-development, and be dedicated to moving forward with long term environmental and sustainability projects. We must preserve the green spaces and quality of life we already have while ensuring that the natural beauty and historic character of Hillsborough are protected for generations to come.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I am proud of the work that I did at AT&T, starting as a Unix and C programmer and then rising to senior project management in networking and information systems. As one of the very few women and among only a handful of African-Americans in the industry, I learned to build effective coalitions, overcome obstacles, and lead teams that have made world-impacting contributions in telecommunications.
After completing the Y2K rollout in 2000, I left AT&T to focus exclusively on the business I had founded—The Allegra School of Music and Arts in Hillsborough—which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. I knew that there was a need for cultural institutions in my community, and I decided that I would be the person to help fill that gap. As a business person and experienced manager, I learned how to build a dynamic team of arts professionals, and through collaboration and dedication we were able to grow Allegra into a long-standing Hillsborough institution.
I also founded the annual Hillsborough Music Festival to celebrate the tremendous artistic talent here in town, promote local businesses, and to bring more community engagement in collaboration with the Township. The music festival evolved into a fundraiser for mental health awareness and youth suicide prevention. I believe that cultural events such as this are critical to strengthening community bonds. My work creating an annual charitable event is a perfect example of how conscientious local businesses, local artists and volunteers, and local government can collaborate to do something important and enriching for the people of the community.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Lead by example: my mother, who now lives in Hillsborough, was a working woman who raised five children, balancing a career in nursing while saving to purchase her own Brooklyn brownstone where we lived, and rented to tenants on the top floor. Her industriousness showed me that a woman can build and fix and do anything. I was the eldest of five children and she gave me tremendous trust and responsibility. She also made me feel that my brains and grit would be my greatest assets.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I think the most important thing people can know about me is that I am not afraid of new challenges. I am comfortable with being uncomfortable. This attitude allows me to approach almost any situation with a very unique viewpoint. I am willing to step up and throw myself wholeheartedly into any task I set my mind to. I make sure to always listen and take input from those willing to be involved in the process, and I strive to make the best decision for any given situation. I look forward to serving the people of Hillsborough with the same passion, vigor, and fairness that I have always brought to my professional and personal life. When it comes down to it, Hillsborough is a community of neighbors and I look forward to being your trusted representative who is also your neighbor."

Why are you seeking elective office?
My life has been focused on public service, both prior to and after becoming an attorney. I have had the opportunity to work and learn at many levels of the federal and state government as well as on a local level in our Township promoting positive change. I have seen how government works and I have seen why sometimes it does not. I believe that my experience, combined with a proven track record of implementing positive change, makes me uniquely qualified to represent the diverse interests of the people of Hillsborough. I know that I can help make Hillsborough an even better place to live and I am committed to working hard on behalf of our residents to do exactly that.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
We need long-term planning and a vision for how decisions should be made to benefit the people who live here. I will represent the interests of the people and help make decisions that will benefit our community as well as our environment. I plan to revisit and revitalize our Democratic principles and our Master Plan for Hillsborough's development so that it presents a clearer, more cohesive, and forward thinking strategy for the future of our town.
The single most pressing issue facing our state/nation is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation is the federal government's failure to practice good government. With the Coronavirus, calls to stop racial injustice, climate change and income inequality to name a few, the President and his Executive branch have failed to tell the American people the truth and failed to provide help and support when it has been most needed. This failure to provide the needed leadership at the top has hurt all Americans and that's Democrats, Republicans and Independents.
The American people need real leadership based upon the ideals from the Constitution and based upon science and the truth. People need to have confidence and trust in government and that is true on a local level as well.
My life has been focused on public service, both prior to and after becoming an attorney. I have had the opportunity to work and learn at many levels of the federal and state government as well as on a local level in many Townships promoting positive change. I have seen how government works and I have seen why sometimes it does not. I believe that my experience, combined with a proven track record of implementing positive change, makes me uniquely qualified to represent the diverse interests of the people of Hillsborough and I will add a level of honesty, integrity and character the local level. I am focused on helping people, not special interests. I know that I can help make Hillsborough an even better place to live and I am committed to working hard on behalf of all residents to do exactly that.
My years of experience being involved in government will help establish new ways to govern more openly, effectively, efficiently and politely. I intend to examine new ways to streamline and expedite the needed services for the people of Hillsborough. I have a history of working in the system to get real results, and I will do the same for Hillsborough.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
The critical differences between myself and the other two candidates that I am running against are striking. One has little or no experience running government and the other has become a career politician feeling comfortable ignoring people who question that absolute power thing. Both of those extremes do a disservice to the public, since no experience is not be helpful and career politicians often forget why they are there.
I bring diverse experience working effectively in the federal government, the State government and I have extensive experience in local government. I have worked directly with the governing bodies, the boards and commissions and the public to unite diverse residents and stakeholders helping to write ordinances, master plans and other public service documents. I understand how to work across the aisle since my focus is on improving the community and not simply supporting one party or the other.
My campaign running mate, Donnetta Johnson also brings a wealth of skills to this campaign.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)?
The Township Committee is failing the residents of Hillsborough by excluding the public from active participation in the governmental decisions that impact our lives on a daily basis. There is not sufficient transparency in Hillsborough. This costs the taxpayer money, since decisions are bring mad every day that causes changes and new growth and that can be very costly if not done with full disclosure and involvement from the public. In the current age, truth and transparency are more important than ever. People have lost faith in their governmental institutions and processes and I seek to restore that faith. If I am elected, I will serve the people and I will be proud to do so with full transparency. I will expand accessibility to all Township information, like applications for development and demonstrate credibility by increasing transparency of that information and making sure that our citizen Boards and Commissions have members who actually have knowledge of the subject group they serve on. The party affiliation of members to those boards is irrelevant and I will seek those who have competency to serve. I will be honest about what it costs to operate government and look for ways to be more efficient and creative to save taxpayer's dollars. We can all help make better decisions, and that will mean better government for Hillsborough.
I will work for open, transparent and accountable government and change these current practices and welcome public participation. This change will allow for better decisions that will best serve all residents now and in the future.

Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
A Return to Good Governance: My years of experience being involved in governmental processes at all levels has shown me that there are those who use government to thwart change and slows down important governmental decisions. I plan to rely on my knowledge of government to help streamline and expedite my ability to serve the people of Hillsborough. I have a history of working in the system to get real results, and I will do the same for Hillsborough.
Governmental Transparency: In the current age, truth and transparency are more important than ever. People have lost faith in their governmental institutions and processes and I seek to restore that faith. We are elected to serve the people, and we should be proud to do so with full transparency. I will expand accessibility to all Township information, like applications for development and demonstrate credibility by increasing transparency of that information and making sure that our citizen boards and Commissions have members who actually have knowledge of the subject group they serve on. This is one way that I will help our residents hold us accountable.
The Environment and Sustainability: I have spent my career fighting to make sure that our environment is protected not only for us, but for the next generation as well. The quality of life for the people of Hillsborough is intrinsically linked to how we handle the environmental concerns of the Township. By adopting a comprehensive Master Plan for the Township, we can ensure that future changes in the town will be done with the environment and sustainability in mind. Following a plan will allow us to do things like reduce traffic, increase the quality and availability of services, lessen the strain on infrastructure, and improve the overall happiness and quality of life for both our current and future residents.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
While my entire career has provided me with skills and experience that would help me in this role, there is one example that I think stands out. In the late 1980's, I served on Franklin Township's Environmental Commission. During this time, I led an Open Space initiative that would eventually become a part of the Township's Open Space Master Plan. Serving on the Environmental Commission and eventually the Open Space Advisory Committee involved working with members of the local government boards and agencies, with various private developers and development interests, as well as getting a public referendum passed. It took a lot of long hours, hard work, and dedication, but in the end I was able to achieve these goals. Once the referendum passed, it established an Open Space Advisory Committee that was empowered to guide long term development planning and land acquisition to ensure that open space. Farmland, recreation areas and historic structures were protected. The Open Space Advisory Committee would go on to create the Master Plan for Preservation that continues to serve as one of the township's primary guiding documents.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
It may seem counter intuitive, but I think that the best advice I've ever been given is to question authority. In order for our government and institutions to be to be truly accountable, they must be under the constant scrutiny of the public eye. It is crucial for people to be active, engaged, and constantly questioning their leaders in order to ensure that the public interest is truly being served.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
Although I have years of experience in government, I have never held elected office. I am not a politician. I know, that's what politicians say now in order to seem trendy. In my case, it also happens to be the truth. My entire life, I've only ever seen myself as a normal person who is willing to fight hard to champion worthy causes. My concern is towards the issues facing the people of Hillsborough, not the political considerations that surround those issues. I'm willing to work with people on both sides of the isle in order to serve the best interests of the residents of Hillsborough. I firmly believe that every single person can make a difference if they're willing to put in the time and the work required. Positive change requires commitment, and I am ready to commit to the people of Hillsborough to bring about that positive change. I can think of no cause as worthy or as noble as serving the public good on behalf of the people of Hillsborough, and I look forward to having that opportunity."

""We want to show solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement. Show Hillsborough cares and bring attention to the systemic racism affecting the Black community on the local, state, and national level,"" said lead organizer Gabe Salazar.
The vigil will be held from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the soccer fields at Woodfield Park in Hillsborough. Masks and social distancing will be enforced.

Sept. 12, 2020
Our Revolution Hillsborough (ORH) has made it a priority to effect positive change in Hillsborough and proudly endorses Donetta Johnson and David Brook for Hillsborough Township Committee in 2020 because they are equally committed to serving the people of Hillsborough with integrity, transparency, and inclusion.
Johnson and Brook have developed a strong, knowledgeable platform based on their decades of corporate, legal, non-profit and small business backgrounds, which is centered on their belief and commitment to this town. Prioritizing a ""dedication to protecting our beautiful natural environment, planning a prosperous town center for future generations, and—as our community and our nation struggles with the global pandemic and social justice upheaval—ensuring our social fabric remains, fair, strong, and healthy,"" this ticket supports the issues Our Revolution values.
With the motto BOROFORWARD, Johnson and Brook have reached out to constituents throughout the community to understand the challenges they face and the goals they hold for themselves and their families. Donetta Johnson has lived in this town for 33 years and built a business here, and David Brook joined this community 17 years ago, and they know the issues facing this town. Their grassroots movement has hit a chord with Our Revolution Hillsborough, which is a youth-led movement created to challenge the power of the plutocrats and prioritize the needs of people and our planet. We are building a national grassroots movement of local groups powerful enough to win progressive issue fights, elect progressive champions, transform the Democratic Party platform, and eradicate big money from politics. Our Revolution is an inclusive movement where folks from all walks of life are welcome, regardless of their gender, religion, skin color, or legal status.
When Our Revolution Hillsborough planned a rally for Black Lives Matter, Johnson and Brook were there to show their support. When Our Revolution Hillsborough rallied to support the workers at the U.S. Postal Service, Johnson and Brook were there. In our town's first march to support the marginalized, they marched with us. Their platform emphasizes finding common ground on key issues across Hillsborough to improve the quality of life for all, a message which Our Revolution Hillsborough believes in for our community. Currently the Township Committee is made up of a majority Republican members with over half having been on the committee for over ten years. It's time for a change, and that change is Johnson-Brook 2020.
""It is very important we support grassroots campaigns which challenge the status quo of politics in town and that is exactly what David Brook and Donnetta Johnson are set to accomplish,"" said Didier Jimenez (ORH Chapter Leader). The Johnson-Brook Campaign has energized the youth in Hillsborough to participate in the upcoming elections against the entrenched GOP party controlling our town.

Phil Murphy to reopen indoor dining on Aug. 24. Lipani says he is hoping their efforts helped to influence Murphy's decision to allow indoor dining to reopen on Friday amid the coronavirus.
""While opening indoor dining this weekend at 25 percent capacity is a step in the right direction, we remain hopeful through the efforts of our Economic Business and Development Commission's petition to the Governor that increased capacity will quickly follow. Many local restaurants are owned and operated by our friends and neighbors in our community and this has had a devastating financial impact on them,"" said Lipani, who also serves as Liaison to the Economic and Business Development Commission.
Murphy announced on Monday that restaurants across the state will be able to open for indoor dining beginning at 6 a.m. this Friday, Sept. 4, at 25 percent capacity and with social distancing between tables. Read More: Gov. Murphy: NJ Indoor Dining To Resume Amid Coronavirus Crisis
""The level of support for our local food establishments shown by the people of Hillsborough is astounding,"" Lipani said. ""However, no amount of support can bring back the revenue lost due to the loss of indoor dining.""
Natalie Pineiro, executive director of the Downtown Somerville Alliance, shared similar sentiments to Lipani.
""We hope that in a short time the Governor will consider raising those capacity limits even further. The reality is that 25 percent capacity only works while combined with outdoor dining, and even with a mild fall — we're looking at maybe only another six weeks or so of viable outdoor dining weather. And so while we'll take this small victory, we'll continue to advocate with our counterparts across the State for safe/responsible indoor dining at an increased capacity,"" Pineiro said.

Donnetta's campaign is focusing on building and strengthening Hillsborough's communities, increasing transparency in the political and governmental process, and advocating for sustainable and well-planned development that preserves and enhances what already makes Hillsborough Township special.
""Three things that I will never forget about moving to this town over thirty years ago are the pride I felt as a twenty-something when we purchased our first home, the great feeling I always got when I went to Shop-Rite - then the only large market in town, and the mixture of joy and pain I felt when putting my child on the bus on his first day of school.""
Donetta Johnson is a 33-year resident of Hillsborough. A former programmer and project manager for AT&T/Bell Labs, Donnetta is a prominent Hillsborough business owner. She founded The Allegra School of Music and Arts, providing music and drama instruction in Central New Jersey since 1999.

Kai Durant, a representative of Malinowski's re-election campaign, participated in the rally since the Congressman was on his way back to Washington D.C. to vote on legislation that will protect the Post Office.
Durant also read a letter by Malinowski on Saturday stating:
""What's happening to the Post Office right now should be a wakeup call to everyone in this country. The President and his enablers chose to sabotage a government service — a service that our seniors, our veterans, and our businesses all rely on, especially now in the middle of a pandemic — because they believed it would help the President win re-election. That's not editorializing; the president has been candid about it, that this was his way of dismantling vote by mail before November,"" the letter read.
Along with Malinowski, the rally also gained the support of Donnetta Johnson, a Democrat who is running for Township Committee.
""We feel great. This is all new for the Hillsborough community and I think coalitions are important for common goals. We had about 20 people from young teens to older adults,"" said Didier Jimenez with Our Revolution Hillsborough of gaining government official support. ""Repetition is the key and as the team leader, I am looking forward to more collaborations.""
More action was taken on Monday when Malinowski co-sponsored a bill that was passed by the House of Representatives to reverse the recent steps taken by the Postmaster General to slow down the mail.
The Delivering for America Act requires the Postal Service to return to operations and levels of service that were in place on Jan. 1 throughout the duration of the coronavirus public health emergency and requires all election mail to be treated as First-Class mail.
It also provides $25 billion in critical funding for the Postal Service.
""Now more than ever, Americans depend on the Postal Office for everything from prescription medications to absentee ballots,"" said Malinowski. ""Whatever the Postmaster General's motivation for slowing down the mail, it can't be allowed to stand. Today, the House voted to reverse the changes he made — the Senate must now do its part.""

""The lights in our state have been going out more frequently, and for longer durations,"" said Bateman, of district 16 which includes parts of Somerset and Hunterdon County. ""Not only is that an extreme inconvenience for those who lose power for days, it can also be a costly one as perishable foods and prescriptions spoil in the heat. If the power companies cannot restore electric service in a reasonable time, 48 hours, they would be liable to pay for the loss.""
Bateman's bill, S-2836, comes following the most recent Tropical Storm Isaias that left more than 5,000 residents in Hillsborough and Montgomery without lose power on Aug. 4. Restoration did not occur for some until the following Monday or Tuesday. Read More: Restoration Not Expected For Days In Hillsborough, Montgomery
Warren officials recently expressed their displeasure over JCP&L's response in the township after not receiving power for five days to residents. Read More: Warren Officials Express Displeasure Over JCP&L's Storm Response
JCP&L understands the frustration people without power had, JCP&L spokesman Clifford Cole said.
Cole noted that Isaias rose to the level of Hurricane Sandy in terms of the damage left behind. More than 8,000 JCP&L crew members worked to bring power back to customers in the state since the storm on Aug. 4.
""Our crews were working to restore power as quickly as they could,"" Cole said. ""They had large amounts of damage with large trees in the area coming down on electrical equipment.""
Within 72 hours, JCP&L was able to restore power to 80 percent of its customers and all customers by Aug. 10, according to Cole.

Under the bill, a utility customer could recover up to $500 for spoiled food and up to $1,000 for the cost of compromised prescription medications. Customers would be required to submit an itemized list of spoiled goods and proof of loss to the electric utility under the measure.
""This bill would create an additional incentive for power companies to get the lines charged quicker,"" said Bateman. ""There is no excuse for electric customers going without lights for as much as a week or more, but that has been the reality for too many New Jerseyans recently.""

Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., 52, the son of the very popular Gov. Thomas Kean, has served as New Jersey State Senator since 2003. Previously, he served on the General Assembly from 2001 to 2003.
Kean could pose a strong challenge to Democratic incumbent Tom Malinowski, who is running for his second term in the House of Representatives 7th Congressional District. The Kean family name is still very favorable to voters in New Jersey, where the senator's father served as governor from 1982-1990.
Kean's only attempt to seek higher office, however, failed. He lost to US Sen. Robert Menenedez in 2006.
Malinowski was elected to his first term in 2018 and is seeking a second term.
The 7th Congressional District covers all of Hunterdon County, and parts of Essex, Morris, Somerset, Union, and Warren counties.
Malinowski previously served on the US State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor under President Barack Obama. He has also served as Washington Director for Human Rights Watch and Senior Director for National Security Council under President Bill Clinton.

Malinowski says he has been an outspoken advocate in Congress for combating political extremism and violence in the country, including anti-Semitism and the white supremacist groups responsible for most acts of terrorism in our country in recent years.
""I led a successful effort to restore funding the administration cut from the Department of Homeland Security to fight domestic terrorism and extremism, and have cosponsored a bipartisan resolution condemning QAnon,"" Malinowski said. ""While my opponent has endorsed President Trump for reelection and attended his rallies, I have always spoken clearly when the president crosses basic lines of decency and honesty, just as I do when I hear intolerant statements from people on my side of the political spectrum. In these difficult times for our country, I believe we need leaders willing to stand up and say what is right and wrong.""
Kean Jr. lists multiple issues including repairing the healthcare system, creating more jobs, protecting the environment, and improving infrastructure.
""I understand the importance of quality healthcare. I've been a leader on this issue in the New Jersey Senate, serving on both the Health and the Commerce committees. While there, I worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to find solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs, improve maternal healthcare and increase access to mental healthcare,"" Kean Jr. said.
Beginning his career working at the Environmental Protection Agency, this has always been an important issue to him.
""I have built a reputation as an advocate for clean energy and open space in the New Jersey state legislature. I have sponsored funding for offshore wind energy development and passed laws that ensure open space and conservation are well-funded.

49,/new-jersey/hillsborough/letter-editor-resident-addresses-affordable-housing-issue,2020-10-20T23:02:39Z,Letter To The Editor: Resident Addresses...,0,2,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Letter to the editor from Roger Koch:
Oct. 20, 2020
Lately you can't avoid noticing all the construction going on in Hillsborough. The Township Committee under Mayor Tomson authorized various for-profit private developers to build thousands of market priced apartments in two and three story complexes throughout town. The Committee has stated this choice was necessary in order to persuade developers to also build, within the apartment complexes, the few hundred affordable housing units required by our Supreme Court. The Committee has stated private builders cannot make enough profit constructing solely affordable housing units, and need to be permitted to build three market priced units for every one affordable unit.
So every one of the residential complexes with several hundred apartments being built, only contains 25% affordable units. The other 75% are market priced units. It is the far greater number of market priced units in each complex, not the few affordable units, that will cause overdevelopment and resulting overcrowding expected to burden the town.
Town residents have questioned whether a different formula not reliant on providing profits for developers would be a better choice for township residents. For example, in other communities the town chooses non-profit developers to build many of the court ordered affordable units. These developers can afford to build solely affordable housing units without accompanying market priced units. They can do so because their goal is to provide the needed affordable housing, not maximizing their profit. They rely on sources of financing other than personal profit, and seek to provide a valuable public service to the community.
The choice by Mayor Tomson and the Committee to build three times as many market priced units as affordable ones was a subject at a Township Committee meeting on 7/14/2020. It arose in connection with the costly $20 million purchase by our town in 2017 of 300 acres of vacant land, as a settlement of the Hillsborough Properties' lawsuit. Mayor Tomson proudly stated the purchase and its price were necessary to prevent residential development of more than 1000 residences planned for those 300 acres. Committeeman DelCore agreed.
At the meeting, town residents questioned why some of the 300 acres purchased to prevent residential development, wasn't being used for that same purpose, to build solely affordable units without the additional market priced units. If the town would have donated some of the 300 acres, to non-profit developers, it would have helped these developers avoid the cost of purchasing the land and enabled them to construct more solely affordable units without the need to build market priced units. By doing so, the Committee could have further justified the $20 million dollar debt incurred by the town, reduced residential development by eliminating market priced units, and performed a public service for all the people of Hillsborough.
Mayor Tomson suggested the Committee's lawyer Eric Bernstein to respond. Bernstein surprisingly stated no residential homes, including affordable ones, could be built on the 300 acres and that he had advised the court the land was not suitable for residential development. However, this contradicted Mayor Tomson's claim several minutes earlier for purchasing these same acres to stop residential development.
Before the citizens of Hillsborough can trust what Mayor Tomson, and the Committee tells us about its plans for residential development, we need to know whether our mayor and Township Committee are truly basing their decisions on the profits and private interests of developers rather than the best interests of our community.

51,/new-jersey/hillsborough/hillsborough-township-library-odds-over-contact-tracing,2020-10-16T22:46:38Z,"Hillsborough Township, Library At Odds Over...",0,5,Nikki Gaskins,Patch Staff,"HILLSBOROUGH, NJ — Hillsborough Township and the Somerset County Library System appear to be at odds over contact tracing when it comes to COVID-19 safety measures. In a news release, township officials claim that the library system refuses to cooperate, in turn, impacting its hours of operation.
The Somerset County Library System of New Jersey presently operates a branch of the library system at 379 South Branch Rd, which is in the Peter J. Biondi building. This makes the branch a tenant of the township's municipal building.
During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the building was closed to the public, but municipal employees remained working and providing services for residents. On July 6, 2020, the Re-Open Hillsborough Task Force and township officials made the decision to open the building to the public for normal hours of operation, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. until 4:30 pm.
According to township officials, one of the many safety measures put in place to protect the public as well as the employees of the building, including those employees of the SCLSNJ-HB, was contact tracing. This meant that every person entering the building for any reason would be required to sign in at the main entrance.
""The purpose of this practice is to assist public health officials should there be an exposure that involves any visitors to the building,"" township officials said in a news release. ""These practices are in direct response to the ongoing guidance from Somerset County Freeholders regarding contact tracing as well as that of the governor's directives.""
During the planning phase for opening the building to the public, the Reopen Hillsborough Task Force, which included a member from the SCLSNJ-HB, met to discuss necessary safety precautions to be put in place as well as requiring all visitors to sign in to the building, township officials said.
According to township officials, the SCLSNJ's legal counsel advised against collecting patron information due to confidentiality concerns, resulting in SCLSNJ making the decision not to provide coverage for the sign in desk beyond the operating hours of municipal offices, therefore limiting their hours of operation to coincide with those hours of the building.
""Patrons' privacy should be protected. However, there is currently a public health pandemic and cases in New Jersey are on the rise. It is under the governor's directive to conduct contact tracing. The goal is to keep patrons safe,"" township officials argued.
Township officials said it's through the collaboration of the Office of Emergency Management and the township's health officer, that the safety precautions were implemented at the municipal complex.
""As the pandemic continues to unfold, contact tracing remains to be an important aspect of keeping individuals safe. It is critical that this contact information is gathered at the onset of
symptoms, illness or positive test as time is of the essence when this information is needed to be retrieved,"" stated Hillsborough Township Health Officer Siobhan Spano.
""Unfortunately, the library system has offered options that would impact public safety and delay contact tracing,"" added Mayor Doug Tomson.
The township's health officer is the single point of contact for contact tracing for the municipality as a whole, including agencies that operate within the township, such as the library system.To keep both employees of the building and visitors safe, the sign in policy was instituted, township officials said.
Township officials said they are not expecting library staff to actually conduct contact tracing, as the library staff has not been trained in contact tracing, and therefore should not be responsible for gathering and analyzing this sensitive information.
""It is imperative that when contacted individuals provide accurate and complete information to our contact tracers so that we can protect all of our residents. This is a fluid situation and things may change as more information is obtained. Be sure to check your email and return
calls when necessary,"" stated Hillsborough Township Health Offier Siobhan Spano.
""All of this withstanding, the township remains hopeful that the SCLSNJ will make the necessary accommodations to resume pre-pandemic operational hours soon. As I mentioned previously, it is disheartening however, that when individuals contact SCLSNJ to inquire about the hours of the SCLSNJ-HB, they are being told that it is Hillsborough Township who is
prohibiting the weekend hours and limiting residents library access, which is totally not thecase,"" added Mayor Tomson.
The township's attorney and SCLSNJ's attorney have had various conversations in an attempt to resolve this ongoing issue, but that has yet to happen, township officials said. According to the township's attorney, this statute provides that library records which contain the names or other personally identifying details regarding the users of libraries are confidential and shall not be disclosed except in the following circumstances. (Example: The records are necessary for the proper operation of the library.)
Township officials said that given the current COVID-19 pandemic, the records are not necessary for the proper operation of the library. They also added that the library hours are limited because of the library's refusal to obtain and provide these records which are essential to contact tracing and preventing the spread of COVID-19. Also, the sign in information is not a library record as defined by the statute.
The statute defines a library record as any document or record, however maintained, the primary purpose of which is to provide for control of the circulation or other public use of library materials.
Township officials said the primary purpose of the sign in information is not to provide for the control of the circulation or other public use of library materials. The township requirement to obtain this information is therefore not a violation of the statute.
""Hillsborough township's primary goal is to protect the health of its citizens and avoid a COVID outbreak that has already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people,"" the township said.
Last month, township officials said they received a letter from a resident expressing her displeasure with the limited library hours. In Mayor Tomson's response the details of the township's opening plan were provided as well as contact information for the county library administrator, Brian Auger.
This resident reportedly then shared Auger's response with the township, in which he pointed blame on the township for the limited hours, township officials said.
""The response provided to a resident on behalf of the library administrator was disrespectful and not a response conducive of a community partner. Hillsborough Township has always been more than willing to accommodate, assist and foster favorable relations with the SCLSNJ, obviously and especially with the Hillsborough Branch, "" Mayor Tomson said.
According to township officials, they claim representatives of the SCLSNJ are misrepresenting the safety precautions put in place by Hillsborough Township to protect the Municipal Employees, the SCLSNJ-HB employees and those visitors to our Township Building including the SCLSNJ-HB.
Should the SCLSNJ wish to comply with the contact tracing requirements currently established, Hillsborough Township would welcome opening the main entrance to the building for extended and weekend hours to accommodate SCLSNJ-HB visitation, township officials said.
""We remain hopeful that a resolution will be reached at some point, but in the meantime, the township felt it necessary to provide the facts of the situation to our residents. And we continue to modify our operations to keep our residents and employees safe and healthy, and
while abiding by the directives from Trenton, we would hope and expect that partner agencies would do the same,"" concluded Mayor Tomson.
Patch reached out to Somerset County Library Administrator Brian Auger and the library system's public relations director, Carolann DeMatos, for comment. We were provided with this response:"

""Although I have always said signs don't vote, they are the public's first amendment right to have. Let's please be respectful of others,"" Tomson said.
Tomson sent out a letter on Thursday condemning the theft of the signs.
""I am disheartened by reports of, yet again, individuals tampering with political lawn signs,"" Tomson said. ""Nationally and in Trenton, these are turbulent and politically polarizing times – and both parties share in the blame. Let us, here in our community, use this unfortunate incident to reaffirm a policy of zero tolerance for political incivility.""
Tomson noted that those who tamper with (such as stealing or vandalizing) political signs is not only a violation of other people's freedom of speech but they can be charged with theft, criminal mischief and/or trespassing.
""Theft of political signs will be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said Hillsborough Township Police Chief Mike McMahon.
If you believe a political sign is illegally placed, contact Hillsborough Township's Zoning Official, Patrick Gorman at 908-369-8382.

A vote for David Brook for Hillsborough Township Committee is a vote for someone who will represent its citizens with integrity. David is a long time resident of our town and is an active participant in the community. He's also a great neighbor!
As an environmental attorney who has worked at the NJDEP, David has the knowledge and skills to guide our town's development and balance it with mother nature. David once served on Hillsborough's Environmental Commission. Ironically, the Republicans in town did not reappoint him primarily because he asked developers tough questions and tried to hold them accountable. This is truly an endorsement of his commitment to high values and standards.
Someone like David is exactly who we need governing our town to look after our best interests.
Vote early for David Brook and his running mate, Donnetta Johnson, on your mail-in ballot - Democratic Column 2 - no later than Election Day, November 3rd.

Why are you seeking elective office?
I am seeking re-election to continue serving my constituents as we navigate a public health and economic emergency, while protecting the rule of law and our nation's democratic institutions. If reelected, my goals for next year include ensuring federal relief for our small businesses and local governments, achieving significant federal investment in infrastructure to get people back to work, enacting legislation to protect our kids from gun violence, lowering drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate fair market prices with pharmaceutical companies, and building on the Affordable Care Act so that all Americans have access to affordable health care. This year, I helped obtain federal funding for the first stage of New Jersey's all important Gateway rail transportation project; I want to finish the job by securing support for a new Hudson River Tunnel. Having helped persuade the House to pass legislation to restore our SALT deductions, I want to see that bill enacted into law.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Our most urgent challenge is getting COVID-19 under control, and recovering from the economic crisis the pandemic created. I've worked hard over the last several months to get economic relief for small business owners and those who lost their jobs. After passing the CARES Act, which delivered over $2 billion for people in our district alone, my team and I have been working with constituents one person at a time to ensure they get the help they need -- thus far, for example, we have helped over 1,800 constituents cut through red tape in Trenton to get their unemployment assistance. Meanwhile, I've passed legislation in the House to fix our broken national stockpile of medical and protective equipment, and have been insisting that our next COVID-19 relief package provide targeted relief to our state, county and local governments to replace revenues they have lost in the economic crisis. Defeating COVID will require a national plan based on sound scientific guidance. If we have a president in January willing to take responsibility for implementing such a plan, I will work with him to ensure it's properly funded; if we do not, I will insist that Congress hold him accountable.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I've been representing our district in Washington for just under two years; my opponent, State Senator Tom Kean Jr., has been in Trenton for almost 20 years. So we both have a record, and our records are very different. I support the Affordable Care Act; Senator Kean opposes it, while offering no plan to replace it. I support the strong gun laws that protect our kids in New Jersey; Senator Kean voted against most of them, including stronger background checks and limits on the size of ammunition clips. I support a woman's right to choose; Senator Kean repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood. I have been delivering federal aid for New Jersey Transit and the Gateway Project; Senator Kean supported Governor Christie's disastrous decision to cancel the ARC Tunnel. I am one of the few politicians who accepts no campaign contributions from corporate political action committees; Senator Kean has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate PACs, including insurance and pharmaceutical companies. I listen to my constituents, having held more than 60 town hall meetings open to all members of the public since my election; Senator Kean holds no public town halls.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
In addition to delivering economic relief to my constituents and federal funding for New Jersey, I have been an outspoken advocate in Congress for combating political extremism and violence in our country, including anti-Semitism and the white supremacist groups responsible for most acts of terrorism in our country in recent years. I led a successful effort to restore funding the administration cut from the Department of Homeland Security to fight domestic terrorism and extremism, and have cosponsored a bipartisan resolution condemning QAnon. While my opponent has endorsed President Trump for reelection and attended his rallies, I have always spoken clearly when the president crosses basic lines of decency and honesty, just as I do when I hear intolerant statements from people on my side of the political spectrum. In these difficult times for our country, I believe we need leaders willing to stand up and say what is right and wrong.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
Prior to my election, I served in positions of responsibility under two presidents, worked with Republicans and Democrats, including Senator John McCain, to pass significant legislation in Congress, and was unanimously confirmed by a Republican Senate to serve as an Assistant Secretary of State. I hope that my achievements in delivering for my constituents and my accessibility over the last two years will continue to earn their trust.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Take responsibility and share the credit."
55,/new-jersey/hillsborough/4-nj-tax-hikes-take-effect-now-gas-tax-millionaires-tax,2020-10-01T11:39:53Z,"4 New NJ Tax Hikes Take Effect: Millionaires,...",3,229,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY – It's not just the millionaires who are going to may more. Just about everybody in New Jersey is now facing a tax hike.
Three tax hikes have now gone into effect this month, all of which are expected to have a big impact on your driving and your wallet amid the coronavirus crisis (see list, and how much more you'll pay, below).
Drivers will have to cough up a lot more to pay for gas. Millionaires will have to pay more to help balance a state budget depleted by business shutdowns amid the pandemic. And there's also a tax hike that impacts HMOs.
Gov. Phil Murphy said his objective has been to provide ""much-needed tax fairness"" as the state seeks to emerge from the coronavirus crisis ""stronger, fairer, and more resilient.""
The gas tax will help pay for highway and infrastructure maintenance, money for which was depleted when fewer people took to the roads amid the coronavirus shutdowns this year.
The millionaire's tax will help balance a budget also fraught with depleted revenues, and help boost funding for schools and related programs.
""As we continue to grapple with the effects of the pandemic, building a stronger New Jersey requires us to continue to bolster the middle-class families who are the backbone of our state,"" Murphy said.
At the same time, Murphy said he's sought to soften the blow created by the new taxes by providing to rebates to homeowners who have children.
Murphy endorsed the rebates – and some of the tax hikes – when he signed a revised budget into law on Tuesday. Read more: Gov. Phil Murphy Signs Revised NJ Budget: Here's What It Will Do
Here are the tax hikes taking effect:
Gas tax hike
The New Jersey gas tax will jump as the state says tries to dig itself out of a financial hole caused by the coronavirus crisis, officials announced.
The Department of the Treasury announced that lower fuel consumption trends, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, will necessitate a gas tax increase of 9.3 cents per gallon.
Due to the formula outlined in the law, the tax rate on gasoline and diesel fuel will increase on Thursday from 30.9 cents to 40.2 cents for gasoline and from 34.9 cents to 44.2 cents for diesel fuel, officials said.
When coupled with the current 10.5 cent motor fuels tax rate on gasoline and the 13.5 cent rate for diesel fuel, the total tax rates for gasoline and diesel fuel will be 50.7 cents and 57.7 cents, respectively.
The tax will rise to comply with the 2016 law that requires a steady stream of revenue to support the state's Transportation Trust Fund program.
Under the 2016 law signed by Gov. Chris Christie, New Jersey's TTF program is required to provide $16 billion over eight years to support critical infrastructure improvements to the state's roadways and bridges, officials said in a press release.
In order to ensure the state has the funds necessary to support these projects, the law dictates that the Petroleum Products Gross Receipt (PPGR) tax rate must be adjusted accordingly to generate roughly $2 billion per year, the release said.
""As we've noted before, any changes in the gas tax rate are dictated by several factors that are beyond the control of the administration,"" said state Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio. ""The law enacted in 2016 contains a specific formula to ensure that revenue is meeting a certain target.
The state legislature approved a plan four years ago to raise gas taxes by 23 cents, a Christie-backed plan that took effect Nov. 1, 2016. The state Senate voted 24-14 to approve the plan, while the state Assembly voted 44-27 to approve it, with nine not voting, soon afterward.

That year, the state's gas tax increased by 23 cents a gallon to 37.5 cents, an amount that was still less than the neighboring states of New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, according to supporters.
Millionaire's tax
Lawmakers in New Jersey reached a deal on passing a millionaire's tax as well as rebates for homeowners. The deal takes effect on Thursday.
Murphy said the coronavirus crisis has had a staggering impact on New Jersey's economy and the state's middle class ""needed an extra push"" since many people have lost their jobs.
The additional revenue will help provide middle-class tax relief and more money for schools, the governor said.. ""Now is the time that the wealthiest among us are also called to sacrifice,"" Murphy said.
Senate President Steve Sweeney, who has long resisted a millionaire's tax, said his opposition wasn't political, but circumstances have changed since the outbreak began in March.
""The pandemic hit and things have changed and we have to face the reality that a lot of families are hurting here,"" Sweeney said.
The millionaires tax will mean this: a 10.75 percent marginal tax rate currently imposed on income over $5 million will be imposed starting at $1 million in taxable income. This proposal is expected to raise $390 million in FY 2021, officials said.
The deal includes a $500 rebate to families with at least one dependent child whose households earn less than $150,000 per year. The rebate will apply to families with a single parent earning $75,000 or less.
The rebate checks will be based on tax filings next April, so Murphy said he expects New Jersey homeowners will get them during the summer of 2021.
Sweeney and many Republicans have long opposed a millionaire's tax because they feared it would drive more business and industry out of the state.
HMO tax
This plan increases the current annual assessment on net written premiums of HMOs from 3 to 5 percent and raises an estimated $102.7 million in FY 2021.
The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Nellie Pou, D-Passaic, will increase the assessment on Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) premiums to fund charity care payments to hospitals.
""In a time of great anxiety given the deadly coronavirus pandemic, not to mention uncertainty in regard to the future of Obamacare, and when tens of thousands of New Jerseyans are worried about where they'll find the money to pay for health care, this HMO assessment is a shot in the arm, and will help bolster the resources that shore up our safety net for those most at risk,"" said Pou.

""Because the overwhelming majority of HMO enrollees in New Jersey are covered by Medicaid, the bulk of the $162 million in revenue raised will come back to the state in the form of increased federal Medicaid payments,"" Pou said."

""It is WAY too early to call this race,"" Tom Kean Jr.'s Campaign Manager Harrison Neely told Patch. ""Tom Kean Jr. is not out of it yet.""
Neely said there are still many ballots that need to be counted, which he believes are primarily Republicans who waited to vote on Election Day.
""The trend we saw leading up to Election Day is that we saw a heavy Republican turnout and expect a heavy Republican turnout on Election Day as well,"" Neely said. ""The early ballots are probably Democrat and ballots counted in the coming days will be mostly Republican. There is not enough information to make a determination on this race.""
Specifically, Neely noted that in Somerset County roughly 142,000 ballots were counted out of the 180,000 ballots expected to be cast in total based on the ballots sent.
With 386 of 639 precincts reporting in the 7th District on Tuesday night, or 60 percent of the districts, The Associated Press declared Malinowski the winner over Kean Jr.
Union County is reported 124,304 ballots were counted as of Tuesday night out of 372,854 registered voters. Union County will not be updating their results tally until Saturday.
Here are the latest vote totals, according to The Associated Press as of 12:20 a.m.:
Malinowski delivered a speech on his projected re-election on Wednesday, which was streamed to Facebook live on his page - facebook.com/malinowskifornj.
""For me personally this is even more gratifying than my first win in 2018. Back then voters were placing their trust in us for a promise I made. This time voters were making a judgement on what we actually did in the last 2 years,"" Malinowski said.
Malinowski also touched on Presidential Election noting that ""New Jersey did its part,"" alluding to the fact the Garden State voted in favor of Joe Biden.
""We voted clearly to crush this pandemic because that is the only way to restore this economy. Not to mention to protect our health and lives. We voted for leaders who when addressing this pandemic are going to be guided by science and not by some guy on YouTube,"" Malinowski said. ""We voted to fire Trump and keep Dr. Fauci. And I hope that and believe the majority of the American people are with us on that.""
Malinowski also commented on President Donald's Trump tweet declaring victory of the election.
I will be making a statement tonight. A big WIN!

Coronavirus
Tomson and Erickson feel the single most pressing issue facing the community is the coronavirus pandemic.
Tomson pointed to the creation of a task force to help Reopen Hillsborough.
""I looked to the various expertise in functional areas including health, public safety and business. Since the start of the stay at home order, Hillsborough Municipal Services have been operational, despite the building being closed to the public, this task force will be charged with assisting in the roll-out of physically opening the building to the public as well as the rest of the community, including our schools, the library and our businesses,"" Tomson said.
""Should I be fortunate enough to be elected to Township Committee, upon taking office the most pressing issue will be navigating the post-COVID-19 world; namely the financial impact to our municipal budget that will result from federal, state, and county level budgetary reductions and how those cuts will impact our businesses, our municipal services and our residents,"" Erickson said. ""Ensuring that safety nets are in place to help those in need will be of utmost importance. Municipal revenues and resources will continue to be impacted in the coming years. I will utilize my experience and working knowledge of local and county government to ensure that we are working to maximize the use of our financial resources to continue to provide the services that our residents have come to expect and deserve.""
Other issues Tomson and Erickson would like to see address are ""maintaining a budget that is below the 2 percent property tax cap, fighting the draconian unfunded state mandate of affordable housing that keeps destroying our open space and burdening our schools, implementing a plan for a new downtown, continuing to improve infrastructure under our aggressive road paving plan and working to create a new senior center for our residents,"" Tomson said.
Overdevelopment
Brooks and Johnson feel the single most pressing issue facing the community is the fixing the township's master plan.
""The lack of planning combined with hostility to our affordable housing mandate has left the town vulnerable to builders with little regard for environmental housing concerns, the strain on our infrastructure, and our increasing tax burden. Future generations risk inheriting a town overtaken by sprawl, unaffordable for young professionals, damaging to the environment, and stressed, overcrowded schools. Some older residents are at risk of being displaced, unable to afford to live in the town where they have raised a family and invested a lifetime of taxes,"" Johnson said.
""We need long-term planning and a vision for how decisions should be made to benefit the people who live here. I will represent the interests of the people and help make decisions that will benefit our community as well as our environment. I plan to revisit and revitalize our Democratic principles and our Master Plan for Hillsborough's development so that it presents a clearer, more cohesive, and forward thinking strategy for the future of our town,"" Brook said.
Johnson and Brook would also like to address mental health, creation of a community space, the environment and sustainability in the township, and governmental transparency.

HILLSBOROUGH, NJ — The polls are closed and votes are being tallied in a heated Hillsborough Township School Board Election.
There are six candidates vying for the three, three-year seats.
Here are the unofficial results as of 11:54 p.m., according to Somerset County:

Controversy arose surrounding the school board race after the Hillsborough Education Association endorsed Kidd, Marini and Nurse. Incumbents Haas, Harris and Soisson claimed the endorsement was inappropriate and a conflict of interest since the HEA does business with the school district. Read More: Haas, Harris, And Soisson Respond To HEA Endorsement Process
Haas:
Haas has served for 15.5 years on the board and is running for her sixth term. She has achieved the designations of Certified Board Member, Master Board Member, and Certified Board Leader, the highest level of certification from the NJ School Boards Association. She has served two years as President and three years as vice president and currently chair the Education Committee, having previously chaired the Governance, Communications, and Policy Committees. She served on the Curriculum, Finance, Personnel, Operations, Facilities, and Negotiations Committees as well. She has served for several years as Liaison to the Garden State Coalition of Schools and Legislative Representative.
Haas feels the single most pressing issue facing the school district is the coronavirus pandemic.
""It is unprecedented and larger in scope and impact than anything we have experienced. Our district was able to effectively transform into a virtual district last March due to the hard work and initiative of our staff at all levels and our strong commitment to 1:1 technology that was implemented starting in 2011 with my support. We were a leader in this initiative, and our current students and staff benefit from all these years of computer access and competence. At this time, our schools are open to some students for in-person learning and some students are continuing their learning virtually,"" Haas said.
Other issues Haas would like to see addressed in the school district is the budget and state funding.
""We have been blessed with a strong educational program (#15 in the #1 state), excellent staff, and, of course, the best students ever, but we face a constant challenge of budget cuts and inadequate funding from the state. Unfunded mandates and uncontrolled cost increases beyond the 2 percent cap threaten our progress and must be addressed by the state. I have met with legislators from all over the state about this, and I advocate through organizations such as the Garden State Coalition of Schools and the New Jersey School Boards Association,"" Haas said.
Haas also would like to address ""the township's approvals of many new residential developments with no remediation of impacts on already-overcrowded schools. I have testified about this problem at planning board and township committee meetings.""
Harris:
Harris has lived in Hillsborough for 33 years and served on the board for the past three years now. Harris has taught in the Hillsborough Township Public Schools for 23 years, she has a Doctorate in Educational Leadership, Administration and Supervision. She has served on the Hillsborough Sustainable Steering Committee Member for 12 years and is a Rutgers Environmental Steward.
""The single most pressing issue facing our school district is ensuring the health and safety of our students and staff as they come back to school gradually through a hybrid model during COVID, combined with budgeting when the state continues to cut aid to the district,"" Harris said.
Other issues include carrying out work laid out in the 2019 referendum, increasing options for student learning opportunities, to try and improve the communications to the community, and more collaborative effort to work together in this community.
""The district website is a start, but it is not as frequently updated as board members would like (sometimes during COVID information has been revised or changed too rapidly to keep informed without more staffing to provide updates on the website). Residents without children in the district schools need additional ways to receive district information that is of interest or concern to the community,"" Harris said.
Kidd:
Kidd is currently a senior at Hillsborough High School. He attended district schools growing up and has ""paid attention to the issues from the perspective of a student.""
Kidd feels the single most pressing issue facing the school district is the lack of cooperation between the school board and the township committee.
""If we were working as a team we could conserve resources and ease tax costs while improving the lives of students, teachers, and townspeople,"" Kidd said.
Other issues Kidd would like to see addressed include overcrowding, communications, and the buildings.
Marini:
Marini has two daughters (9 and 11) in the district who are attending HES and ARIS and he has served a two-year term as Treasurer of the HES Home and School Association. In addition, he has been a member of the Hillsborough Parks and Rec Commission for over two years and a resident of Hillsborough since 2010.
Marini feels the single most pressing issue facing the school district is for the Board of Education to repair its relationship with both the HEA and its residents.
""This does not mean saying yes to every request, but to ensure that all sides are heard and that the best interests of all interested parties are met in a fiscally responsible manner. Seeking what is best for students and also being fiscally responsible does not mean disrespecting the staff in our schools. I firmly believe that when staff are valued and our budget reflects what is best, that our students benefit,"" Marini said.
Another issue Marini would like to address is better communication, specifically for parents and the community to get information on referendums.
Nurse:
Nurse has lived in Hillsborough with her husband and two daughters, ages 11 and 13, since 2012. She previously taught for five years in Montgomery Township before accepting a job as a staff developer in the Bridgewater-Raritan School District.
Nurse feels the ""most important matter at hand is repairing relationships between the BOE, administration, and the Hillsborough Education Association. Health and safety for students, staff, and the community will also be at the top of my priority list. This includes re-establishing safe and cost-effective transportation to ensure students arrive to and return home from school safely with no extra cost to our families.""
Additionally, Nurse would like to address the board budget.
""Managing and balancing the budget with minimal disruption or negative consequences to students, staff, the district, or the community is an important objective,"" Nurse said.
Soisson:
Soisson currently serves as board president. She was HSA president at Triangle and Auten Road Schools for 6 years and president of the Joint Council of HSA Presidents for six years as well. She first ran for BOE in 2012. During her seven years as a BOE member, she has chaired the Education Committee for two years. She also has been Vice President for two years.
Soisson feels the single most pressing issue facing the school district is implementing a ""quality educational program while keeping everyone safe with ever-shrinking resources, rising costs, and decreasing aid.""
Soisson talk about the need to update the district's buildings beyond the work laid out in the referendum.
""Our facilities need much more attention than that referendum will provide. Since being elected to the Board, I have been advocating for budgeting to cap to fund the capital reserve so that we can schedule longer-term projects and implement these projects with state matching funds when possible at little to no cost to taxpayers,"" Soisson said. ""We need to maintain our excellent programs, staff, and extracurricular activities, which is increasingly difficult with current funding by the state and resource limitations. We must encourage the state to devise a fair funding formula, increase reimbursements for special education, and work with our legislators and local government to ensure that schools are not left out of deals that provide payment in lieu of tax dollars to our township government but not to schools.""
Other issues she would like to address are full-day kindergarten, expansion of gifted and talented offerings, and establish a center of excellence for special education.

CENTRAL JERSEY — The polls are now closed and votes are being tallied in a heated NJ District 7 congressional race in Central Jersey.
Here are the latest vote totals, according to the Associated Press (incumbent*):
Looking at the results so far, 223 of 639 precincts in New Jersey are reporting or 34.9 percent.
Somerset County will be publishing preliminary, unofficial, incomplete results at some point after the ballot counting stops for the day at 11 p.m. Union County plans to start releasing results sometime around 10 p.m. Patch will share these results below once they are shared.
Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., 52, the son of the very popular Gov. Thomas Kean, has served as New Jersey State Senator since 2003. Previously, he served on the General Assembly from 2001 to 2003.
Kean is challenging Democratic incumbent Tom Malinowski, who is running for his second term in the House of Representatives 7th Congressional District.
New Jersey Election Updates: Don't miss local, county and statewide announcements about the general election. Sign up for Patch alerts and daily newsletters.
The 7th Congressional District covers all of Hunterdon County, and parts of Essex, Morris, Somerset, Union, and Warren counties.
The Kean family name is still very favorable to voters in New Jersey, where the senator's father served as governor from 1982-1990.
Kean's only attempt to seek higher office, however, failed. He lost to US Sen. Robert Menenedez in 2006.
Malinowski was elected to his first term in 2018 and is seeking a second term.
Malinowski previously served on the US State Department as Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor under President Barack Obama. He has also served as Washington Director for Human Rights Watch and Senior Director for National Security Council under President Bill Clinton.

Malinowski says he has been an outspoken advocate in Congress for combating political extremism and violence in the country, including anti-Semitism and the white supremacist groups responsible for most acts of terrorism in our country in recent years.
""I led a successful effort to restore funding the administration cut from the Department of Homeland Security to fight domestic terrorism and extremism, and have cosponsored a bipartisan resolution condemning QAnon,"" Malinowski said. ""While my opponent has endorsed President Trump for reelection and attended his rallies, I have always spoken clearly when the president crosses basic lines of decency and honesty, just as I do when I hear intolerant statements from people on my side of the political spectrum. In these difficult times for our country, I believe we need leaders willing to stand up and say what is right and wrong.""
Kean Jr. lists multiple issues including repairing the healthcare system, creating more jobs, protecting the environment, and improving infrastructure.
""I understand the importance of quality healthcare. I've been a leader on this issue in the New Jersey Senate, serving on both the Health and the Commerce committees. While there, I worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to find solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs, improve maternal healthcare and increase access to mental healthcare,"" Kean Jr. said.
Beginning his career working at the Environmental Protection Agency, this has always been an important issue to him.
""I have built a reputation as an advocate for clean energy and open space in the New Jersey state legislature. I have sponsored funding for offshore wind energy development and passed laws that ensure open space and conservation are well-funded. As a prime sponsor of the Global Warming Response Act in 2007, I have long understood the urgent nature of climate change,"" Kean Jr. said.

The county scanned 23,800 ballots out of the about 123,000 ballots submitted. The count already exceeds the total number of Somerset County mail-in ballots from the last presidential election counted by more than 10,000.
Ballots are allowed to begin to be counted on Oct. 28 after the New Jersey State Legislature passed a trio of election laws in August. Among those laws included allowing counties for the first time ever to begin the counting of ballots as early as 10 days before polls close to mitigate the large volume of paper ballots being mailed in due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The process for ensuring every voter who wants to vote can, and that every ballot counted is a valid ballot, is rigorous and detailed, but the Commissioners and I have worked hard to create a secure, seamless process,"" said Board of Elections Administrator Jerry Midgette. ""More than 100 county employees supported by National Guard members are working cooperatively to receive, verify, open, count, and secure every ballot to ensure a free and fair election.""
Somerset County Clerk Steve Peter says he expects around 180,000 ballots to be cast in total based on the ballots sent, more than 10,000 new voters registering since Labor Day, and the volume of ballots returned early.
In the 2016 presidential election, the State of New Jersey reported a total of 157,092 ballots cast, slightly more than 13,500 by mail-in-ballot.
""We've provided more than a quarter-million ballots to voters, and we are already seeing record turnout which will likely continue through next Tuesday,"" said Peter. ""We will continue to provide ballots and voter assistance at our office in Somerville for anyone who needs a replacement because of a misplaced, damaged, or improperly filled out ballot.""
For early ballot submission, voters can ballots can be dropped in the designated Drop Boxes throughout Somerset County.

The dropbox will be emptied each day by employees of Somerset County. Ballots must be received by the Board of Elections by the close of polls on Election Day at 8 p.m. Ballots that are postmarked by Nov. 3 can be counted if they are received no later than 8 p.m. on Nov. 9.

71,/new-jersey/hillsborough/congress-nears-new-stimulus-deal-what-it-means-new-jersey,2020-12-19T17:47:27Z,Congress Nears New Stimulus Deal: What It Means...,1,1,Alexis Tarrazi,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY— For months, members of Congress have dug in their heels, avoided concessions and failed to deliver a much-needed federal relief package aimed at helping cash-strapped Americans in New Jersey and others get through the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
Now, it appears negotiators in Washington, D.C., could finally be nearing an agreement.
For much of this week, members of Congress worked through the last remaining holdups on a long-delayed $900 billion COVID-19 economic relief package. At the center of the package would be billions in aid to small businesses, extended federal and state unemployment benefits, direct payments to Americans, and additional funds to renters and people needing food aid.
The package comes just as a new report confirms that nearly 8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since this summer, in part because emergency benefit programs expired. More Americans are filing for unemployment benefits, and the pace of hiring has slowed.
House leaders are eyeing Friday for a possible vote but negotiations could spill over into the weekend. Also Friday, a stopgap funding bill passed by Congress last week is set to expire. Congress must pass the new spending bill by midnight to avoid a federal government shutdown.
Should the coronavirus relief package pass both the House and Senate, here are five things it could do for people and businesses in New Jersey:
1) Send direct payments to people in New Jersey.
While initially not part of negotiations, direct payments were added to the package after negotiators failed to come to an agreement on aid for state and local governments. Striking that from the measure freed up $160 billion to be used for direct payments.
Currently, the package is expected to send one-time checks to millions of Americans below a certain income threshold. The amount will likely be between $600 and $700, The Washington Post reported.
Stimulus payments have received endorsements from President Donald Trump as well as progressives including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who remains dissatisfied about the overall package, according to The Associated Press.
The CARES Act passed in March provided for $1,200 payments per adult and $500 per child.
Additionally, the package is expected to defer federal student loan payments until April 2021, a policy that could impact about 40 million student loan borrowers.
2) Extend federal unemployment benefits for people out of work.
If approved, the relief package would include a $300-per-week bonus federal jobless benefit in addition to the renewal of soon-to-expire state benefits.
The CARES Act passed in March gave $600 per week to people who were out of work, on top of their usual state unemployment check. When this funding lapsed at the end of July, Trump signed an executive action to pay a $300-per-week bonus. That money will run out Dec. 31.
The need for additional unemployment aid was underscored Thursday by the release of weekly unemployment numbers — nationwide, 885,000 people applied for jobless benefits last week, the highest weekly total since September.
The new proposed unemployment aid would cover jobless Americans until April 2021.
In New Jersey, just over 17,000 new applications for unemployment were received by The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development during the week after Thanksgiving — which is a 26 percent rise from the prior week. In total, roughly 1.8 million New Jersey workers have sought jobless benefits since mid-March.
3) Renew an eviction ban for renters.
The new proposal would protect renters from evictions through Jan. 31, 2021. It would do this by providing $25 billion to state and local governments to pay for rent and utilities.
The CARES Act initially put in place a nationwide ban on evictions for renters who were late on rent. Trump extended the ban, but that extension, too, is set to expire at the end of the year — affecting just under 500,000 New Jersey claimants.
An eviction moratorium under the CARES Act expired on July 24. Moratoriums issued by FHFA, HUD, USDA and the VA were extended through at least Dec. 31. Additionally, the CDC issued an eviction moratorium on Sept. 4 that imposed a nation-wide residential eviction moratorium through Dec. 31. The CDC's eviction moratorium only prohibits evictions for non-payment of rent. Evictions for other reasons are not prohibited by the CDC eviction moratorium.
4) Provide aid to people in New Jersey who are hungry.
A report by Vox said the package will provide $13 billion to help fund a monthly 15 percent increase in individual SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits, aid for children who received food support at school, and money for other programs including Meals on Wheels and WIC (Women, Infants and Children).
Demand for such aid has spiked dramatically during the pandemic, Vox reports, with food banks across the country facing overwhelming need in recent months.
Nationwide, Feeding America predicts that 39 weeks of historic joblessness and business failures due to the coronavirus pandemic will likely leave as many as 50 million people nationwide without enough to eat.
New Jersey is not exempt from the hunger crisis facing our country.
According to Feeding America, 8.7 percent, or roughly 775,000 of New Jerseyians are food insecure.
5) Extend Paycheck Protection Program funding for small businesses in New Jersey.
The new proposal would add $300 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers business owners' forgivable loans as a way to help cover employees' wages instead of laying them off.
The Paycheck Protection Program is geared toward businesses with 300 or fewer employees that have seen a 30 percent or higher decrease in revenue in any quarter this year. A report by Fortune said almost 100,000 small businesses have already closed permanently during the pandemic.
In New Jersey, 155,851 businesses have received PPP funding. A total of more than $521 billion in loans from the program were distributed in New Jersey."

And starting Monday, all MVC Vehicle Centers will be open by appointment only. No walk-ins will be allowed.
A ""Vehicle Center"" processes registration transactions while a ""Licensing Center"" processes licensing transactions (see the list below).
All appointments are scheduled at NJMVC.gov. Appointments are added each day on a rolling 30-day basis.
""We've made tremendous progress in clearing the backlog of registrations for newly purchased used vehicles, which enables us to move fully to an appointment system in Vehicle Centers, reducing our capacity but increasing customer convenience,"" said Sue Fulton, chief administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission.
The Turnersville Vehicle Center was closed this weekend because of an employee testing positive for COVID-19 and will reopen Saturday, Dec. 26, the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission announced on Sunday.
The employee who tested positive was last in the Turnersville Center on Thursday.
Here are the 14 other MVC Centers are closed because of an employee testing positive for COVID-19 at each location, and they're scheduled to reopen on the following dates:
Appointments at Vehicle Centers for new titles/registrations, and registration renewals for customers ineligible for online renewal, are scheduled at NJMVC.gov. Recently, appointments were added at Vehicle Centers for duplicate or replacement titles.
Appointments during the hours 2-4 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays continue to be reserved for seniors. Eligible customers 65 years and older should look for the dedicated appointment option at NJMVC.gov.
At Trenton Regional/Vehicle Center, Regional services will continue to be available on a walk-in basis, but not regular vehicle transactions. Regional services include certain suspension and restoration services, officials said.
MVC Licensing Centers offer service by appointment for out-of-state transfers, in-person renewals, and driver knowledge tests. Licensing Centers offer walk-in service for a new license, non-driver ID, or permit.
The MVC has added more appointments at all locations for improved customer service.
""While the new surge of COVID-19 cases continues to impact our staffing, we will be adding more appointments every day to accommodate those whose appointments were canceled due to COVID quarantines,"" Fulton noted.
Any appointments that are canceled due to a COVID-19 closure must be rescheduled at the website. Customers are notified by email when their appointment has been canceled, officials said.
Customers should always log on to NJMVC.gov to check the status of locations before visiting any MVC facility.
Customers also can identify whether a transaction is available online, by appointment, or by walk-in using the new ""How do I…?"" Cheat Sheet in the Quick Links on the MVC home page.
