Every year, the department releases property tax statistics for each town and city in New Jersey, including Bloomfield. There were 565 municipalities on this year's list. Read More: See How Every NJ Towns Ranks For Property Taxes On New List
The average residential property tax in Bloomfield in 2021 was $11,064 for a home valued at $352,041. That's a $176 increase from 2020 – a difference of 1.6 percent.
Property taxes in New Jersey are made up of three parts: school, municipal and county. Here's how that broke down in Bloomfield last year:
As a state, New Jersey routinely ranks among the highest in the nation when it comes to property taxes. Last year, four of the seven counties with the highest median payments in the U.S. were located in New Jersey.
Taxes and home values have gone up steadily throughout the state over the past decade, regardless of what political party is in power. When former Gov. Chris Christie and the state Legislature reached a historic deal for a 2 percent cap in 2011, the average property tax bill in New Jersey was at $7,759 for a home valued at $299,014, not including credits or deductions. By the time Gov. Phil Murphy began his first term in 2018, the average property tax payment had risen by 13 percent.
The numbers have continued to rise during Murphy's tenure. According to the latest figures, the average property tax in New Jersey was $9,284 for a home valued at $335,623 in 2021, not including credits and deductions. Those numbers were up 1.9 percent from 2020, when they stood at $9,112 for a home valued at $330,578.

Every decade, the process of ""redistricting"" tweaks Congressional lines throughout New Jersey. And this year, the state's new map is shaking things up for several towns and cities – including Bloomfield.
The New Jersey Congressional Redistricting Commission recently released its new map of districts, which can be seen here. Read more about the process and purpose of redistricting here.

Nationally, employment rose by 199,000 jobs in December, and the unemployment rate dropped by 0.3 percentage points to 3.9 percent when seasonally adjusted, according to the BLS. The total number of jobs added was the lowest of any month in 2021; however, the BLS tends to revise job estimate figures upward in subsequent months.
The national unemployment rate dropped by 2.8 percentage points over the course of 2021 and continued to move closer to the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5 percent.
The latest available local unemployment figures are for November; that rate improved since October in the Bloomfield area and continues to be lower than it was after the pandemic first struck.
The Essex County unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in November, down from 7 percent in October. That reflected significant improvement from November 2020, when the unemployment rate stood at 12.5 percent.
The November unemployment rate in Essex County was higher than the New Jersey rate of 5.3 percent, according to the latest figures from the BLS.
Nationally, average hourly earnings increased by 19 cents per hour from November to December, up to $31.31, according to the BLS. Average hourly earnings increased 4.7 percent in 2021.
Some experts predict January and possibly February hiring will slow down due to the omicron coronavirus variant, according to The New York Times.
The leisure/hospitality industry continued to add jobs, with a net gain of 53,000 positions in December. Still, employment in the industry is down by 1.2 million positions, or 7.2 percent, since February 2020.

  BLOOMFIELD, NJ – Recently, the Bloomfield Fire Department took part in NATAL resilience training facilitated by Bloomfield firefighter Oscar Morales. NATAL was established in 1998 as a comprehensive trauma treatment and resiliency training organization in Israel, whose mission is to address the prevalent problem of psychological trauma related to terrorism and war. 
  ""The Bloomfield Fire Department has done an exceptional job at always being proactive and ensuring that its members always have the training and skills necessary to deal with whatever they may encounter,"" said Mayor Michael Venezia. ""NATAL is a tremendous resource for the men and women in our Fire Department that put their lives on the line to keep our community safe.""   Oscar Morales, a Bloomfield firefighter since September 2014, is a trained facilitator/instructor for NATAL: Israel Trauma & Resiliency Center UASI – Urban Area Security Initiative, New Jersey. He has been facilitating the resilience training over the past few weeks to help educate the department and his first responder peers on ways to deal with underlying stress and psychological trauma caused by responding to the emergencies within their community. The class is designed to help the first responders understand resilience and ways to implement positive coping strategies and tactics to deal with stress and trauma.   With multiple programs, 250 therapists, and 180 highly trained volunteers throughout the country, NATAL is an apolitical nonprofit organization. While NATAL's work began in Israel, its mission resonates worldwide. In recent years, NATAL has been called upon to deliver its expertise to at-risk communities and populations outside of Israel. As part of that, NATAL has led and participated in groundbreaking work to assist American wounded warriors dealing with PTSD, as well as providing first responder resilience training.   ""I would like to commend one of our own firefighters Oscar Morales for the work that he has done to teach valuable coping skills to our members through this groundbreaking program,"" said Chief Lou Venezia. ""Being a firefighter can be psychologically difficult and it is imperative that we have the necessary tools to deal with the potentially negative side effects that come with the territory.""
  This program is made possible through the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) program in order to enhance regional preparedness in major metropolitan areas. The UASI program provides funding to address the unique multi-discipline planning, operations, equipment, training and exercise needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas. UASI assists in building and sustaining capabilities related to terrorism prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.

Last week, Acting Attorney General Andrew Bruck released details about a series of new policies that he said will ""reinforce New Jersey's position as a national leader in the policing profession."" See full details about each below, and read a summary here.
They include:
The new policies have seen support from several law enforcement groups and community organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU-NJ), County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey (CPANJ), Latino Action Network (LAN), Muslim American Law Enforcement Association (MALEA), National Action Network (NAN), New Jersey Institute for Social Justice (NJISJ), New Jersey Muslim Officers Society (NJMOS), New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police (NJSACOP), New Jersey Women in Law Enforcement (NJWLE), National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), and State Troopers Fraternal Association (STFA).
The directives also picked up a thumbs-up from Gov. Phil Murphy, who called them a ""tremendous step forward.""
""They will build public trust and better reflect the diversity of the communities they protect and serve, underscoring our administration's commitment to transparency, racial equity, and justice in our policing practices,"" Murphy said.
Colonel Patrick Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, also supported the attorney general's new policies.
""As our country continues to evolve, New Jersey remains at the forefront of transparent policing by implementing policies that help reinforce the trust between law enforcement and our residents,"" Callahan said.
""New Jersey is a national leader on policing issues, and the three policies we are issuing today reaffirm our commitment to excellence,"" Bruck said. ""But what makes the Garden State special is that we develop policing policies collaboratively, by engaging law enforcement and community members alike, as we work to promote public trust and protect public safety.""
Bruck released the following details about each of the new directives.
AG Directive 2021-12: Regulating ""No-Knock"" Warrants - This directive provides common-sense regulations on both no-knock and knock-and-announce warrants that will promote officer and civilian safety.
Instructs law enforcement to take reasonable steps to identify the occupants of the premises to be searched, including any children or individuals with known vulnerabilities, prior to warrant execution.
AG Directive 2021-11: First Amendment Right to Observe, Object to, and Record Police Activity - In order to continue building better relationships between communities and police, this directive outlines as clearly as possible a bystander's right to observe, object to, and record police activity under the First Amendment, as well as its limitations.
AG Guidelines: Promoting Diversity in Law Enforcement Recruiting and Hiring - A 2020 law, N.J.S.A. 52:17B-4.10 (the ""Act""), directed the attorney general to develop guidelines to ensure the act's uniform application. The guidelines include the following:

9,/new-jersey/bloomfield/menendez-urges-biden-nix-student-loan-debt-deadline-looms,2021-12-08T20:08:12Z,Menendez Urges Biden To Nix Student Loan Debt...,0,1,Eric Kiefer,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY — U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez continues to call on President Joe Biden to ""cancel student loan debt."" And with a pandemic-inspired deferment period set to expire at the end of January, time is running out before more than a million people across New Jersey are again walloped by payments they can't afford, he says.
On Tuesday, Menendez – who has been a vocal supporter of nixing student loan debt for millions of Americans – repeated his plea to Biden, urging the president to cancel student loan debt up to $50,000.
According to Menendez, Biden wouldn't need Congress to make such a move happen if he uses his executive authority through the Higher Education Act of 1965.
The senator's renewed call to action comes as an emergency deferment period put in place in March 2020 approaches its expiration date: Jan. 31, 2022.
Menendez isn't alone. This week, groups including Public Citizen, the Student Debt Crisis Center and the Student Borrower Protection Center are hosting a ""Week of Action"" to push for federal student loan cancellation.
According to Lending Tree, there are an estimated 1.3 million borrowers in New Jersey holding $48.8 billion in public and private student loan debt, with an average balance of more than $33,000 or bills of $310 per month on average. More than 43 million Americans hold a combined $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt, with more than 9 million borrowers in default.
""For many New Jerseyans, particularly people of color, crippling student loan debt has turned the promise of a college education into a financial burden that plagues them for decades,"" Menendez said.
""That financial nightmare existed long before the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the deep disparities that exist for communities of color and low-income communities,"" he continued. ""For far too long, incomes have failed to keep pace with the rising cost not only of education but also health care, housing, child care, and other basic living expenses.""
""When you're barely keeping your head above water, it is nearly impossible to make a dent in your student loan principal,"" Menendez emphasized.
Some experts have criticized the drive to cancel student loan debt.
The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget recently argued that canceling student loan debt would be a poor stimulus to the economy. Researchers said that while student loan forgiveness would increase cash flow by $90 billion per year, it would come at a cost of $1.5 trillion.
""Simply extending the current executive action to defer loan repayments and cancel interest would achieve much of the economic benefit of loan cancellation at only a very small fraction of the cost,"" the committee's report states.
But according to Menendez, bolder moves are needed to level a playing field that's been unfair for far too long.
""Student loan forgiveness has the power to unleash a wave of consumer-driven growth in this country — and President Biden does not need Congress to do it,"" Menendez said. ""The time is now for the president to use his authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt. This relief would transform the lives of millions of Americans, especially poor, low-income and minority communities, narrow the racial wealth gap, and provide a much-need shot in the arm to our economy.""

The unemployment rate continued to move closer to pre-pandemic levels, but the number of new jobs reported was lower than expected.
Another 210,000 jobs were added to the economy in November, which was below the expectations of many economists. However, monthly job figures have been revised upward several times this year as data is updated. The BLS revised September and October job figures up by a combined 82,000 positions.
Meanwhile, the national unemployment rate dropped from 4.6 percent to 4.2 percent from October to November, according to the BLS. The pre-pandemic unemployment rate was 3.5 percent.
The most recently available local unemployment figures are for October; that rate improved since September in the Bloomfield area and continues to be lower than it was at the beginning of the pandemic.
The Essex County unemployment rate was 7 percent in October, down from 8.1 percent in September. That reflected some improvement from October 2020, when the unemployment rate stood at 9.3 percent.
The October unemployment rate in Essex County was also higher than the New Jersey rate of 5.5 percent, according to the latest figures from the BLS.
Nationally, the labor force participation rate — a measure of the employed share of the civilian population — increased by 0.2 percentage points to 61.8 percent. The increase was welcome news to economists, but the participation rate is still 1.5 percentage points lower than pre-pandemic levels.

This question was a no-brainer for former Green Party candidate for U.S. Senate, Ted Glick, 72, and his wife, Jane Califf, a pair of longtime activists from Bloomfield.
Glick and Califf were among more than a dozen seniors who were literally arrested in their rocking chairs during a rally in Wilmington, Delaware last June. Blocking a street in front of JP Morgan Chase credit card headquarters, the environmental advocates held a peaceful sit-in to demand that Chase Bank shift its investments in fossil fuels to renewable energy to ward off a ""full-blown climate crisis.""
The protest ended when the activists were arrested and given the equivalent of a traffic ticket.
After their arrest, court officials offered the activists a deal: pay a $10 fine and be done with the whole mess. Instead, they had another idea, Glick told Patch: a little-used legal defense known as the ""Choice of Evils.""
According to Glick, here's how the Delaware criminal code statute reads:
On Nov. 12, the self-described ""Rocking Chair Rebels"" headed to court to argue that they broke the law to prevent a greater harm from happening.
When the prosecutor – who was also the arresting officer – asked how the move justified the inconvenience to local drivers, the activists responded by testifying that there are already ""drastic, imminent harms"" occurring due to climate change, which are much worse for those drivers than a bad day in traffic.
In the end, the judge disagreed with the 11 activists who chose to go to trial, finding them guilty of disorderly conduct and imposing fines and court costs of $97. But that money bought something, Glick said: a rare chance to get some important environmental reports officially ""on the record.""
One example? A 50-page summary of the sixth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which The Guardian called the group's ""starkest warning yet"" about irreversible global climate changes.
They also submitted copies of the 2021 Banking on Climate Chaos report, which alleges that the world's 60 largest commercial and investment banks – including JPMorgan Chase – poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels from 2016–2020.
Glick emphasized that climate change is just as relevant to New Jersey residents as it is those in Delaware.
""I've been active in New Jersey opposing new fossil fuel projects in the state for about a decade,"" he said. ""People all over the country are doing the same things in their states. All of us have to contend with a federal government and mega-banks that have continued to allow and finance new such projects, digging the climate crisis hole we are in even deeper.""

On Monday, the Assembly Tourism, Gaming, and the Arts Committee approved a bill sponsored by Ralph Caputo of the 28th district. If it becomes law, the bill (A-6024) would provide $5 million in supplemental funding to the New Jersey Horse Racing Commission for horse racing purse subsidies, raising the current fiscal year total from $15 million to $20 million.
The 28th district includes Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Irvington, Newark and Nutley.
According to a statement from the assemblyman, ""because of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan and the increased revenue from our recovering economy,"" New Jersey will be able to add the supplemental funding and support the $20 million annual appropriation for racing purse subsidies established by the legislature in 2019.
The bill now heads to the Assembly speaker for further consideration.
Caputo, the committee's chair, said that horse racing is ""reemerging in New Jersey"" and reestablishing its pre-pandemic success.
""New Jersey's economy continues to recover and we now have federal funding to further support the industry's needs,"" Caputo said. ""With this measure, will be able to help our tracks conduct the races we enjoy and empower our horse racing industry so it can flourish.""

16,/new-jersey/bloomfield/every-nj-house-democrat-votes-yes-build-back-better-act,2021-11-19T17:22:23Z,Every NJ House Democrat Votes ‘Yes’ For Build...,1,60,Eric Kiefer,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY — Like nearly all of their peers across the nation, New Jersey's House of Representative members voted along party lines to narrowly pass President Joe Biden's $1.75 trillion ""Build Back Better Act"" on Friday.
In New Jersey, every Democratic member of the House voted for the Build Back Better Act, including Donald Norcross, Andy Kim, Josh Gottheimer, Frank Pallone, Tom Malinowski, Albio Sires, Bill Pascrell Jr., Donald Payne Jr., Mikie Sherrill and Bonnie Watson Coleman.
Meanwhile, the bill saw ""no"" votes from the state's two Republican House members, Jeff Van Drew and Chris Smith.
Van Drew and Smith voted to pass the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act last week, another pillar of Biden's domestic agenda. Both saw criticism from hardline conservatives over their votes.
If it passes the Senate and gets Biden's signature, the massive funding package would expand social services across the nation. It passed the House by a vote of 220-213.
The 2,100-page bill's initiatives include bolstering child care assistance, creating free preschool, curbing seniors' prescription drug costs and increasing efforts to slow climate change. Also included are tax credits to spur clean energy development, bolstered child care assistance and extended tax breaks for millions of families with children, lower-earning workers and people buying private health insurance.

As written, the bill would also restore most of the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), increasing the cap to $80,000 through 2030.
The Build Back Better Act now faces a tough challenge in the U.S. Senate, where cost-cutting demands seem certain to force significant changes.
Bob Hugin, chair of the New Jersey Republican Party, blasted the Build Back Better bill after its passage in the House, calling it ""one of the most irresponsible pieces of legislation our country has ever seen.""
""Under their watch, Democrats will have increased the combined federal and state tax rate on New Jersey businesses to the highest on planet Earth, while worsening the skyrocketing inflation that is already hurting New Jersey families at the grocery store and gas pump,"" Hugin claimed. ""New Jersey voters will hold them accountable for supporting Nancy Pelosi at the expense of New Jersey taxpayers.""
But several House Democrats said the bill is a big win for the Garden State, including its changes to the SALT deduction.
Reps. Pascrell, Gottheimer and Sherrill issued a joint statement about the potential boon to New Jersey homeowners:
Other New Jersey House Democrats praised the bill on Friday, saying it will make investments that have been put on the back burner for far too long.

Some progressives, however, say the bill is a good start – but a long battle remains ahead.
Imani Oakley, a 2022 Congressional candidate in New Jersey's 10th district, said the bill is only part of what the nation – and the state – needs to recover and rebuild.
""House moderates continuously watered-down important proposals to support corporate interests over the needs of working people,"" Oakley said. ""Now is not the time for half-measures.""
""We need transformative and just change to address the glaring problems the pandemic exposed,"" Oakley urged. ""We face an impending climate crisis, a housing affordability crisis, and a health care crisis. Democrats must rise to the occasion and not only pass the Build Back Better Act in the Senate, but continue to legislate transformatively with policies like a Green New Deal and Medicare for All.""
FOLLOWING THE MONEY
Biden and other Democratic leaders have said the measure would pay for itself, largely through tax increases on the wealthy, big corporations and companies doing business abroad.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the package would worsen federal deficits by $160 billion over the coming decade.
The nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) released a state-by-state analysis of the Build Back Better Act on Thursday. The group wrote:

On Monday, Assembly members Britnee Timberlake (District 34), Cleopatra Tucker (District 28) and Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (District 15) gave an update on the ""Community Wealth Preservation Program"" bill, which has been released from the Assembly Community Development and Affairs Committee.
The legislation now heads to now heads to the Assembly speaker for further consideration.
Timberlake represents Montclair, Orange, East Orange and Clifton. Tucker represents Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Irvington, Newark and Nutley.
According to a joint statement from the three lawmakers, the bill would reduce the loss of family wealth brought on by foreclosures and create equity in the purchase process for the people who actually live in a community – instead of those who just want to ""flip"" foreclosed homes.
Here's what the bill would do if it becomes law, according to Timberlake, Tucker and Reynolds-Jackson:
According to Timberlake, the legislation would also level the playing field for people who want to purchase an abandoned home to restore and live in for a minimum of seven years, instead of someone who wants to simply sell the home for profit.
The bill would require anyone who purchased property with financing to occupy the residence for an 84-month period and subject investors who misuse the program to flip properties to steep fines, the lawmakers said.
Timberlake said that New Jersey leads the country in housing foreclosures, many of which take place in urban areas of the state.
""Black and Brown wealth is hemorrhaging through the loss of foreclosed property, and the people who live in the community often do not have deep enough pockets to even participate in the foreclosure process,"" the assemblywoman said. ""This bill is a creative opportunity for families to save their wealth at the time of a foreclosure sale.""
Tucker said that the current process for buying foreclosed houses is stacked in favor of companies that have the money to purchase property at sheriff sales and resell it for a profit.
""By enacting the changes detailed in this bill, we can give people vested in the community a better chance of securing a home at these sales,"" Tucker said.
Reynolds-Jackson agreed with her peers.
""Making housing accessible and affordable is critical and the 'Community Wealth Preservation Program' can do that for many New Jerseyans who want to own a home and join a community,"" Reynolds-Jackson said. ""We know what barriers stand in the way of a homeowner's success at sheriff sales, and with this legislation, we can make a difference.""

U.S. senators Bob Menendez and Cory Booker have released a breakdown of how a massive infrastructure bill will benefit the Garden State. The bill – which every single New Jersey Congress member voted for – was signed by President Joe Biden on Monday.
All told, the bill will send billions of dollars to New Jersey to repair roads and bridges, expand mass transit, replace water and sewer pipes, and increase broadband internet access.
It will also have about $30 billion in funds to make improvements on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. That money will fuel construction of the Gateway Project, a highly anticipated plan to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River. Read More: Gateway Tunnel Back On Track Under Biden, NJ Governor Says
According to a joint statement from Menendez and Booker:
Here's how the funding will break down in New Jersey, the senators said:
MASS TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS (total of $4.15 billion)
BROADBAND INTERNET
Speaking at a news conference in Essex County, Menendez and Booker highlighted NJ Transit's ongoing modernization project at Bloomfield Station, which is part of the agency's $17 billion, five-year capital plan (watch the video above).
According to the senators, the proposed upgrades will increase accessibility for people with disabilities and provide safer access at the 109-year-old terminal, which served an average of 1,640 weekday riders before the pandemic – making it one of the busiest stations along the Montclair-Boonton Rail Line.
And that's exactly the type of progress the senators said they hope will take place across the state once the federal dollars start flowing New Jersey's way.
""When President Biden signs this legislation into law, we will begin unleashing transformative new investments in everything from roads and railways to drinking water to electrical vehicle infrastructure and more,"" Menendez said.
""NJ Transit is the largest statewide transit system in America and we're also home to the critical infrastructure that supports the busiest rail corridor in America – the Northeast Corridor,"" Menendez said. ""This legislation will provide access to billions of dollars over the coming years to complete major upgrades, like what's being proposed here in Bloomfield.""
Booker said the landmark funding package will also give the U.S. and New Jersey economies a boost by putting more people to work.
""As President Biden signs the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law today, New Jerseyans can expect to see billions of dollars for our state's infrastructure – from repairing roads and bridges, to replacing lead pipes and cleaning Superfund Sites, and advancing the Gateway Project,"" Booker added.

June 17, 2020
BLOOMFIELD, NJ -- Due to COVID-19 the Bloomfield Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department has been forced to make adjustments to planned activities. Following guidance from CDC and state officials, the department has released the following updated information regarding summer activities:
Independence Day Celebration
Bloomfield's annual Independence Day celebration scheduled for Saturday, July 4, at Foley Field has been postponed. The new date is tentatively scheduled for Saturday, September 12. It is the Parks Department's intention to provide entertainment, food, amusements and of course fireworks however, it must adhere to all state and local rules at the time of the scheduled event. More details will be released as it gets closer to the date.

Summer Camps & Sports Clinics
Following Governor Murphy's recent executive order allowing recreational summer camps to begin the second week of July, guidelines and requirements set forth by the Department of Children & Families, CDC and the NJ Department of Health are being reviewed. After review and subsequent discussion with surrounding communities it has been decided that the traditional full day indoor summer camp program will not be possible this summer.

With this in mind, its staff is working diligently on creating a combination of weekly sports clinics, in person classes and virtual programs during the summer. While full day child care cannot be provided, it is their goal to provide as many opportunities as they can for residents.
These programs are attentively set to begin on Monday, July 6 and run through August 7.

""I've lived 75 years as an African American. I spent my earliest years in the segregated South. I've served as a Marine in Vietnam and as a cop, councilman and deputy mayor in Newark. I've been a State Senator for 34 years. I am a son and brother. I am a husband and father. I am a grandfather. I am first and foremost a human being, flawed and imperfect, with my own fears to contend with.
""Today, I reflect on all the things that I am, and all the things I've seen. I do it in honor of George Floyd, in profound grief for him and thousands of others who have been killed by racism. I come to a full stop to honor George Floyd by putting every ounce of my concentration into how America can, once and for all, finally, put our knees on the neck of racism and smother the fear that fuels it.
""What I come to, is that we must – every one of us – sit in silence for a moment and picture our friends. See the faces of those we share laughs and life with. Picture lunchtime at work or school. Think about those we worship with. Consider the faces of people we relate best to in all the parts of our lives – at the gym or the park, on the bus or the elevator.
""If everyone in your sphere looks like you, you have discovered the first thing that needs to change. We can't treat others like ourselves unless we see ourselves in them. And we can't do that until we know them.
""Knowing brings understanding, and understanding brings love.
""We must start with invitations for inclusion. In the name of George Floyd and his family, I beg you to reach out to someone today who does not look like you. Walk over to them and start a conversation. Pick up the phone. Take the first step toward expanding your friends group.
""Do it again tomorrow. And the next day. And every day.
""It is not enough to forward a meme or to like a post, or to feel pity or sympathy for George Floyd and all the others who've been murdered. We must live a life of inclusion. We must open our hearts to each other and feel true empathy that results in the kind of tender compassion our nation needs so desperately.
""Legislation and policies and programs go a long way toward equality and justice but they can't take the place of love. Love is what will change us. And it has to start in my heart and yours.
""America has the capacity to change. Because it has us.""

On Friday, Gov. Phil Murphy announced his intention to nominate Fabiana Pierre-Louis to the New Jersey Supreme Court to fill the seat of Associate Justice Walter Timpone, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 later this year.
Currently a resident of Mount Laurel, Pierre-Louis was raised in Irvington for most of her childhood. Breaking racial barriers isn't a new experience for the Rutgers Law School graduate, who was the first woman of color to serve as the attorney-in-charge of the United States Attorney's Offices for the District of New Jersey in Camden and Trenton.
It's a much-welcomed – and long overdue – move for the state, according to Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver.
""Across this country, there are 33 states which do not have a woman of color on their highest court,"" Oliver said. ""I cannot wait to see New Jersey leave that list with Fabiana's confirmation to the Supreme Court.""
There are a few hurdles remaining, according to a statement from the New Jersey Governor's Office:
However, upon confirmation by the state Senate, Pierre-Louis would be the first black woman to serve on the state's highest court, the governor's office stated.
""It is extremely humbling to have the opportunity to continue the proud tradition of the New Jersey Supreme Court's commitment to justice, equality and fairness,"" Pierre-Louis said.
Murphy praised Pierre-Louis' ""esteemed legal career, humility, empathy and character.""
""As a first-generation American, Fabiana brings both a sharp legal acumen and the perspective of her own past that will greatly benefit the proceedings of our state's highest court,"" Murphy said.

The Bloomfield Division of Public Safety issued the following statement on Sunday.
""Last night, members of the Bloomfield Police Department along with several other agencies responded to Newark to assist with the protest over the appalling death of George Floyd.
""The actions and force used by the Minneapolis Police Officers in the video are absolutely inexcusable and unacceptable. These officers must be held accountable for not only their actions, but inactions, that were inconsistent with any training and procedures of our profession.
""Today, the Township of Bloomfield experienced a very peaceful, productive protest. We as a department welcome everyone's right to express themselves, with the understanding that these protests are done peacefully and within the parameters of the law without damaging property, harming citizens, or our police. Please know that The Bloomfield Police Department will always support all people; regardless of race, sex, religion, or beliefs.
""Incidents like this undermine efforts of law enforcement all over to build community relationships and trust with those we have sworn to serve and protect. The actions of these officers should not discredit the millions of other men and women who wear a badge.
""The Bloomfield Police Department offers our utmost condolences to George Floyd's family during this unimaginable time.""
'BRUTALLY MURDERED'
U.S. Rep. Donald Payne Jr. of New Jersey's 10th District said that Floyd was ""brutally murdered."" While Chauvin has since been arrested, the congressman also called for Minneapolis authorities to file charges against the other three police officers who participated in the incident.

July 9, 2020
BLOOMFIELD, NJ -- In an effort to make parking safer and increase the number of available spots, the township has begun an angled parking pilot study. The study will last for six months and if successful, the angled spots will become permanent.
""We are always searching for better ways to provide parking, especially in our main shopping area,"" said Mayor Michael Venezia. ""We have seen in other communities that reverse angle parking provides a safer way to access a vehicle and exit a parking spot. One of the most important features that I saw with this new way of parking is that it's easier and safer for parents with little children.""
The parking method takes some practice and we will be assisting our residents with getting in and out of those spots,"" said Township Administrator Mathew Watkins. ""We will have a parking attendant at the location to assist and we have erected new signs with the hope that the benefit will pay off after the trial period.""
In this video, Bloomfield Police Lieutenant Naomi Zepeda demonstrates how to properly pull into the new angled spots. Drivers must pull in front of the spot they wish to park in, put their blinker on to indicate they are going to park and then carefully back into the parking space.
In a township traffic study conducted by traffic engineers, it was determined that by adding angled parking to this area, it would increase safety and open up additional parking spots. With this method of parking, car doors would no longer open towards traffic and getting out of a space will be much easier because the driver would be facing oncoming traffic. If the trial period proves successful, the township will look to expand this type of parking into other areas.

That...,1,0,Eric Kiefer,Patch Staff,"ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — An Irvington native and Rutgers Law School graduate with a history of breaking racial barriers has taken another step toward a landmark appointment on the New Jersey Supreme Court.
On Monday, the state Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously confirmed the nomination of Fabiana Pierre-Louis. If approved by the full Senate, Pierre-Louis, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, would become the first Black woman to serve on the highest court in New Jersey.
There are currently no Black judges sitting on the court.
Pierre-Louis, 39, a Mount Laurel resident, was raised in Irvington for most of her childhood.
Gov. Phil Murphy nominated Pierre-Louis to the post in June. She would fill the seat of Associate Justice Walter Timpone, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 later this year.
According to the governor's office:
Her connections to the law school community run deep, the governor's office added:
Sen. Nicholas Scutari, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the nomination was ""clearly historic"" and that the Irvington native will be able to bring a different set of life experiences and a ""greater diversity of opinions"" to the state's highest court.
But he emphasized that Pierre-Louis earned the nod because of her credentials and qualifications, which he said speak for themselves.
""She could be serving for more than 30 years with the responsibility of passing judgment on significant issues that could impact the lives of generations of New Jersey residents,"" Scutari said.

The nomination of Pierre-Louis has gained support from Democratic and Republican party members.
Sen. Chris Brown, a Republican from the state's 2nd District, offered a thumbs-up for Pierre-Louis in June, calling her a ""role model"" for the American Dream.
Brown wrote:
Senate President Steve Sweeney of the state's 3rd District also lent support to Pierre-Louis' nomination.
Sweeney, a Democrat, said she would be able to have a ""real-life impact"" on generations of New Jersey residents.
""Pierre-Louis is an American story of success who will bring a perspective gained by her personal and legal experiences to the state's highest court,"" Sweeney said.
Pierre-Louis got a glowing endorsement from the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA), which pointed out that she would also be the first Haitian American to serve on the court.
HNBA President Irene Oria wrote:
Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver has also been a supporter of Pierre-Louis. After her initial nomination, Oliver — who was born and raised in Newark and has broken racial barriers herself — said it was a much-needed sign of progress in a time of public outrage.
""Across this country, there are 33 states which do not have a woman of color on their highest court,"" Oliver stated. ""I cannot wait to see New Jersey leave that list with Fabiana's confirmation to the Supreme Court.""
""As the first Black woman elected to serve in statewide office in New Jersey, I see every day how important that kind of representation is,"" Oliver continued. ""When I speak to young African American boys and girls and tell them my story in public service, I see their faces light up when they realize that if I could do it, they can, too. Fabiana's nomination sends the same message, and I look forward to watching her ascend to the top judicial body in our state.""

Pulaski Park is one of many phenomenal outdoor spaces in our township that all residents should take advantage of.""
In addition to a fully ADA compliant turnabout spinner/merry-go-round, this playground features a ""Quiet Grove"" for children who can become overstimulated on a playground. The Quiet Grove combines the soothing benefits of nature with sensory activities to help children alleviate stress and escape from the hustle and bustle of the playground activity.
""During the design phase it was important to me to work with our representative to design a playground that was inviting, vibrant, spacious and inclusive,"" said Michael Sceurman, Director of Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs. ""I couldn't be happier with the final product and by receiving a platinum designation by Little Tikes Commercial Play Systems and Unlimited Play it validates our commitment to inclusive play.""
Pulaski Park is located at 24 Mt. Vernon Avenue and other features of the park include, four basketball rims, four lighted tennis courts, a hand ball court, lighted softball field, community garden, bike racks and a 60 spot parking lot.
On Saturday, August 1 all municipal tot lot playgrounds reopened to the public and will be disinfected daily by the DPW and Park Maintenance Department to ensure that the equipment on the playgrounds is cleaned and children can enjoy themselves once again in our extraordinary municipal park system.

Posted on: August 3, 2020
BLOOMFIELD, NJ -- In a continued effort to honor and preserve the historic character of Bloomfield, the Mayor, Town Council and Historic Preservation Commission are beginning a survey of historic resources in the township. The survey, which has been contracted to Richard Grubb and Associates (RGA), will identify properties that have a significant architectural, cultural and historic value that can be designated as local historic sites.
""Protecting the historic charm of our incredible community while proactively searching for additional properties that we can protect is something that the Council and myself have prioritized,"" said Mayor Venezia. ""It is my hope that this survey will identify properties that we can add to our inventory of historic sites which is already very robust. I am grateful for the hard work that the Historic Preservation Commission puts in to make all of this possible.""
Through the Summer and Fall, residents may see RGA staff in their neighborhood photographing properties from the sidewalk or public right-of-way to gather information to include in the field survey. All RGA vehicles are marked with the RGA logo and RGA staff will not enter private property without permission. The findings of the survey will be made available to the public at the completion of the survey.
""I've always been impressed with how much pride Bloomfield residents have in the historic character of our town,"" said Councilman and Liaison to the Historic Preservation Commission Rich Rockwell. ""We're fortunate to have a historic district that has been on the state and national registers of historic sites since 1978, but we also have many properties outside the Historic District that are worthy of recognition and preservation. We're excited to be surveying other areas of town for sites to be added to our historic inventory to give them the recognition and protection they deserve. As Liaison to the Historic Preservation Commission, I'm proud to be spearheading this survey.""
If you have any questions about the survey, or if you wish to share information about the history of your property, please contact Bonnie Flynn, Planning Director via email or 973-680-4192.

NJ May Make It...,1,19,Eric Kiefer,Patch Staff,"ESSEX COUNTY, NJ — A proposed New Jersey law would make it a crime if people refuse to wear a face mask in stores during the coronavirus crisis. Penalties would range up to a $500 fine and 30 days in jail.
Earlier this week, state Assembly members Ralph Caputo (District 28) and Valerie Vainieri Huttle (District 37) introduced a bill that gives new teeth to Gov. Phil Murphy's order to wear masks when shopping indoors.
If passed into law, A-4453 would make it illegal for someone without a mask to enter any store that has a sign posted about mask requirements. The law would treat the crime as a petty disorderly persons offense. It would take effect immediately and would remain in effect for the duration of the state of emergency declared in Executive Order No. 103.
The bill has been referred to the Assembly Judiciary Committee.
""We need to look at the facts based on what we know right now, which is that wearing a mask around other people — especially indoors — significantly reduces the spread of this deadly virus,"" said Caputo, who represents Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Irvington, Newark and Nutley.
""This is truly a matter of life and death which we cannot take lightly,"" Caputo urged. ""Although many residents have been following [Gov. Phil Murphy's] mask mandate, those who aren't put us all at risk.""
There needs to be some sort of penalty to drive home the point that the mandate isn't optional, he added.
""One way or another, we're all in this pandemic together, and must all do our part to prevent the spread of this virus,"" Caputo said.
Vainieri Huttle said that masking up in stores is a ""critical"" step to protect business owners, staff and customers in the pandemic.
""Wearing a mask is a show of respect for the health of others around you as well as the sacrifices that have been made during this difficult time,"" she said. ""I believe that this legislation is an important step in ensuring that New Jersey continues on the right track towards recovery.""
Vainieri Huttle represents Alpine, Bogota, Cresskill, Englewood, Englewood Cliffs, Fort Lee, Hackensack, Leonia, Northvale, Palisades Park, Rockleigh, Teaneck and Tenafly.

A limited number of polling places will be open on Nov. 3, the same day that mail-in ballots must be postmarked in order to be counted. READ MORE: NJ 2020 Election Guide: How To Vote, Who's On The Ballot
Here's what's at stake in Bloomfield.

Residents of Bloomfield will also get a chance to pick members of the newly named Essex County Board of County Commissioners, formerly known as the ""freeholders."" All nine seats on the board are up for grabs this year. Each term lasts three years.
In another county-level race, incumbent Christopher Durkin, the Democratic Party nominee, will defend his position as Essex County clerk against Kristina Christoforou, who earned the Republican Party nomination in the July primary election.
NATIONAL, STATE

MORE ELECTION INFO
The last day to register to vote for the general election was Oct. 13. This year, every voter was mailed a ballot that they can fill out and mail back. Because of possible delays in U.S. Postal Service deliveries, election advocates advised people to send them back no later than Oct. 22. Mail-in ballots must bear a postmark on or before Nov. 3, or they won't be counted.
Essex County residents who are concerned about the security of their mail-in ballots may find some solace via a local ""drop box"" that has been put up for the 2020 general election. See a list of drop box locations in Essex County here.
A limited number of in-person polling places will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 3. ADA-compliant machines will be available for those who need assistance. All other voters will be given a provisional ballot. Find your local polling place here.

66,/new-jersey/bloomfield/trump-so-bad-it-made-me-stop-eating-nj-man-hunger-strike,2020-10-13T16:22:43Z,Trump Is So Bad It Made Me Stop Eating: NJ Man...,0,3,Eric Kiefer,Patch Staff,"BLOOMFIELD, NJ — The 2020 election is giving people stomachaches across the United States. But a longtime activist in New Jersey has embarked on a gastronomical challenge of a different sort in his quest to help defeat President Donald Trump.
He's refusing to eat until the election is over.
Ted Glick, 71, of Bloomfield, launched his ""Fast to Defeat Trump"" on Oct. 3. He plans to stay in his home until Nov. 3 with his wife and fellow activist, Jane Califf, consuming only water and vitamins for the 30-day period.
Here's why Glick launched his hunger strike:
Glick said he's also trying to encourage people who will be voting for former Vice President Joe Biden to sign up with one of the groups working to motivate and turn out voters, especially in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Georgia and Texas.
Glick, a former Green Party candidate for U.S. Senate, is no stranger to hunger strikes. His first politically inspired fast – a push to end the Vietnam War – lasted for 40 days in the summer of 1972. In 1992, he fasted for 42 days to protest planned government celebrations of Christopher Columbus' quincentennial. And in 2007, Glick stopped eating for 25 days to demand climate action.
It's not for the faint of heart – or gut, he says.
So far, Glick said that he's lost 17 pounds. He's also reported feeling ""persistent weakness"" since the second day of his campaign.
""Fasting comes with health risks, and shouldn't be undertaken lightly, especially in the [coronavirus] pandemic,"" Glick wrote in a statement to the media on Monday.
Glick urged any supporters not to join him. Instead, they should ""go all out"" and work to defeat Trump over the next three weeks. And that includes his fellow third-party and independent voters, he added.
""The Biden-Harris campaign needs the organizing experience and commitment of Green Party members and other progressive independents right now,"" he said.
Glick's activist resume conjures the spirit of the 1960s, the decade when he left college to fight against the Vietnam War. It wasn't long before he'd spent 11 months in prison as a Selective Service draft resister.
Since first taking up the call for social justice, Glick has fought against climate change in New York and New Jersey, battled for tenant rights and racial justice in Brooklyn, and helped to organize protests involving thousands of people in the South Bronx, at Madison Square Garden and in Washington D.C.
He's also been arrested 25 times for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience, 11 of which took place after October 2006.
In his home region of Essex County, Glick has been a driving force with Roseland Against The Compressor Station, a grassroots group that's fought against the expansion of a natural gas facility.
Last year, he was arrested along with a fellow activist after a group of people staged a protest at the Williams/Transco natural gas compressor station on Eagle Rock Avenue, linking arms and temporarily blocking construction equipment from moving onto the site.
Glick also authored an inspiring message about race relations in the wake of George Floyd's death earlier this year.
While riding his bike in Nutley – just a day removed from attending a massive protest in Newark – Glick said he started seeing Black Lives Matter messages on the pavement. Then he started seeing young people, teenagers, mainly women and mainly white, stretching out for what became a quarter of a mile, chalking dozens of messages.
He recalled:
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO FAST?
Glick has been documenting his latest fast on his website. Here's where his mind has wandered since the hunger strike began.
Oct. 3 – ""It's now been 14 hours as I write since I had anything to eat, at a wonderful outdoor meal with Jane and close friends last evening, and I'm already feeling different. One thing I'm doing differently is yawning even though I had a good night's sleep and have only been up for a few hours. It has to be related to my not drinking any coffee. I've usually had half a cup by now, and in general I drink at least that much on a normal day. I'm also feeling it a little bit in my stomach, a very slight discomfort, like it's telling me, 'time for some nourishment, what's the problem?' Based on past experience I expect it'll be three to four or so days before this feeling and hunger pangs go away. I'm already looking forward to that next stage, the stage when the body's craving for food has abated and I get onto a different plane, physically and psychologically. I hope, and expect, that because I ordinarily eat in a healthy way, lots of organic food, for example, I shouldn't experience headaches or other discomfort caused by the body feeding on toxins and chemicals. We'll see.""
Oct. 4 – ""I'm doing OK physically, no real problems. But there are times when I long for food, times I need to remember why I am doing this, why it is so essential that President Chaos and many of his accomplices are removed from office, why this next 30 days and what happens on November 3 is so, so important. It takes literally seconds for me to shake off that food longing and get refocused. We'll see how that goes going forward.""
Oct. 5 – ""How do I feel? Weaker, no question. I can feel my stomach shrinking/crying out for food. I'm getting a little spacey, though I can definitely focus and do light work, like at the computer, and expect to be able to do so for most of the fast.""
Oct. 6 – ""I'm feeling OK. My stomach feels like it's getting used to the new reality. I was pleased that yesterday I took part in a small demonstration in the town of Roseland in opposition to the fracked gas compressor station there and in support of a rapid shift from fossil fuels to wind and solar. I stood with others for an hour and a half holding signs, and a lot of the cars which went by honked, waved or gave us a thumbs up. I don't plan on going to other demonstrations for the duration of the fast, need to conserve my energy, but going to this one on day three seemed like an OK thing to do.""
Oct. 9 – ""I am feeling my 71-year-old age. During my last, long water-only fast of 25 days, in 2007, I definitely had more energy and was more active over the course of it. How do I keep doing it? It's easy; I just need to think of monster Donald Trump staying in the White House for four more years.""
Oct. 10 – ""I decided this morning that I'm going to schedule an appointment with our family doctor for the end of the week, which will be about the halfway point of the fast. Friends have been urging me to do this since I announced the fast. I'm not doing so because there's anything new happening with me. The main fast ""symptom"" is weakness and loss of energy, nothing else. But the thought of 24 more days feeling like this isn't a happy thought, so it does make sense for me to be checked out by a doctor I trust.""
Oct. 12 – ""My relationship to food on this fast, in part because I'm doing it at home, is not what most people would expect. Although I'm not eating, that doesn't prevent me from smelling foods with a pleasing smell, which I do quite often. More than that, I have found myself making soups, salads and main dishes for wife Jane, and enjoying the experience. I enjoy working with the food, I enjoy making something that tastes good (according to Jane) and I am glad to be doing more than my usual share of cooking to give Jane more time to do other things. It feels very right. I almost never feel a strong urge to cheat and eat. My mind is very locked in, and has been for nine months, on my belief that this is the right action at the right time for me to be doing. I guess it's a form of mind over matter, belief over usual human nature.""

Donald Payne Jr. of New Jersey's 10th District was one of several elected officials to earn a perfect score this year from the Human Rights Campaign for his voting record on LGBTQ-related issues.
The Human Rights Campaign released its 2020 Congressional Scorecard earlier this month. Members of Congress were scored based on a range of key indicators of support — from votes in the House to pass pro-equality legislation like the Equality Act to votes in the Senate to confirm anti-LGBTQ Trump-Pence cabinet officials and judicial nominees, as well as co-sponsorships in both chambers on pieces of legislation that significantly impact LGBTQ people and their families.
Payne was among the congress members in New Jersey who scored a ""100"" this year. The only House members to not get a perfect score were Republicans: Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who scored a 78, and Rep. Chris Smith, who scored a 17.
Payne is up for re-election this November. He's running against Jennifer Zinone of the Republican Party, John Mirrione of the Libertarian Party and independent candidates Akil Khalfani and Khaliah Fitchette.
New Jersey's 10th Congressional District covers portions of Essex, Hudson and Union counties, including the following municipalities: Bloomfield, East Orange, Glen Ridge, Irvington, Maplewood, Montclair, Newark, Orange, South Orange, West Orange, Bayonne, Jersey City, Hillside, Linden, Rahway, Roselle, Roselle Park and Union Township.
