Fellow leaders and local officials began offering their condolences on Saturday.
Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard commended his leadership and how he positioned Oakland County.
""Today, is the end of an era in Oakland County,"" Bouchard said in a statement. ""Brooks Patterson was a steadfast leader, who safeguarded Oakland County's fiscal stability in good times and in bad. His policies and focus in leading this county into the 21st century will never be forgotten.

Whether you agreed with him on an issue or not, you always knew his unwavering concern had the best interests of Oakland County – first and always.""
""He devoted his whole adult life to Oakland County. I knew him as Oakland County Prosecutor while I was a patrol officer and as the executive while I have been the Sheriff. In both roles, I was appreciative of his dedication to public safety and investing in law enforcement advancements for our communities. His ability to make wise financial and policy decisions for the residents of Oakland County will have a lasting impact on all of us for years to come. He will be greatly missed. His family and loved ones are in my prayers.""

This has been a long hard year of losses of giants for this state.""

The work began Dec. 6 and has a new design city officials say will better serve citizens.
Here's what you need to know about the massive project:
The new city hall comes with lots of advantages
The city says the new city hall will offer better navigation with a customer-friendly first floor, more and larger meeting spaces for higher participation from residents, it will be energy efficient to save money and protect the planet and will have modern technology like online applications at user-friendly kiosks. The new building will also be accessible to all, including those using wheelchairs or strollers.
Alternate parking is available
During construction, 186-parking spaces will be taken offline to make room for materials and equipment. The city has put together a guide to help visitors navigate alternative parking spaces in the vicinity. The guide can be downloaded at www.rethinkro.com. A brand new parking garage one block west of the construction site is scheduled to bring 581 parking spaces to the area in June 2019.
The farmers market is open for business
The Royal Oak Farmers Market will remain open during the construction. Market officials have been working on solutions to make the market user-friendly during the construction, including offering free valet parking and shopping carts.
Read more about the new valet service here.
The cityscape is changing
Once the new City Hall and police station (tentatively scheduled to begin construction in January) are completed, the old buildings will be torn down. Built nearly seven decades ago, these buildings were not designed for the kinds of uses the city needs today and in the future. The work required to renovate and fix numerous problems would be too extensive and expensive to repair, according to a study commissioned from Plante Moran CRESA.
A new downtown park will be built in its place.

Cities around Michigan are currently weighing in on the marijuana business. Dearborn's city council has taken up the issue and will vote on whether they want to opt out of proposal 1 Dec. 4.
Royal Oak now joins several other municipalities which have voted against letting the industry in, including Pinckney and Niles.
St. Joseph is also considering an opt-out, the Associated Press reported.
Royal Oak's City Commissioners had mixed views about passing the ordinance in a 4-3 vote this week to ban marijuana facilities, according to the Daily Tribune. The city plans to w explore the potential impact of such businesses in the city.
Three-fourths of Royal Oak residents reportedly voted in favor of proposal 1, which will allow adults 21 and older to use marijuana recreationally. The law is expected to take effect on Dec. 6, but businesses would not be opened until 2020.
A next possible move for Royal Oak is to have a town hall meeting on the matter with its residents.

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.

What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
The State government should continue to fight for additional Federal funding to support our local businesses economic hardships.

There are also plenty of volunteer opportunities for those community members who want to ""give back"" and make a difference in their cities.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
As an active Royal Oak Multicultural Parents Association member, I will continue to collaborate with our members and work on improving a collaborative relationship with our School Board.

What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
There are 4 open school board positions and 6 candidates and I believe the best way for voters to know who we are and what we stand for is to watch the School Board forums presented by ROMPA and the Greater Royal Oak Democratic Club.

Age: 44
Party affiliation: N/A
Family:My husband Don and I have been married for 21 years. We have an 11 year old daughter who has started Middle School this year.
Occupation:I hold a Masters Degree in Counseling from Oakland University and I have been working in the non-profit world for the past 21 years. The past 20 years have been spent at Oakland Family Services where I currently serve as the Director of Quality Assurance. Over the years I have provided individual and group therapy sessions for adults and adolescents with mental health and substance use disorder diagnoses. I have also supervised programs including budget development/management and clinical supervision. I serve on the agency's race and equity task force.
Previous elected experience:No formal government experience. I have served as President of our Homeowners Association for the past 3 years.
Family members in government:No.
Campaign website: http://www.AlexanderforSchoolBoard.com
The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
In a time like we are in it feels impossible to narrow down one single issue facing our state. However one area that I feel I can contribute to as part of my campaign is that of racism or racial inequity. It is imperative that I listen to the voices of the community members, students and teachers when they express their thoughts and feelings on racism and racial inequities within the school district. We must amplify the voices and weave that into the Board's consciousness so that it becomes a consideration in every decision and action taken.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Not all candidates have children in the district, have experience with budget development /management or board experience. I have all three.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have experience in development and execution of annual budgets in excess of a 3 million dollars. I am familiar with working collaboratively with individuals from different backgrounds, with differing experience and opinions. Listening can be one of the most important tools and my professional experience has taught me how to be an active listener with the goal of helping solve problems.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
The state government should continue to utilize the CARES act monies to help support small businesses. It should also continue to request assistance from the federal government when needed. The balance between health and safety and the impact on small businesses cannot be ignored.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
Our city, like those around the country, is experiencing the calls for racial justice and police reform. One of the most important things for any elected official to do is to listen to the voices of the stakeholders. I intend to elevate the voices of all stakeholders and ensure that voices are being considered within decision making, policies and procedures. It's important for us to consider that just because something hasn't happened to us, doesn't mean that it hasn't happened and doesn't mean that it is important for change to occur.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
Equity and diversity are key components of my campaign. I want to work to ensure there is diversity among teaching professionals, diversity in curriculum and equity for all students with a focus on black and brown students and those students needing special education or other accommodations. There should be equity in discipline practices across racial and ethnic groups and these statistics should be transparent and available for review by the community.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I love the city of Royal Oak and I want our schools to be world class. As a product of public education my husband and I chose Royal Oak for our home in part due to the quality of their school system. I want to ensure that world class education be available to all Royal Oak students and their families."

By C.J. Moore - October 16, 2020
With T-minus 18 days until the Nov. 3 general election, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden headed to Michigan Friday for two events.
He was joined by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing) in Southfield, a suburb of Detroit. Peters, who is running for reelection to the U.S. Senate against Republican John James, has not appeared at previous Biden events.
Whitmer, a co-chair of his campaign, and Peters both gave short remarks on preserving the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the 2011 Obama-era law that reformed the health insurance system.
President Donald Trump's administration and Republicans in Congress have sought to repeal the law and back a lawsuit before the U.S. Supreme Court. Biden has campaigned on safeguarding and expanding the ACA.
""Our choice couldn't be more clear. While Joe Biden works to expand health care in the midst of a global pandemic that killed more than 218,000 Americans — nearly 7,000 of whom are Michiganders — the Trump administration keeps working to fight to take that health care away instead of keeping people safe and delivering on federal relief,"" Whitmer said.
Michigan reported a spike of 2,015 new COVID-19 cases on Friday. Nearly 7,000 Michigan residents have died from the disease.
""Ask yourself this: Which candidate can get the COVID-19 crisis under control?"" Whitmer added. ""Which man is going to get us back to work? Who could bring us together as a nation?""
Biden took to the podium to briefly speak in support of Peters, who is facing a close race against James.
""Folks, we need to send Gary back for another term standing up for Michigan families and small businesses,"" Biden said.
Biden also used a portion of his remarks to wish Whitmer well, after it was revealed in recent weeks that she had been the target of a since-thwarted, anti-government terrorist plot to kidnap and murder her.
""Jill [Biden] and I are so grateful that the governor and her family are safe,"" Biden said. ""Governor, you've been through a lot, but my Lord, you are a leader. You stand up straight and tall and you don't bend.""
There's not a better governor in American than Whitmer, Biden added. He flat-out denounced those accused of threatening her as ""domestic terrorists.""
He then moved on to the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case on it Nov. 10 and Democrats have raised concerns about Trump's nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, who has criticized the law and is expected to be confirmed soon by the GOP Senate.
Biden has campaigned on lowering insurance premiums, protecting people with pre-existing conditions and expanding the ACA to offer people a public insurance plan option like Medicare.
""If Trump gets his way, 20 million more Americans will lose their health care in the midst of this god-awful economic crisis,"" Biden said, citing loss estimates that are similar to reports from the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress.
About 827,000 Michigan residents could lose health coverage if the ACA is overturned, according to a June report from the think tank.
Biden is headed to an event urging absentee voting in Detroit. This was Biden's third visit to Michigan in the last two months. He last paid a visit to Grand Rapids on Oct. 2.
Trump is slated to do a rally in Muskegon Saturday. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Grand Rapids Wednesday."

Oakland Community Health Network (OCHN) promotes National Family Caregiver Month in November. This national observance pays tribute to the essential role family members play in ensuring the health and well-being of those most in need. Throughout this month and the year, it is important to acknowledge those who spend their days caring for others and support them in continuing to carry on with this important work.
""OCHN is proud to acknowledge and celebrate National Family Caregiver Month in November,"" said OCHN Executive Director and CEO, Dana Lasenby. ""The dedication and compassion of these individuals deserves our unending support and gratitude for the selfless acts they perform every day.""
Caregivers spend countless hours, energy, and resources in providing a vital lifeline to loved ones. This role is especially challenging during these difficult and uncertain times. The Caregiver Action Network (CAN) suggests the following self-care tips for family caregivers:
• Seek support from other caregivers
• Take care of your own health so you can be strong to take care of your loved one
• Accept offers of help and suggest specific things people can do to help you
• Learn how to communicate effectively with health care providers
• Take respite breaks often
• Watch for signs of depression and don't delay getting professional help when you need it
• Be open to new technologies that can help you care for your loved one
• Organize medical information so it's up to date and easy to find
• Make sure legal documents are in order
• Give yourself credit for doing the best you can
During this time of National Family Caregiver Month and anytime throughout the year, give recognition and support those who devote themselves to their loved ones in this role. To learn more, visit the Caregiver Action Network www.caregiveraction.org"
