With all 25 participating precincts reporting, the ""yes"" votes narrowly surpassed the ""no"" votes by a margin of 5,215 to 4,834.
2. Do you favor an amendment to the Lakeland City Charter that reduces the maximum allowable terms of city commissioners and mayor from 4 terms to 3; defining a term as any service in office over 2 years; allowing existing incumbent commissioners to serve a total of 4 terms as commissioner and mayor combined?
With all 25 participating precincts reporting, the ""yes"" votes surpassed the ""no"" votes by 6,609 votes to 3,497 votes.
3. Do you favor an amendment to the Lakeland City Charter that changes the approval necessary to sell any water plant or electric utility from the existing requirement of 2/3 of all electors qualified to vote to 2/3 vote of the City Commission and 65% of those actually voting in the next general election following City Commission approval?

This year's event kicks off with a Freedom Walk — a way to symbolically honor the ""dedication and sacrifices"" that first responders make every day.
""The Freedom Walk will be led by the Winter Haven High School Army ROTC honor
guard along with a bagpipe playing as the walkers wind through downtown Winter
Haven,"" organizers explained.
A boot display will honor each Polk County first responder who has perished in
the line of duty.
""This includes law enforcement, fire/EMT as well as military,"" said organizers. Students from Winter Haven Christian School will provide music and a special dramatic reading.
Local Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts will lead the Pledge of
Allegiance while a multi-agency honor guard presents the colors. Law
enforcement agencies from across the county will be represented with displays.
The event is sponsored by the Winter Haven Police Department with assistance from the Winter Haven Fire Department.
""All law enforcement and fire agencies in Polk County are set to participate in this memorable event,"" organizers said.
Honoring Our Heroes — Remembering the Day will take place on
Wednesday, Sept. 11 at Central Park in downtown Winter Haven.
The event begins at 6:30 p.m. featuring the Freedom Walk to honor all
military, law enforcement, firefighters and EMS heroes, followed by a moving
service that will pay tribute to all heroes who call Polk County home.
The evening will culminate with a sunset luminary service as every attendee holds
a candle in honor of all of our heroes. Candles will be provided.
""This event is a way to pull all of Polk County together and show our local
heroes how much they mean to us,"" said Gary Clark, Chairman of the Polk County
Veteran's Council. ""As a community, we should pay tribute to all of those who
serve us on a daily basis, putting their lives on the line whether here at
home or abroad.""
American studies scholar Angus Gillespie of Rutgers University said New York's Twin Towers were more than office buildings.
""They are symbols of America, just as the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben represent their countries,"" he explained. ""The builders intended the towers to make a statement about the importance of the Port of New York and New Jersey. The complex rose like Emerald City, with fountains and sculptures from what was once a dilapidated area of half-abandoned stores.""
Gillespie conducted a number of interviews prior to the attacks with bankers, shippers, freight forwarders, traders and other workers in the Twin Towers prior to the attacks.
""It was the people who worked there, however, who gave this complex life, purpose, and vibrancy,"" he added.

7,/florida/lakeland/watch-live-president-trump-set-announce-2020-re-election-bid,2019-06-18T21:11:34Z,WATCH AGAIN: Trump Announces Re-Election Bid,0,14,Paul Scicchitano,Patch Staff,"ORLANDO, FL — Amid chants of USA and a sea of red hats and shirts, President Donald Trump kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign, not on an escalator like last time, but in Orlando Tuesday night with thousands of supporters at the Amway Center.
""We're going to keep making America great again and then we will indeed keep America great,"" the president told the crowd. ""We're going to keep it better than ever before and that is why tonight I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term as president of the United States.""
The event opened a few minutes early as Vice President Mike Pence stepped up to the podium first.
""We're here for one reason and one reason only: America needs four more years of President Donald Trump,"" Pence said. ""It's on everybody. Time for round two. The 503-day campaign for America's future starts tonight.""
The PBS ""News Hour"" livestreamed the rally (See the link below.) The president's political opponents held a counter event ahead of the president's remarks called the Win With Love Rally, featuring the Baby Trump balloon, less than a mile away.

""I can promise you that I will never ever let you down. I won't,"" the president assured the crowd to cheers before thanking his family members by name, including Melania and his children.
The president began speaking around 8:15 p.m. as he and first lady Melania Trump were introduced by the vice president. He spoke for less than an hour before announcing his run for a second term around 8:54 p.m.
At one point the president called on White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who is leaving at the end of the month, to join him at the podium, saying that he had a feeling she was going to run for a ""certain gubernatorial position"" when she leaves the White House.
""This has been truly the honor of a lifetime, one of the most incredible experiences anybody could ever imagine,"" said Sanders, an Arkansas native who has been discussed as a possible 2022 gubernatorial candidate in Arkansas. Her father, Mike Huckabee, served as governor of the state for more than a decade before becoming a conservative talk show host.
""That's because I've had a chance to be on the front row of history and watch you drastically change our country for the better,"" Sanders said. ""You've made America great. You're going to continue to make America great. I couldn't be prouder to be part of your team.""
Pence touched on familiar Republican themes like pro life, immigration and the threat of socialism as he touted the president's progress in strengthening the military, improving the economy and putting pressure on Mexico to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants.
""President Trump promised to revive the American economy by rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy, fighting for fair trade deals and cutting taxes. And President Trump delivered — 5.8 million new jobs since Election Day and the unemployment rate has hit a 50-year-low,"" said Pence.
""That's what we call promises made and promises kept. But to keep America great, we have to re-elect the president who has been fighting for you every day,"" Pence continued. ""We've done so much but there's much more to do. That's why we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Four more years means more jobs, more judges, more support for our troops and it's going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.""
A Quinnipiac University telephone poll of 1,279 self-identified registered voters in Florida gave former Vice President Joe Biden an advantage over the president in a head-to-head matchup.
The poll, released Tuesday, found that Biden would beat the president by a margin of 50 percent to 41 percent if the election were held now. The poll was conducted between June 12 to 17 and has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percent.
President Trump made references to ""Sleepy Joe"" and ""Crazy Bernie Sanders"" in his remarks.
""America will never be a socialist country — ever,"" Trump declared.
Republicans in the Sunshine State would back the president by a margin of 90 percent to 7 percent, while Biden would take the Democrat vote by a margin of 91 percent to 3 percent, according to the poll. Biden would also take independent voters by a margin of 54 percent to 32 percent while more men than women would choose Trump over Biden, the survey found. Biden leads the president among women by a margin of 58 to 34 percent.
Trump leads Biden 52 percent to 42 percent among white voters, while Biden leads 79 percent to 9 percent among black voters and 57 percent to 32 percent among Florida's Hispanic voters.
The president insisted at the rally that African-Americans were experiencing the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of the country. He said Hispanics, Asians and women were also seeing their best unemployment numbers under his administration.
The Quinnipiac poll also gave Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders an edge over the president in a head-to-head matchup by a margin of 48 percent to 42 percent. The university said matchups between Trump and other Democratic contenders were too close to call.
""President Donald Trump trails both former Vice President Joseph Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders in general election matchups and basically ties other leading Democratic challengers,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. ""While most Florida voters are feeling better financially, President Trump remains underwater with a 44 percent job approval rating and a 51 percent disapproval rating.""
In addition to the former vice president and Sen. Sanders, the president is also facing a crowded field of Democrats that includes Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who are all jockeying to face President Trump in next year's general election.
The president asked his supporters at Tuesday's rally to choose between two campaign slogans — Make America Great Again or Keep America Great. The crowd overwhelmingly choose the latter.
""Keep America great,"" the president said of the more popular slogan. ""We're going to keep on fighting for every man, woman and child all across this land.""
The rally ended around 9:37 with a recording of ""You can't Always Get What You Wanted"" by the Rolling Stones.

Ron DeSantis ordered a review of election security measures throughout the state Wednesday, including all 67 counties, following ""recent information"" from federal officials that Russian hackers gained access to voter databases in two Florida counties ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
In a letter to Florida Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee, DeSantis noted that the breaches did not compromise the election outcome but said they highlight the importance of protecting Florida's election systems.
""Accordingly, I direct the Department of State to immediately initiate a review of the security, particularly the cybersecurity of our state's elections systems and the elections systems of Florida's 67 counties,"" DeSantis stated in the letter. See also FBI's Secrecy About Russian Election Hacking Untenable: FL Reps
The governor has said that he signed an agreement with the FBI not to disclose the names of the counties involved, but that election officials in those counties were aware of the intrusions.
More than $14.5 million in federal election security grants was distributed to supervisors of elections in 2018, while Florida also provided $1.9 million in funding to purchase and install ALBERT network monitoring sensors that can detect cyber threats and quickly alert officials when data may be at risk, according to state officials, who said Florida has more ALBERT sensors than any other state.
Following a briefing with FBI and Homeland Security officials last week, bi-partisan Florida members of the U.S. House of Representatives held a news conference in which they expressed outrage that Florida officials were never informed of the breach.
The 2016 hacking incident came to light last month when the 448-page report by White House Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was released. The report referenced the fact that Russian hackers had launched a phishing attack on the database systems of elections offices throughout Florida.
DeSantis also ordered the Department of State to develop a plan to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
""You are further directed to make this a top priority of the department, and report your findings to the executive office of the governor upon completion of your review,"" the governor's letter said.
DeSantis said his administration will continue to place a high priority on election security and protecting voter information.
""Public faith in our elections is the bedrock of our democracy and we must do everything within our power to preserve the integrity of our elections systems,"" the governor added.

That all changed Friday as a contractor began the painstaking work of moving the more than century old statue to its new home in Veterans Memorial Park.
'This morning, the Munn Park Confederate Monument was removed from its base and is now waiting for its new home in Veterans' Memorial Park to be ready,"" said city officials.
The monument has been a source of controversy in this Florida community just as similar monuments have sparked debates throughout the United States.
Lakeland commissioners voted late last year in favor of using money generated by the city's red light camera citations to pay for the move, which is estimated to cost around $210,000. The vote reversed an earlier decision to require the move to be paid with private funds.
Cities across the nation have faced similar pressure to remove their Confederate monuments following the deadly white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the 2015 massacre of black worshippers at a South Carolina church by an avowed white supremacist.
Lakeland officials said the cost includes a $20,000 cushion to pay for unforeseen expenses. during the four-day removal and relocation of the monument.

In one of the messages, Maurice Nelson Campbell of Fort Meade, Florida allegedly declared: ""And this is Maurice Campbell, and I approve that (expletive) message, and you can believe that.""
The 59-year-old Campbell was arrested Tuesday by Polk County Sheriff's deputies on a charge of aggravated stalking.
""The arrest followed an investigation of a complaint from the victim, who told detectives that the two women had known each other for years, and Campbell had repeatedly harassed her, accusing the victim of having an intimate relationship with Campbell's husband,"" according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office.
""The victim had contacted law enforcement about the harassment in the past, but refrained from pursuing criminal charges after Campbell would stop harassing,"" the sheriff's office said.
Campbell had been arrested in the past on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Jacksonville, shoplifting in Orlando and petty larceny-failure to appear in Orange County, Florida, according to the sheriff's office.
""The victim told detectives that on Friday, Feb. 8, 2019, she received
calls at 4:46 p.m. and 7:13 p.m., from a phone number belonging to Campbell's
husband, which she did not answer,"" the sheriff's office said. ""A third call was made at 11:55 p.m., and the victim answered, and she immediately recognized the voice on the phone as being Ms. Campbell, so she disconnected.""
The sheriff's office said the victim also received calls at 11:59 p.m. and two more at 12:49
a.m., which she didn't answer.
""The victim turned her phone off for the rest of the night, then awoke to find
three missed calls from Campbell's phone, along with three voicemails from Ms.
Campbell (two from her phone, and a third from an unknown number), all from
the early morning hours of Feb. 9,"" the sheriff's office said.
The voicemail messages also included a threat to cause the victim physical harm.
In one message, Campbell allegedly said: ""I'll beat your (expletive) (expletive) down, you trifling (expletive), stinking (expletive) (expletive). You rotten (expletive), you rotten
(expletive),"" the sheriff's office said.
The victim told detectives that she believes the vice mayor uses her position on the Fort Meade City Commission to intimidate her.
""The victim has put up with this harassment for quite some time, and she
finally reached a breaking point. This is not proper behavior for anyone, let
alone an elected official,"" explained Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. ""Leaving the voicemails, especially one that sounded like the end of a campaign commercial, wasn't good judgement either."""

Ron DeSantis is hoping to land the earthly headquarters of the Pentagon's new Space Command.
""As the most military friendly state in the country with a fast-growing commercial aerospace industry, Florida is the ideal location for USSPACECOM,"" DeSantis penned in a letter to President Trump on Tuesday.
""In addition to an already existing infrastructure and a highly trained workforce, Florida has enduring partnerships with both the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"" the letter stated.
DeSantis ordered Space Florida to make it a top priority to ""pursue and secure this new headquarters here in Florida."" Space Florida is the state's official voice on space-related matters, including serving as a liaison to the federal government on related issues.
President Trump signed a one-page memorandum in December authorizing the Defense Department to create the Pentagon's new Space in an effort to better organize and advance the military's vast operations in space. The move could cost as much as $800 million over the next five years and Florida wants a piece of the vast space pie.
Appearing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Vice President Mike Pence described Space Command as a ""new era of American national security in space.""
On Tuesday, Trump signed Space Policy Directive 4, establishing a new space-focused extension of the U.S. Air Force to be housed at USSPACECOM.
The first rocket launch at Cape Canaveral took place in 1950 and the facility has been used ever since.
""Florida is home to several important and strategic facilities and Air Force based, including the Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso and Patrick Air Force Base in Cocoa Beach, which currently provides space launch operations through the 45th Space Wing,"" the governor said in his letter.
The establishment of Space Command comes amid growing concerns that China and Russia are working on ways to disrupt, disable or even destroy U.S. satellites.
Space Command is separate from the president's much touted goal of creating a ""Space Force"" as an independent armed service branch, but is considered a first step in that direction.
""Florida's growing commercial space industry provides jobs for nearly 100,000 Floridians in over 470 aerospace and aviation companies that do business in the state,"" the Florida governor's office added. ""These companies export more than $7.6 billion in goods annually, providing major economic impact to Florida. USSPACECOM headquarters would significantly reinforce the positive impact the space industry has on Florida's economy.""

""I sincerely want to extend my gratitude for the opportunity to work as a police officer for this great city over the last 34 years,"" Giddens said. ""It has indeed been my honor to serve our citizens, to work in concert with all the city employees delivering excellent customer service daily, and to work for you. I can guarantee you I gave it all I had every day, but the day has come to hang up my gun belt.""

Giddens said he couldn't imagine spending his career doing anything else.
""For me, being a cop is all I ever wanted to be and I have cherished every moment,"" he explained. ""The honor to serve as the chief for the very best police department in the country certainly exceeded all my expectations.""
He closed by thanking Lakeland residents and city officials for ""allowing me to live my dream.""
Lakeland City Manager Tony Delgado called the announcement bittersweet for the community of about 108,000.
""Larry is more than a fantastic public servant, chief of police and leader within our organization and community,"" said Delgado. ""He is a great friend to me.""
Giddens began his law enforcement career in 1984 as an auxiliary police 0fficer with the department.
He was hired full time the following year and drew various patrol assignments, including field training officer, honor guard and uniform crime scene technician.
In 1987 Giddens was selected as a SWAT member and served on the department's Street Crimes Unit. He went on to become a K-9 Officer in 1989 with the Street Crimes Unit and Patrol Division.
Giddens was promoted to sergeant in 1993 and served as patrol sergeant. In 1994, he was assigned to the Street Crimes Unit of the Special Operations Section and served as sergeant for the Street Crimes Unit over the next seven years.
He was promoted to lieutenant in 2001 and became the officer in charge of Delta Squad in the Neighborhood Services Bureau. Giddens was later transferred to the Special Investigations Section as the 0fficer in charge. He went on to become the officer in charge of the Neighborhood Liaison Section. His unit conducted undercover operations, crime prevention and helped set up Neighborhood Watch programs.
Giddens was promoted to captain in December of 2009 and served as commanding officer of the Uniform Patrol Division. He remained in this position until October 2011, when he was promoted to assistant chief in charge of the Neighborhood Services Bureau. Giddens has served as chief since December of 2014.
In addition to his field experience, Giddens graduated from the FBI National Academy in December of 2005. He has an associate's degree in criminal justice from Polk Community College and a bachelor of arts degree in criminology from Saint Leo University. He is a Certified Public Manager through Florida State University and graduated from the Senior Management Institute for Police in July 2011.
Delgado said he tried to talk Giddens into staying longer.
""Larry has been pondering this decision for weeks and I selfishly discussed options that would hopefully keep him as Lakeland's chief of police,"" Delgado shared. ""However, I understand that there are opportunities in life that present themselves and even though we are going to miss him as our dedicated chief of police, we wish him well as he starts a new chapter outside of the organization he grew up in.""

15,/florida/lakeland/lakeland-will-pay-move-confederate-monument,2018-11-21T00:19:57Z,Lakeland Will Pay To Move Confederate Monument,0,0,Paul Scicchitano,Patch Staff,"LAKELAND, FL — Reversing an earlier decision, the Lakeland City Commission has agreed to use public money to move the Confederate Monument from Munn Park to Veterans Memorial Park. The monument has been a source of controversy in this Florida community just as similar monuments have sparked debates throughout the United States.
The commission voted 5-2 at its Monday meeting in favor of using money generated by the city's red light camera citations to pay for the move, which is estimated to cost around $210,000, according to city officials. The vote reversed a May 7 decision to require the move to be paid for solely with private funds.
Subscribe to Lakeland Patch for our free morning newsletter and regular news alerts
A group called Save Southern Heritage said it filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday to block the removal of the monument.
""The suit was filed in response to the action by the Lakeland City Commission last night that reversed the previous decision to require private donations to pay for the cost of taking the cenotaph out of the park,"" according to the group. ""The lawsuit includes a request for an emergency temporary restraining order ... that would prevent the city or its employees, or contractors to begin removing the monument or to obstruct it from public view.""
Cities across the nation have faced similar pressure to remove their Confederate monuments following the deadly white nationalist protest little more than a year ago in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the 2015 massacre of black worshippers at a South Carolina church by an avowed white supremacist.
Attorney David McCallister, who represents the group, said that the city left no other option following Monday's vote.
""It really was a mob scene,"" McCallister said. ""Most of the people that spoke really want the cenotaph destroyed, and we don't expect it to last long in Veterans Park, if we lose our appeal to the court.""
City officials said that the cost estimate includes a $20,000 cushion to pay for unforeseen expenses.
""The original quote regarding the monument relocation is around $150,000,"" according to city officials. ""This quote does not include the cost to rebuild a base for the monument, the estimated $3,500 for security cameras, the cost for fiber connect at Veterans Park and approximately $4,000 for fencing.""
Officials said that the estimate is based on a four-day removal and relocation of the monument.
""Estimates include security, insurance (if required) Munn Park rehabilitation, Parks and Recreation personnel, traffic assistance, etc.,"" officials added.

There are bad tax proposals and then there are really bad tax proposals like the one being offered to Hillsborough County residents on the November Ballot. This Ballot initiative has enough holes in it to embarrass a block of Swiss cheese.
If you are considering voting YES on this Referendum, you will need to do some serious research. Below are a bunch of links to articles and Blog Posts about the referendum and the use of the funds it will generate.

The revenue from this tax is controlled by an unknown board appointed by unnamed elected officials. The tax applies to all residents of Hillsborough County, but a significant portion of the funds goes to just three Cities. Another large chunk goes to HART the Hillsborough County Bus line. They're very inadequate controls and a significant lack of accountability.
It may be time for a tax to support transportation improvement in Hillsborough County, but this proposal is a light rail/developer's delight not a commuter's solution.

18,/florida/lakeland/deaths-lakelands-signature-swans-ruffling-feathers,2018-09-04T14:37:05Z,City To Consider Ways To Better Protect The Swans,0,0,D'Ann Lawrence White,Patch Staff,"LAKELAND, FL – The graceful bevy of swans that has served as the city of Lakeland's mascot for 60 years may be dying out.
In the last three weeks, six swans trying to cross Lake Morton Drive, which circles Lake Morton, have been struck by cars.
One of the swans survived and is being nursed back to health by Dr. Patricia Mattson of Companion Animal Hospital, who cares for the city's swans that live on Lake Morton and Lake Mirror.
Mattson said the swan was lucky. It only has a bruised wing and will most likely be released back into the lake this week.
The other swans suffered painful deaths, she said.
The deaths of the regal creatures is ruffling feathers at city hall. The city has posted a plea on its social media sites for motorists to keep an eye out for swans crossing to road.
Additionally, city officials and nearby residents plan to meet Thursday, Sept. 6, to discuss ways to slow or reduce traffic around the lake to prevent further swan deaths.
The 70 swans on the lake are the descendants of a pair of swans from Queen Elizabeth II's world-famous collection in England. They were shipped from England to Lakeland in 1957.
Since then, the birds, which weigh up to 50 pounds, have been cared for by the city and are protected by city ordinance. Anyone who intentionally harms a swan can be charged with a crime.
The city has been conscientious about making sure the birds are cared for and healthy. Each year the city holds a swan roundup, giving each swan a checkup and any needed veterinary care in assembly line fashion.
While the swans appear to float effortlessly across the lake, their pace out of the water is hardly elegant. Their slow, clumsy walk leaves them vulnerable to the 4,600 vehicles that use Lake Morton Drive each day.
Suggestions from residents on the city's Facebook page to prevent further swan deaths include the installation of ""Swan Crossing"" signs, speed humps, tougher penalties for distracted drivers who run over swans, a larger law enforcement around the lake and making Lake Morton Drive a one-way road.
""Please put speed bumps in,"" said Natalie Slater. ""I see people driving too fast and don't even bother to slow down when the swans or any other birds are crossing the street. They also don't slow down when there are kids near the street.""
""Swans mate for life so when one is killed, its mate suffers as well,"" said B.J. Miller. ""We should better protect our beautiful swan community. They are truly Lakeland's brand. We all hate speed humps so adding multiple ones around Lake Morton sounds reasonable.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Polk County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in the 2016 election, working with ProPublica to bring you information on broken scanners and long lines at the polls in Brooklyn, the extension of voting hours in Durham County, North Carolina, due to technical issues, voting improprieties in Texas, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and much more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:"

Ron DeSantis at a news conference hosted at the Polk County Sheriff's Office. The ACLU of Florida and at least one Democratic lawmaker criticized the bill, which they said aims to provide cover for police brutality and to silence dissent.
Law enforcement leaders from around Florida, including Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, stood behind DeSantis at the sheriff's office in a show of support for the bill, which is to be introduced in the next legislative session.
The legislation includes felony penalties for protesters involved in looting and other forms of violence, and for those who block roadways while demonstrating.
""You know recently in our country, we have seen attacks on law enforcement,"" DeSantis said. ""We've seen disorder and tumult in many cities across the country. You all have situations where buildings will be in flames and on TV, even though sometimes the news will say it's peaceful, you see the flames behind there, and I think this has been a really, really sad chapter in American history.""
DeSantis said he thought law enforcement from around the state and the Florida National Guard did a great job of responding to protests that spread across the state following the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video struggling to breathe and pleading for help as a Minnesota police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck.
""You didn't see the type of disorder here in the state of Florida that you did throughout many parts of the country,"" said DeSantis. ""But I think we need to do more than what we've already done.""
The governor said ""The Combating Violence Disorder and Looting and Law Enforcement Protection Act"" will probably be the boldest piece of legislation to address these issues.
Provision in the law include:
DeSantis said the bill will impose mandatory jail time, keeping people from rejoining protests right away, which he said took place in Portland.
""If you are involved in a violent or disorderly assembly and you harm somebody, and you throw a brick and hit a police officer, you're going to jail with a mandatory jail sentence for at least six months for anyone who strikes a police officer with a weapon or any projectile,"" said DeSantis. ""And we're also not going to simply let people back out onto the streets; so if you are in custody for one of these offenses related to a violent or disorderly assembly, you're not getting bail before your first appearance.""
The ACLU of Florida condemned DeSantis' proposed bill on Facebook.
""Governor Ron DeSantis' proposal is undemocratic and hostile to Americans' shared values,"" the organization said. ""This effort has one goal: silence, criminalize and penalize Floridians who want to see justice for Black lives lost to radicalized violence and brutality at the hands of law enforcement.""
Florida Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani expressed her disapproval of the bill and those in support of it on Twitter.
""Florida Sheriffs Association & Police Chiefs Association do as they always do — completely ignore racism in policing and instead support increased criminal penalties,"" Eskamani said. ""What a disgrace. If you're a local chief or sheriff that doesn't speak against this proposal, you are complicit."""

More than 11 million Floridians voted in this year's election.
In 2016, Trump narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who earned 47.4 percent of the vote, to win Florida in the presidential election.
Democrats were hoping Joe Biden could capitalize on how close that 2016 race was and defeat Trump in the Sunshine State this year. Biden received 47.85 percent of the vote, according to Florida's Election Watch website.
Florida emerged as a key battleground state early in this election, and both presidential candidates focused their campaign efforts there in the weeks leading up to Election Day.
So how did Trump's support in Polk County compare with his vote totals in 2016, when he was running against Clinton?
In 2016, he earned 157,418 votes compared to 194,271 votes in 2020.
Tuesday's vote climaxed a heated battle for control of the White House, unfolding during a pandemic that killed nearly a quarter of a million Americans before Election Day.
Trump had struggled to overcome polling deficits in key states in the campaign's final days. He ran strong, as expected, in rural areas, but lost support among other critical voting groups, including suburban women in several battleground states.
CNN reported in October that polling put Biden up by 25 points among women voters. According to the final 2016 pre-election polls, Clinton won women voters by 13 points among likely voters and 14 points among registered voters.
