Social Security touches the lives of nearly every American, whether at the birth of a child, the loss of a loved one, the onset of a disability, or the transition from work to retirement. For more than 80 years, our programs have contributed to the financial security of the elderly and the disabled. Social Security replaces a percentage of a worker's pre-retirement income based on their lifetime earnings. The amount of your average wages that Social Security retirement benefits replaces varies depending on your earnings and when you choose to start benefits. If you start benefits after full retirement age, these percentages are higher. If you start benefits earlier, these percentages are lower. Most financial advisers say you will need about 70 percent of pre-retirement income to live comfortably in retirement, including your Social Security benefits, investments, and personal savings.
You can learn more about retirement benefits at www.socialsecurity.gov/benefits/retirement. Our resources and publications are easy to share with people you think might need the information.
Many people think of Social Security as just a retirement program. And it's true that most of the people receiving benefits are retired, but others receive benefits because they're:
If you can't work because of a physical or mental condition that's expected to last at least one year or result in death, you may be eligible for Social Security disability benefits.
Our disability rules are different from private or other government agency programs. Qualifying for disability from another agency or program doesn't mean you will be eligible for disability benefits from us. Having a statement from your doctor saying you're disabled doesn't mean you'll automatically be eligible for Social Security disability benefits.
. We've made learning about our disability programs very easy at www.socialsecurity.gov/benefits/disability.
Please share these resources with friends and family who might need them."

In the digital age, frauds and scams are an unfortunate part of doing business online. Recently, Social Security has seen a spike in phishing scams and we want to protect you as best we can.
We urge you to always be cautious and to avoid providing sensitive information such as your Social Security Number (SSN) or bank account information to unknown individuals over the phone or internet. If you receive a call and aren't expecting one, you must be extra careful. You can always get the caller's information, hang up, and — if you do need more clarification — contact the official phone number of the business or agency that the caller claims to represent. Never reveal personal data to a stranger who called you.
Please take note; there's a scam going around right now. You might receive a call from someone claiming to be from Social Security or another agency. Calls can even display the 1-800-772-1213, Social Security's national customer service number, as the incoming number on your caller ID. In some cases, the caller states that Social Security does not have all of your personal information, such as your Social Security number (SSN), on file. Other callers claim Social Security needs additional information so the agency can increase your benefit payment, or that Social Security will terminate your benefits if they do not confirm your information. This appears to be a widespread issue, as reports have come from people across the country. These calls are not from Social Security.
Callers sometimes state that your Social Security number is at risk of being deactivated or deleted. The caller then asks you to provide a phone number to resolve the issue. People should be aware the scheme's details may vary; however, you should avoid engaging with the caller or calling the number provided, as the caller might attempt to acquire personal information.
Social Security employees occasionally contact people by telephone for customer-service purposes. In only a few special situations, such as when you have business pending with us, a Social Security employee may request the person confirm personal information over the phone."

Calderon, who says she has been living in the U.S. since age 3 when her parents brought her here from Guatemala, was arrested in Johnston in January while trying to clear up her immigration status. Although under a final deportation order, Calderon was eligible to apply for citizenship as the wife of an American citizen, thanks to an Obama-era special exception. She was attempting to do that when immigration officials arrested her and took her to prison.
The ACLU took up her cause, and she was released and allowed to return to her family. Her case is still pending, however. In addition, the ACLU in Massachusetts filed a class action lawsuit against the Trump administration to help her and several others who are undocumented but have not broken any other laws. The ACLU case focuses on married couples who are being separated when one is detained.

John Carnevale on Wednesday pleaded no contest to a perjury charge, the state Attorney General's office said. Carnevale, 56, is running for his old District 13 seat. However, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea said Wednesday his name is being removed from the ballot. He was sentenced to five years but with ""nine months to serve on home confinement and the remainder suspended with probation."" The sentence starts on Aug. 22, conditional on the determination Carnevale is eligible for home confinement.
The perjury charge was connected to a July 13, 2016 hearing before Providence Board of Canvassers. According to the state Attorney General's office, he ""lied under oath three times in response to questions stating he resided at 150 Barbara Street, Providence.""
""When elected officials lie, whether it be to a public body like the Board of Canvassers or the people they are elected to serve, it erodes the public's faith in all government,"" said Attorney General Kilmartin. ""Despite this defendant's arrogance and attitude that he was untouchable, today's plea proves just the opposite - no one is above the law. It is my hope that today's plea will help restore some of the public's trust, knowing that police and prosecutors will continue to hold our public officials accountable for their actions.""

The wild turkeys gave local animal control officers a battle of wits, as law enforcement tried to corral the turkeys. One of the birds is still at large.
The turkeys became an issue when Mayor Joseph Poliseno complained they posed a traffic hazard. He didn't want to see the birds run over or cause an accident.
Here's the latest, according to the state Department of Environmental Management.
""Johnston applied for and now has a DEM 'collector's permit,' allowing it to capture and relocate nuisance turkeys elsewhere in town,"" said Michael Healy, DEM's chief public affairs officer. ""Our understanding is that Johnston's Animal Control Officer (ACO) captured and removed two of the birds earlier this morning. The third turkey got away.""
But there was a glitch.
""As the town requested, DEM had a Wildlife Control Officer at Town Hall at 8 this morning to meet and assist the Johnston ACO. Likely because of a miscommunication, however, our officer wasn't contacted and Johnston handled the relocation on its own,"" Healey said.
He did not say where the birds were relocated. WJAR-TV reported the turkeys were headed for Snake Den State Park.

8,/rhode-island/johnston/rhode-island-superfund-site-cleanup-be-speeded,2018-07-10T14:57:35Z,Rhode Island Superfund Site Cleanup Sped Up,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"JOHNSTON, RI - From the Department of Justice; Office of Public Affairs: The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) announced today that two subsidiaries of Stanley Black & Decker Inc.—Emhart Industries Inc. and Black & Decker Inc.—have agreed to clean up dioxin contaminated sediment and soil at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site in North Providence and Johnston, Rhode Island.
""We are pleased to reach a resolution through collaborative work with the responsible parties, EPA, and other stakeholders,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""Today's settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.""
""This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,"" said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. ""The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.""
""Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,"" said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. ""We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.""
""We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,"" said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. ""The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.""
The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation.
The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State's goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.
Under the settlement, Emhart and Black & Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site.
Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black & Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin.
The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart's predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.
The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties.
The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days. The Consent Decree can be viewed on the Justice Department website: www.justice.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html.

The exception helped immigrants, if they were marrying U.S. citizens, even though they were under a final deportation order,. Calderon was under a final deportation order after her whole family lost its bid to stay in the U.S. According to court papers filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in Boston, her family could have appealed but told prosecutors they had already left the U.S. The ACLU in Boston is trying to help her and several others who are undocumented but have not broken any other laws. Their case focuses on married couples who are being separated when one is detained.
Calderon has said recently her parents brought her to America when she was 3, and she has never left the U.S.
According to Mass Live's report, the new Boston interim director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Boston field office, Rebecca Adducci, filed court papers to reverse the February order that stopped the arrests.

""Father Pat Conroy has served the U.S. House of Representatives for the last seven years with grace and humility. He is truly one of the most generous and kind people I've ever known. Like so many members of Congress, Father Pat has provided me thoughtful counsel and guidance over the years. He's respected by members of both parties and all religious traditions. He embodies the Jesuit values of intellectual rigor and, especially, caring for the vulnerable and poor.""

""I was proud to join the full House in electing him to a two-year term last year, and I am deeply disturbed by reports that Father Pat may have been forced out because he encouraged the House to remember the less fortunate during the recent tax debate. Father Pat's prayer was a reflection of the central tenets of his Catholic faith. I hope the Speaker did not dismiss him because of it and urge the Speaker to reverse this terrible decision.""

Gina Raimondo told the Building Trades unions she is running for another term, and she supports the prevailing wage. Raimondo delivered a speech in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. In her remarks, she mentioned the projects her administration has undertaken to put construction workers back on the job. Among the projects, she included her $1 billion plan to replace and rebuild the public schools.
State Rep. Patricia Morgan, a declared Republican candidate for governor, had suggested saving the taxpayers money by not paying the prevailing wage for the school construction jobs. But Raimondo, without mentioning Morgan, stood squarely with the unions and demands for the prevailing wage. The unions had a seat on the panel that developed the billion dollar plan for the schools. No taxpayer groups were represented.
Here is the governor's speech.


Right after I was sworn in, I ended our state's freeze on school construction. And I added funding for high priority projects in my first budget. Because of that, we've been able to fix a handful of our worst schools, including one in Pawtucket. It was a 100-year-old building, and you knew it the minute you walked in the door. Today, because we came together and made an investment, it's bright. It's clean. It's got a new library. And it's been totally rebuilt and wired for the 21st century.
Attendance is up. Disciplinary problems are down. There isn't a parent in Rhode Island who wouldn't be proud to send their kid there.
We need to keep going. I'm working this year to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our schools. Together, with the 39 cities and towns in my state, I'm pushing for a $1 billion investment over the next five years to fix our public schools. It'll be good for our kids, and it'll be good for the plumbers and pipe-fitters who will have consistent work.

The ACLU in Massachusetts and in Rhode Island today filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Calderon and four other undocumented aliens. The ruling would apply to all other people in their situation. All are married to U.S. citizens but were issued final deportation orders. Some, like Calderon, were imprisoned by immigration authorities, while others are wearing bracelets with navigational systems, so the government can track their movements.
Calderon, 30, entered the U.S. illegally in 1991 with her parents when she was 3. Immigration authorities found them several years later. Her father applied for asylum and was denied in 1999. The family was given 60 days to leave voluntarily. They pursued several legal avenues to stay in the U.S. Last January, Calderon was detained by immigration officials in Johnston where she and her husband had gone trying to validate their marriage.
The government said she already has been issued a final deportation order and has exhausted all her legal options.
Calderon and her husband were married in 2016 after the birth of their second child and the same year the government changed the law so some undocumented aliens could stay in the country while they attempted to obtain legal status. Their first step would be to validate their marriage, which Calderon was attempting to do when she was taken into custody.
The ACLU said the laws are in conflict in that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says one thing, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the opposite.
Calderon has since completed the second step towards legalizing her status. She obtained conditional approval to leave the country and return after being deported. To see the entire class action suit papers, click here.

Stephen R. Ucci announced that the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority has agreed to reinstate bus service on Simmonsville Avenue in Johnston on at least a trial basis.
Beginning Jan. 13, RIPTA's Route 19 will run along Atwood Avenue and Simmonsville Avenue instead of Plainfield Street during some scheduled daily trips. Other scheduled trips will remain on the current route, which stays on Plainfield Street to access Walmart in Johnston. Riders should consult RIPTA's schedules at ripta.com for a route map and specific schedules of when the bus will take each route.
Representative Ucci has been meeting with residents at Simmons Village on Simmonsville Avenue and RIPTA officials for about 18 months in an effort to restore Simmonsville Avenue bus service, which was cut several years ago. The result was an agreement to restore the service for some daily runs for six months, at which time RIPTA will evaluate the ridership and determine whether to sustain, expand or eliminate that part of the route.
The Simmonsville Avenue leg of the route will feature a bus stop at the entrance to Simmons Village, where residents have sought restoration of that part of the route ever since it was eliminated.
""For those who rely on the bus for all transportation, having a route that goes by their home makes a tremendous difference to their quality of life. I'm very grateful that RIPTA was able to accommodate this request, which will significantly improve the lives of many people who live at Simmons Village and other places along the route. I'd like to encourage everyone in the area to take full advantage of the service, both because the bus is an affordable way to get around Rhode Island and because ridership will determine whether the route will be made permanent,"" said Representative Ucci (D-Dist. 42, Johnston, Cranston).
Representative Ucci thanked Mayor Joseph M. Polisena, Senator Frank Lombardo III, Councilman Richard J. DelFino III, Christine Jordan from Picerne Properties, Brooks Almonte at RIPTA and Lynn Farkas, a resident at Simmons Village, for their efforts in advocating for the route change.
