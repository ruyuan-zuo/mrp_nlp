This new truck will provide a more convenient way for residents to utilize the Township food pantry through deliveries, and for individuals, organizations and businesses to make donations.

April 28, 2020
Dear Governor Pritzker,
During this unprecedented challenge to our state, you stressed multiple times your willingness and eagerness to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle and from every part of the state. As the women of the House Republican Caucus, we stand ready to offer solutions and work with you to implement a safe and reasonable regional plan to open Illinois. We are business owners, scientists, mayors, lawyers, community organizers, volunteers, officers, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, caregivers, and legislators. We represent 880,000 Illinoisans across all regions of the state—from the Chicago suburbs to regions in northern, western, eastern, southern, and central Illinois.
Our family members and constituents are fighting on the front lines as healthcare workers. We know and love people who are diagnosed with and suffering from COVID-19. We know, love, and represent people who lost their jobs, closed their small businesses, and exhausted their savings. For us, this is not political. This is personal.
We asked many questions concerning IDPH modeling, PPE procurement process and inventory, IDOC policies for transfers and releases, issues at IDES, safeguarding Long Term Care Facilities, and protecting state facilities for veterans and the developmentally disabled. We made many suggestions to promote physical and mental wellbeing, including opening state parks, locking down our prisons, housing our homeless, and protecting our most vulnerable populations. You did respond to our request for IDNR to open our state parks, thank you.
Unfortunately, a majority of our questions and suggestions are not acknowledged. We reached out to you, but you have not contacted one Republican woman legislator to discuss our concerns, suggestions, or solutions. We are writing to tell you as a matter of record the House Republican Women are here for Illinois. We are ready to offer suggestions, strategies, and solutions; and we are calling for the legislature to reconvene. We want to do our job as essential employees for our state and want to work with you to safely and regionally reopen our state.
SAFELY
● As elected officials, we have a responsibility to all Illinois citizens. Our number one priority as wereopen Illinois is to protect those who are vulnerable to this virus and ensure they have the appropriate support and necessary resources.
REASONABLY
● Illinois needs a reasoned and common-sense plan to reopen our state region by region understanding the virus affects each region differently. Some of these common sense steps include:
RESPONSIBLY
● Our constituents deserve a responsible government—a government where there are effective checks and balances and a government where all voices are heard. A responsible government means calling the legislature back to session.
REGIONALLY
● One size does not fit all. We must safely open our state on a regional basis. Other states including New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa proposed measured, regional reopening strategies.
We, the women of the House Republican Caucus, ask you to work with us. We are prepared to work on a serious plan to reopen Illinois safely, reasonably, responsibly, and regionally. We request you meet with us collectively as a group to share our ideas and offer solutions. We must continue to protect our vulnerable populations and safeguard our healthcare delivery systems, while we must also save our economy and our families. We are prepared to assist in developing and implementing a plan to safely get Illinois back to business reasonably, regionally, and responsibly.
Finally, as members of a co-equal branch of government, we request you call a special legislative session to start work on reopening Illinois safely and regionally.
We are ready and await a meeting with you.
Sincerely,
Rep. Avery Bourne
Rep. Terri Bryant
Rep. Amy L. Grant

As Maine Township continues to deal with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic, CDC guidelines are being followed and policies and procedures updated as necessary. While the physical Townhall remains closed through at least April 30, most regular Township services are still being offered to the public. Specifically, the Food Pantry and emergency General Assistance are open and handling an incredible increase in requests. ""As of April 3, staff delivered over 400 food boxes to the public,"" said Supervisor Laura J. Morask. Maine Township residents may pick up food box from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. General Assistance is operating as it has been since the beginning of the shelter in place orders.
As part of its response to the larger community, the Supervisor asked the Office of Emergency Management pull together any masks they had stored or could find and donated hundreds of masks to Lutheran General Hospital and North Maine Fire Department in several batches. ""We were so happy to be able to help our medical staff and first responders on the front lines"" said Supervisor Morask.
""We very much appreciate our employees who have volunteered to staff the Food Pantry and the numerous local residents who have donated,"" said Supervisor Morask. For information about these services and any other questions, call 847-297-2510 or visit www.mainetown.com.
MaineStay Youth & Family Services now offers telehealth services exclusively and continues to provide affordable counseling and psychiatric services via video or phone sessions. All fees for counseling services have temporarily been waived due to the financial hardship COVID-19 is causing for so many families. MaineStay has also changed the delivery method of some of their programs such as mentoring and parenting classes into a virtual format."

A total of $436,096 allocated among 29 agencies that provide services to people in Maine Township was approved by the Maine Township Board of Trustees on Dec. 16. Funds come from a line item under the Town Fund of the Maine Township annual budget.
Because of this funding, when a senior needs housing assistance, the help will be there. A drug or alcohol dependent resident will get the counseling needed. A single mother will have daycare services so she can work. These and other services are provided by dozens of social service agencies throughout the area that receive funding from Maine Township.
""As a Township elected official for almost two decades, Agency funding is, in my opinion, the most important function we as a Township provide our residents and illustrates the essence of Township government; direct services to our residents in need.""
Each year agencies are invited to present written applications to the Township for funding. Representatives are required to give a presentation to the Board to answer questions before any financial determinations are made. Township staff members visit agencies to ensure compliance with grant provisions and agencies also submit monthly performance reports. Township also supports these agencies with events and activities such as Agency Day that provides training and networking opportunities for agency representatives.

The views expressed here are the author's own.
Assessor Susan Moylan Krey has reminded senior citizens in Maine Township about good tax news for them thanks to a new law taking effect this year that eliminates the annual renewal requirement for the Senior Exemption. Some seniors may also be eligible for the existing Senior Citizen Tax Deferral Program.
Although senior citizens seeking the Senior Tax Freeze will still need to file renewal forms, they will no longer need to file renewal forms for the Senior Exemption, according to Assessor Krey. The Senior Exemption is available to all homeowners 65 years of age or older, regardless of income. Under the new law, property owners who received the Senior Exemption last year will have it automatically renewed this year. Homeowners who were born in 1954 would have turned 65 in 2019, will have to apply for the Senior Exemption this year.
The Senior Freeze, which must be applied for annually because incomes change from year to year, provides additional tax savings for low- to moderate-income seniors. Any senior who received the Freeze last year must return a renewal application by Feb. 13. Applications for those qualifying for the freeze for the first time are available at Maine Township.
""Last year my office helped over 4,000 residents apply for their exemptions,"" said Assessor Krey. ""We also helped residents with Certificates of Errors which were missed exemptions from previous years which totaled over $800,000 returned to our residents.""
The Senior Citizens Tax Deferral Program, an additional benefit for senior citizens 65 years of age or older who are struggling with property taxes, allows them to defer payment of as much as $5,000 in property taxes until their homes or condominiums are sold. To qualify for the deferral program, seniors must have annual household income of less than $55,000, have equity in their homes that exceeds the sum of property taxes deferred, and have lived in their homes for at least three years. Two-flats and other properties that generate rental income are not eligible for the program. Properties held in a trust are also ineligible, although there are some exceptions to this rule. Applications must be submitted by March 1.
The tax deferral program is essentially a loan from the state that is charged simple interest of 6 percent per year. To assure repayment, a lien is placed on the senior's home that will prevent it from being sold until the loan is paid. Because there are some circumstances where senior citizens might not want a lien on their homes, seniors uncertain about whether to apply contact the Township Assessor's office, but should also consider discussing the matter with legal advisers, financial advisers or family members."

Since Maine Township launched the Coast2Coast Rx Plan six years ago, it has saved township participants more than a million dollars. According to Austin Kelso, Director of General Assistance, the program has typically saved program participants more than $200,000 annually on prescriptions.
All Maine Township residents—regardless of income, age, or health status—are encouraged to save on the cost of their medications through this program. The free prescription drug card offered through Coast2Coast Rx is good for the entire family and may be picked up at Maine Township offices or at participating pharmacies. The card may also be downloaded and printed from www.coast2coastrx.com.
Not insurance—and not intended to replace insurance—the Coast2Coast Rx plan features 59,000 plus participating pharmacies including major chains and most independents, more than 60,000 drugs, and savings of up to 65 percent on brand name generics. The card has no expiration date and may be used as needed—even for pet prescriptions that are filled at a participating pharmacy.
Although the card was originally designed for people without health insurance, all residents should compare pricing whether or not they have insurance, according to Kelso, who said that in in some cases it may offer better pricing than certain health insurance plans. In addition, some medications might not be covered in health plans that are covered by the Coast2Coast Rx card."

Now that the calendar says December, snow cannot be far behind and Maine Township wants residents to be ready for the weather ahead.
Planning ahead for winter can really pay dividends, according to Walter Kazmierczak, Maine Township Highway Commissioner. ""If we all follow these simple rules, it can help make winter less of a burden on all of us,"" he said.
""It is important for residents to observe snow route parking bans that go into effect after two inches of snow,"" said Kazmierczak who added that cars that restrict the Township's ability to plow streets may be ticketed and or towed. He advised residents to use off street parking, if possible.
Residents are also asked to keep sidewalks shoveled to facilitate safe pedestrian traffic and also to make sure that fire hydrants are accessible and visible from the street. However, snow should not be shoveled or blown from private property onto public sidewalks or streets. ""This causes unnecessary hazards and is also subject to tickets or fines,"" said Kazmierczak.
The safety and mobility of all residents depend on easy access to streets and sidewalks, according the highway commissioner, who reminded people that emergency and snow plow vehicles have the right of way. He also cautioned people not to follow a snow plow or a salt truck as weather conditions may make it difficult for the driver to see them."

During the sentencing hearing Wednesday, Oscar Howell was also linked to a prior sex assault of a woman in LaGrange Park in June 2014, prosecutors said.
In both instances, Howell used KIK to lure his victims. He did not use his actual photo and used the screen name, ""thafamousboytrey,"" according to prosecutors.
The Bensenville woman, who was 19 years old at the time she started chatting with Howell via the social media app in April 2014, agreed to meet him outside her home at about 2 a.m. on June 30, 2014, according to a news release from the state's attorney's office. When he arrived, the woman got into his car. Howell kept his face toward the driver's side window, drove to an alley a couple blocks away and then pulled out a knife.
He ordered the woman to get into the backseat of the car, threatening to stab her, and then sexually assaulted her several times, according to prosecutors. Afterward, he drove her home and threatened her so she would not disclose the assault.
The woman did report the assault to the Bensenville Police Department. An investigation lead authorities to Howell, who was taken into custody on April 28, 2016.
He has remained in custody on a $1 million bail and pleaded guilty to an aggravated criminal sexual assault charge on April 9.
Following the incidents, DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin urged area residents to use social media apps ""responsibly.""
""Social media apps can be friendly, good-natured and even helpful when used responsibly,"" Berlin said. ""These same apps however, can be used by sexual predators like Oscar Howell as a hunting ground for their next victim.""
Berlin said video chatting with someone you plan to meet, before meeting in person, is a good idea. Meeting in a public place, telling someone where you are going and never relying on the person you are meeting for transportation are also good tips to follow.
Howell must serve 85 percent of his sentence before being eligible for parole. Once released, he will be required to register as a sex offender for the remainder of his life."

WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Chairman of the House Oversight Economic and Consumer Policy Subcommittee, led two Congressional hearings on Wednesday, July 24 and Thursday, July 25, examining JUUL's role into the skyrocketing e-cigarette use amongst children and teen.
JUUL Labs is the creator of the widely popular e-cigarette device, the JUUL pen, and its flavored nicotine pods. The company has been under growing scrutiny from parents, politicians, and public health advocates for its youth-orientated marketing strategies, which has led to an 80% increase in youth e-cigarette use, or ""vaping"".
During these hearings, high school students, public health advocates, and top executives of JUUL Labs testified under oath.
JUUL sponsored an educational program, in which schools and youth programs were offered grants of $10,000 to $134,000 in exchange for student data and program participation. Students, such as Caleb Mintz, a 17-year old student at one of the six schools that participated in the program, were told by JUUL representatives that the e-cigarettes were ""totally safe"". This runs in contrast to overwhelming scientific evidence that nicotine addiction causes developmental issues in the adolescent brain.
In response, James Monsees, a top executive and co-founder of JUUL Labs, testified that his company never intended for its e-cigarettes to be adopted by underage teens. Monsees also acknowledged Congressman Krishnamoorthi's presentation of statistics that demonstrates an increase in e-cigarette usage to 3.6 million high school and middle school students in 2018, which is 1.5 million students higher than in 2017.
Congressman Krishnamoorthi has pledged to hold accountable anyone who ""knowingly put children in harm's way""."

During his speech at the press conference, Congressman Krishnamoorthi stated, ""In the name of enforcing immigration laws, Donald Trump is trying to change our culture.

More than 600 reusable cotton face masks were handed out at a drive-thru face mask distribution event in Maine Township's parking lot on Saturday, May 30. Maine Township ""Heroes"" Sharon Slobodecki, Carol Szymanski, Joyce Ratliff and Carol Witcher devoted their time to hand sew the much-needed items.
More than 550 seniors picked up a free face mask on Saturday, May 30, when Maine Township and MaineStreamer staff members turned the Township parking lot into a drive-thru face mask distribution center.
Although Illinois residents have been required to wear a mask or face covering in public places and in situations where they are unable to keep their distance from others since May 1, many MaineStreamer members and other seniors have had difficulties acquiring masks, according to Marie Dachniwsky, Director of MaineStreamers, a social group for Maine Township residents 55 years and older.
""This was a huge success and in these times it is so great to see our seniors taking care of other seniors. Plus, they are beautifully made and a true labor of love. Taking care of that vulnerable population is very important to me as well as our entire staff,"" said Supervisor Laura J. Morask."

22,/illinois/desplaines/city-demands-big-tent-revival-attendees-wear-masks,2020-07-30T03:16:24Z,'Big Tent Revival' Attendees Defy City's Mask...,0,39,Eric DeGrechie,Patch Staff,"DES PLAINES, IL — Amid reports of upwards of 150 people gathering without masks at a series of religious activities at the Methodist Campground on East Algonquin Road, the City of Des Plaines is demanding the group follow state COVID-19 mandates. Members of The Last Reformation have been holding ""Big Tent Revival"" events all week with plans to continue through Sunday.
Following an emergency meeting Tuesday night, Mayor Matthew Bogusz signed a revised and updated emergency declaration that according to Alderman Andrew Goczkowski, puts ""Des Plaines' face covering and social distancing requirements a step ahead of Gov. J.B. Pritzker's executive order,"" which includes a broad exemption for the free exercise of religion. The new Des Plaines' declaration is intended to treat all public gatherings equally, according to Goczkowski, whether they are religious in nature or not.
""Failure to do so will result in a citation and fine,"" Goczkowski said. ""Failure to comply after a citation may result in further action.""
According to the city, the fine is $750 for each violation, and it would mount each day.
Torben Sondergaard, organizer of the ""Big Tent Revival"" events, took to social media Wednesday requesting assistance from President Donald Trump. He stated his group will continue congregating and that an ""order is not a law.""
""We have sent a letter to the President of the United States to ask for his help,"" Sondergaard said on Facebook. ""I'm asking all Americans to pray now for a supernatural intervening to stop this Socialist Agenda before we become like China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, or Iran.""
In a video uploaded to YouTube, Sondergaard is seen receiving a notice of the City's executive order from the Des Plaines Police Department.
""It is a crazy world we are living in. You can riot as much as you want. But you can not worship together without masks even on private property,"" said Sondergaard, who claims between 400-500 people have attended each night since last Friday. ""The city has tried everything they can to shut our revival meeting down but couldn't.""
None of the dozens of organizers and attendees seen at the campground Thursday afternoon were wearing masks.
A letter from the city was sent to residents Tuesday acknowledging a number of concerns over the gathering.
""The City had no choice but to issue a tent permit. The Governor exempted religious groups from his order for gathering of 50 people or less,"" Alderman Colt Moylan (Des Plaines Ward 2) said. ""The group is peaceful so far.""
An event permit was not issued to Sondergaard and his group. Sondergaard said Thursday an event permit is not needed for the gathering, only the approved tent permit.
Moylan added that the Des Plaines City Council will talk about the campground at its next meeting on Monday ""to implement certain language so this won't happen again."" He also said police are monitoring the gathering around the clock.
""Our freedom to worship is now being attacked by an overinflated COVID-19 pandemic Trojan horse. It's not OK to allow terrorists to burn our country, shoot innocent people, burn federal buildings, tear down historical statues, capture police stations, but not worship the king Jesus Christ,"" Sondergaard said. ""They are coming for your freedom to worship.""
Claiming ""religious persecution"" from his native Denmark, Sondergaard is reportedly seeking asylum in the United States and has been living with his family in North Carolina since last year. According to a Kickstart campaign for the event, Sondergaard started The Last Reformation in 2011. Similar gatherings are scheduled around the world following the Des Plaines event with a stop in New Hampshire planned for August.
Camilla Johnson, chairman of InsideOut, a Danish anti-cult organization, reached out to Patch regarding Sondergaard's claim of being religiously persecuted in Denmark.
""We simply want to let you know and stress that this claim is not true,"" Johnson said. ""Instead, we do suspect that Torben Sondergaard fraudulently claims he is entitled to asylum in the U.S. and he is using his position as a leader to coerce his followers to comply and participate in this scheme.""
InsideOut helps victims of cults and radical, religious groups, according to its website. It also works with the Danish government, Danish child protection organizations and the Danish media to expose cult leaders and help victims of negative social control in religious communities.
""We know this particular group led by Torben Sondergaard well, for example, for his disregard for the health of others, violent exorcisms to 'purify' sinners, children and the mentally ill included,"" Johnson said. ""Former members have told us stories of TLR leaders and members using their positions of authority to intimidate followers to either comply or be silent when trying to expose this group.""
There have been a number of reports on social media of members of The Last Reformation attempting to ""recruit followers"" at spots around the area and not practicing social distancing guidelines when doing so. On the Kickstart page for the event, Sondergaard states that his group would be sending members ""out on the street.""
Ida Cryes, who says she's a former student of The Last Reformation, told Patch that Sondergaard is ""faking his asylum"" as there's no law in Denmark or persecution.
Residents have been making posts to Facebook expressing their frustration with city officials and the group. Here are a few posts:
