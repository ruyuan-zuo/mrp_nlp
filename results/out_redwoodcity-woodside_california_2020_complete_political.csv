Gavin Newsom announced a $42 million statewide effort Monday to support Child Protective Services casework during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
With schools closed during the pandemic and statewide orders tore main indoors as much as possible, Child Protective Services activities like in-person visits and responding to referrals from teachers and others who frequently interact with children have been significantly limited, Newsom said.
The funding will support things like social worker outreach, family resource centers, county-level child protection programs and more resources for state Health and Human Services workers in order to support the roughly 86,500 children in the state's welfare system, including about 59,000in the foster care system, according to Newsom.
""When the schools are closed, that's another point of contact where people are able to make referrals based upon the interaction of children, interactions of school nurses to one another, interactions with our caregivers, not least of which our teachers,"" he said.
""Those referrals are down. Those in-home visits are down as a consequence of the virus.
""The state is providing about $40.6 million of the $42 million effort.

More than half of the total funding will be used to send $200 per month to families that are deemed ""at risk"" to help them buy groceries and other necessities.
""It absolutely is an investment on a continuum to support both families at risk and our system, as well as those who are currently serving as resource families for our foster youth across the state,"" state Director of Social Services Kim Johnson said.
Public health officials across the state have confirmed 22,348cases of the virus, including 687 deaths.
There were also 3,015 people hospitalized due to the virus, 1,178 of whom were in intensive care, as of Sunday night, according to Newsom.

City officials completed an evaluation of parking enforcement standards and plan to refocus their efforts on education while issuing tickets for parking violations that represent an immediate safety concern, such as improperly parking in a handicapped or red zone.
Citation issuance is already down 40 percent since the pandemic began, compared to the same period in 2019, according to the city.
The enforcement changes will take effect Thursday. As of Monday, the city is also suspending enforcement of metered parking, street sweeping, residential parking and expired registration.
As a result, residents who received one of the 1,241 parking tickets issued between March 17 and Wednesday will have their citations dismissed or refunded.
The city will contact affected residents and no action is required on the part of residents.
Residents with questions can contact the city's traffic unit at traffic@cityofsanmateo.org.

When Governor Newsom first announced California's Shelter in Place directive, one of the questions he was asked led to him explaining that it was still OK to have a barbecue with your family in your backyard. Today, listening to New York's Governor Cuomo talk about going to a family birthday party and social distancing six feet away from each other, I had to wonder if we are misunderstanding social distancing.
As the recent paper by Sima Asadi, Nicole Bouvier, Anthony S. Wexler & William D. Ristenpart (2020) on Covid-19 transmission: The coronavirus pandemic and aerosols: Does COVID-19 transmit via expiratory particles? In Aerosol Science and Technology, DOI: 10.1080/02786826.2020.1749229 notes:
""modeling [from China] indicated that 79% of the actual documented cases were infected by undocumented individuals. Furthermore, inspection of the average delay time between infection and initial manifestation of symptoms led them to conclude that ""…pre-symptomatic shedding [of virus] may be typical among documented cases""
In addition,
""given the large numbers of expiratory particles known to be emitted during breathing and speech, and given the clearly high transmissibility of COVID-19, a plausible and important hypothesis is that a face-to-face conversation with an asymptomatic infected individual, even if both individuals take care not to touch, might be adequate to transmit COVID-19.""
Essentially, they conclude ""that speech plausibly serves as an important and under-recognized transmission mechanism for COVID-19.""
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2020.1749229
The reality is that social distancing may not be enough. While:
""Direct or indirect 'contact' modes require a susceptible individual to physically touch themselves with, for example, a virus-contaminated hand; 'direct' indicates that person-to-person contact transfers the virus between infected and susceptible hosts (such as by a handshake), while 'indirect' implies transmission via a 'fomite,' which is an object like a hand-rail or paper tissue that has been contaminated with infectious virus. ""
Aerosol transmission takes that further and says when you speak and emit this virus, this virus is alive and able to infect a new host for as far as it moves in the air and says alive which may be in the case of COVID-19 as long as an hour.
In addition, Dr. Lydia Bourouiba, PhD from MIT has found:
""Owing to the forward momentum of the cloud, pathogen-bearing droplets are propelled much farther than if they were emitted in isolation without a turbulent puff cloud trapping and carrying them forward. Given various combinations of an individual patient's physiology and environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, the gas cloud and its payload of pathogen-bearing droplets of all sizes can travel 23 to 27 feet (7-8 m)"" https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852?appId=scweb
Are we really going to be able to social distance 23 to 27 feet?
Which brings us to masks. Having traveled to China a fair amount, I know that a lot of people use a mask there when they are personally sick as a polite way of protecting others from their own infection. In addition, my work at AirSpeQ, an air pollution sensor company, has taken me to several aerosol and air pollution conferences including the first ever world air pollution conference organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva about eighteen months ago in Geneva. At both conferences the experts were clear, masks don't do very much.
A recent small study from Korea notes:
""During respiratory viral infection, face masks are thought to prevent transmission……Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered SARS–CoV-2 during coughs by infected patients. Prior evidence that surgical masks effectively filtered influenza virus (1) informed recommendations that patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear face masks to prevent transmission (2). However, the size and concentrations of SARS–CoV-2 in aerosols generated during coughing are unknown. Oberg and Brousseau (3) demonstrated that surgical masks did not exhibit adequate filter performance against aerosols measuring 0.9, 2.0, and 3.1 μm in diameter. Lee and colleagues (4) showed that particles 0.04 to 0.2 μm can penetrate surgical masks. The size of the SARS–CoV particle from the 2002–2004 outbreak was estimated as 0.08 to 0.14 μm (5); assuming that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar size, surgical masks are unlikely to effectively filter this virus.""
(https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2764367/effectiveness-surgical-cotton-masks-blocking-sars-cov-2-controlled-comparison_)
I realize that the WHO is now in process of changing its guidance but unfortunately, the reality is that the science isn't there yet and people rarely wear masks properly. Additionally, if you are already sick with a respiratory disease and having trouble breathing normally, wearing a mask only makes the problem worse for you from the point of view of your own health. Moreover, if by wearing a mask you get overconfident and become more willing to go out and less careful about social distancing any benefits may be lost. So yes, like social distancing, masks help but they are no panacea.
At this point, the debate about how far to distance from each other and whether or not to use masks, may not be the best way to think about exposure. They each help but not that much. The better way may be to think in terms of petri dishes. Who do you want and trust in your own petri dish? There have been numerous articles as well as explanations from government officials including California Governor Newsom, New York Governor Cuomo and Dr. Anthony Fauci at the Federal level as to how the virus moves person to person.
As we have now seen cruise ships are the real-world human equivalents of petri dishes in the lab: contained environments that one can use to grow cultures be it COVID-19, H1N1 or any other germ or virus. Staying six feet away from someone who speaks and ejects viruses into the air, unless you are downwind from them, doesn't really help. Using a mask may reduce the virus' ability to travel through air but is not likely to be a guarantee. The only thing that really works in this scenario is simply not to be in the same petri dish, not at home, not when you are out shopping for food, and certainly not in a hospital or already contaminated environment. Create your own effective petri dish of people and places you are willing to be in and don't go outside it. If you don't believe it can be done on a nationwide basis just look at New Zealand. They were able to close their borders, quarantine and stop the virus. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/new-zealand-isnt-just-flattening-the-curve-its-squashing-it/2020/04/07/6cab3a4a-7822-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html
I doubt however that the US can become its own petri dish a la New Zealand. In which case, we will have to wait for mass immunity which involves a fair number of deaths or a vaccine which is about twelve to eighteen months out. Our personal outcomes will be determined by how many other people and how much air by design or not, we let into our personal petri dish. So create your own petri dish."

It is truly hard to fathom but the John Hopkins database has just hit one million cases and that that it is probably more due to underreporting and lack of tests than to the fact that we really just hit that number. Yes, we now know that at least eighty percent of confirmed cases do not need hospitalization, that about fifteen percent will need hospitalization, and five percent will need ventilators.
Individual states have raced around instituting variations of shelter at home, shelter in place, do not travel, pause programs under whatever name and description they think is most appropriate for anywhere from two weeks to eight weeks. Nonetheless, it is clear that so many lives could have been saved by having one national program in place.
The purported economic harm that some people have been making noise about makes one think that the choice is between a vibrant economy and lives, when as Mr. Afuko Addo, President of Ghana, has been quoted as saying ""we know how to bring the economy back to life. What we do not know is how to bring people back to life."" The reality is that if you are dead, you don't really care what the state of the economy is.
As someone who is based out of the US, although Europe as in Italy, Spain, Germany and France, has actually outpaced the US in infections and deaths, this isn't in any way comforting. As already pointed out Italy, Spain, Germany and France have yet to see the outrageous spike in layoffs that the US has. Not only have applications for unemployment hit over six million but the punditry and government officials act like the current healthcare system isn't half of the problem. For small main street businesses that must continue to pay healthcare expenses even when they aren't open for business, the double whammy means that it is simply easier to layoff employees then to carry the healthcare expense for the unknown length of time this epidemic might run.
As noted above different states are implementing stay at home / social distancing directives of different lengths, the longest of which is Virginia's June 10th; however the models being presented by different groups including those by the Gates Foundation only show the epidemic flattening out late summer and potentially flatlining for quite some time after. We are way too early to really now for sure. Unfortunately, small businesses need to make decisions now.
It would be nice as New York Governor Cuomo outlined in his daily press conference yesterday to emerge from this pandemic with a more resilient economy that includes intergovernmental coordination, more tele-medicine and tele-education and even more local medical suppliers, researchers and first responders. We have a choice. Transformation could be negative but it doesn't have to be. We should be able to learn, grow and find the silver lining in this horribly dark cloud."

The Koch brothers and Trump wanted to reopen the country and the economy to ensure that the stock market shot back up and everyone went to mass on Easter Sunday. But is that really what the country needs right now? First Governor Cuomo of NY extended the NY PAUSE directive through April 15th. Then Trump finally agreed that the earliest we can start trying to reopen is April 30th. Today, Governor Northam of Virginia lapped them for the win with a stay at home order through June 10th .(https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-55-Temporary-Stay-at-Home-Order-Due-to-Novel-Coronavirus-(COVID-19).pdf )
At some point however, we will have to start considering what it will take to reopen the country not so much in terms of date but in terms of process. One of the proposals has as its lead author, Scott Gottlieb, a former Trump FDA commissioner.
https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/national-coronavirus-response-a-road-map-to-reopening/
The report lays out four phases:
Phase 1: which we are all in right now and has as its goal providing an increase in hospital critical care beds and an increase of testing to 750,000 people a week to track the epidemic.
Phase 2: A state sees a sustained reduction in new cases for at least 14 days, and its hospitals are able to provide care without being overwhelmed.
Phase 3: The nation has a vaccine or drugs to treat covid-19 in place and the government launches mass vaccinations.
Phase 4: The nation starts rebuilding its capacity to deal with the next pandemic by building up its scientific and public health infrastructure.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/29/coronavirus-strategy-economy-plan/
Sounds reasonable enough until you realize that getting to Phase 2 could be very easy to achieve by simply no longer reporting the true numbers. When Chinese officials faced pressure to reopen the economy, magically the numbers improved almost overnight which is why informed people had trouble understanding them.
As the NY Times has noted in China:
""Hospitals could input patients' details into a computer and instantly notify government health authorities in Beijing, where officers are trained to spot and smother contagious outbreaks before they spread.
It didn't work.
After doctors in Wuhan began treating clusters of patients stricken with a mysterious pneumonia in December, the reporting was supposed to have been automatic. Instead, hospitals deferred to local health officials who, over a political aversion to sharing bad news, withheld information about cases from the national reporting system — keeping Beijing in the dark and delaying the response.""
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html
If we want the same thing to happen here, this is the way to do it. Incentivize public officials and hospital administrators to stop telling the truth.
Think this isn't going to happen. We already we have the following articles
https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/17/metro/mass-official-coronavirus-count-is-197-experts-say-true-number-could-now-be-high-6000/
https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-10/us-coronavirus-cases-far-above-official-tally-scientists
Dr. Fauci has explained and Governor Cuomo has stated that right now we are behind the eight ball. In other words, the virus is setting the timeline. Essentially Governor Northam acknowledged that by setting a more realistic timetable ten weeks out. Thinking that we can set a shorter timeline assumes we have answers to a lot of questions. The reality is that we still don't know how to stop the virus. Maybe we will get lucky and the virus will turn out not to like warm weather. However, if that is not the case; the Chinese example not to mention the Italian example would lead one to believe that Governor Northam's order is the most appropriate. It will surely be quickly adopted by a lot of states.
Our ability to get to phase 2 depends on whether we are able to test enough people to make quarantine and isolation decisions based on tests but even more importantly on whether or not getting the disease once really provides immunity to the disease for the individual going forward. I don't think we really know enough about either aspect. The first assumes that the person cannot test negative even though he/she is a carrier. The second assumes that antibodies will remain in an individual and protect that individual going forward. The newspapers are full of cases of someone who tests negative first and then tests positive. The assumption is that the individual got the virus between the two events. However, that is really only an assumption and it may prove to be wrong. In addition, there have already been cases of reinfection in China which is why China closed its borders. It is hard to know whether in the cases of reinfection, the body hadn't produced enough antibodies or whether the virus mutated enough to work around the former antibodies.
As Governor Cuomo noted this morning, healthcare workers are our soldiers in this fight we need to support them in any way we can through this first critical phase 1. We need to get them sufficient personal protective equipment so that they do not get infected. We need to get them more support as in more healthcare workers so that the ones on the frontline don't collapse from exhaustion. And just as importantly, we need to admire and thank them for their efforts.
At this point moving to Phase 2 is the goal. When we can get there we can then start trying to get ahead of the virus with proper planning for Phase 3 and Phase 4.
E pluribus unum!"
5,/california/redwoodcity-woodside/dear-governor-cuomo,2020-03-29T17:05:31Z,Dear Governor Cuomo,1,0,Tania Solé,Community Contributor,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
Dear Governor Cuomo,
On March 20th, I stumbled onto your live press conference on the PAUSE being implemented in NY. I was impressed with your comments about bad information among young people. You stated they think: ""'I can't get it.' Yeah. That is wrong. That is wrong. That young people can't get it. THAT IS WRONG. It is not a factual statement. 20% of coronavirus cases according to the CDC ages 20-44. OK. France more than 50% of coronavirus cases in ICU under 60 years old. You can get it! ….""
It was nice to see someone come out with a direct statement ""That is wrong."" And repeat it three times each time more emphatically.
This Saturday March 28th, I made a concerted effort to listen into your coronavirus update hoping to be just as impressed if not more. ( https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-moving-new-york You are getting so much good press.) Sadly, just a couple of minutes into your press conference, I was stumped. How could you, Mr. Facts / Mr. Reality, be saying that in perspective China's coronavirus epidemic had started twelve weeks ago. For a second there I thought I had tuned into an old press conference, you surely couldn't be speaking live. I was wrong. You were speaking live on March 28th. However, if we are going to be giving facts then let's give the correct facts. The first case in Wuhan, China was traced back to November 17th, that is closer to 19 weeks ago. Yes, it is true the doctors in Wuhan didn't notify their equivalent of the CDC for another four weeks but then they didn't realize that this was the beginning of a pandemic. It took them about four weeks to do so. Finally Chinese officials acknowledged the pandemic on December 31st. Nonetheless, to contextualize a New York State first case as being only 27 days ago, you need to compare it if anything really to the first case in Wuhan.
Why do I care? Because the step everyone is now trying to talk about is when do we reopen the economy and/or the country? Well if the coronavirus cycles through NY the way it did in Wuhan, you should realize that Wuhan is just barely now beginning to lift restrictions a full 19 weeks after the first case. So yes, Governor Cuomo this is a marathon not a sprint. But just to be clear this is a full marathon, not a half marathon. NY and really the US is maybe four weeks into this at least 19 week cycle.
You go on to talk about testing but some of your ideas seem a bit flawed. Yes, a lot depends on whether we are able to test enough people to make quarantine and isolation decisions based on tests but even more importantly on whether or not getting the disease once really provides immunity to the disease for the individual going forward. I don't think we really know enough about either aspect. The first assumes that the person cannot test negative even though he/she is a carrier. The second assumes that antibodies will remain in an individual and protect that individual going forward. The newspapers are full of cases of someone who tests negative first and then tests positive. The assumption is that the individual got the virus between the two events. But that is really only an assumption and it may prove to be wrong. In addition, there have already been cases of reinfection and it is hard to know whether there weren't enough antibodies present or whether the virus mutated enough to work around the former antibodies. Reminds me of the fact that the flu mutates year to year which is why people require new updated flu vaccines. Not to mention that even if Wuhan is now lifting some restrictions; China, in fact, is closing its borders out of concern for reinfections.
But getting back to basics Governor. I know you want to be positive. I know you want to reopen the economy and the country. But just like the young people partying on the beaches in Florida and elsewhere, you are wrong to think this is going to be a half marathon. This really is a full marathon! In fact today you extended the New York PAUSE to April 15th.
I hope you, New York State and the country have the patience, more like the endurance, to face the harsh realities that it will require to finish in one piece. Yes, we are all in this together. We are going to get through this and get back to whatever we were doing before. But as you put it, if we use this time well like for example to reconnect with family, talk to one another and have Sunday dinner together, it will have been priceless.
""Excelsior. E pluribus unum.""

Dear Mr. President,
The news is getting worse and worse by the day. Today was quite a double whammy! We now have according to the John Hopkins coronavirus tracker (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 ) the distinction of being number 1, number 1, in worldwide confirmed cases (do I really trust the Chinese numbers, I am not sure but nonetheless this is nothing to dismiss.)
In addition, we learned earlier today that over 3.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment. That number actually dwarfs the numbers during the 2008-2009 recession. And of course, it doesn't include all those who are self-employed and cannot file for unemployment. A much larger number today than during the recession. Do you really believe that all those people will be rehired or able to support themselves by Easter? Yes, they may still go and fill the churches but they won't be there out of joy they will be there for the comfort that at moments like these only religion can provide.
If you really think that the best thing is to reopen the country for Easter, please go ahead and do so. It won't be the people who understand and apply science in their daily lives who will die, it will be your followers who deluded by your magnificence will as you have alluded to allow themselves to be shot by you. Or those in desperate circumstances that no longer really care what the outcome is. But is that really what you want to do? I thought you wanted to win in November. Ensuring that 5-10% of your voters die before they cast their votes for you is no way to win an election.
The fact is that the Imperial College report ( https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf ) clearly states:
""The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package – or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission – will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) – given that we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed. ""
Bold is mine: 18 months! November is slightly over eight months away. Over three million people are now desperate and probably going to have to take jobs on what to do are the frontlines namely Amazon delivery and supermarket stocking such as at chains like Safeway.
Most experts are expecting at least another month of increasingly worse numbers. In any case, the Imperial College report continues:
""We show that intermittent social distancing – triggered by trends in disease surveillance – may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound.""
Even China, five months into the process, is now closing its borders due to a fear of reinfection from the outside. We are barely one month into testing and identifying how the virus is beginning to move through our population. Do you really want the virus coming back in October just as people are starting to vote? I wouldn't think so but maybe you know better.
Later in the paper they suggest:
""In the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour, we would expect a peak in mortality (daily deaths) to occur after approximately 3 months….. 2.2 million in the US, not accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems being overwhelmed on mortality.""
And that doesn't even account for deaths due to unemployment or underemployment, surely the next wave.
One last quick thought: I would also suggest you reconsider who your friends are. Is Fox TV really your friend? Murdock cancelled his birthday party:
""But one elderly Fox News viewer, a crucial supporter of President Trump, took the threat seriously: The channel's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who was to celebrate his 89th birthday on March 11.
On March 8, as the virus was spreading, the Murdoch family called off a planned party out of concern for the patriarch's health, according to a person familiar with the cancellation. There were about 20 people on the guest list.""
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/media/fox-news-coronavirus-rupert-murdoch.html
They know the danger is real. So why would the network claim that you need to reopen the country for economic reasons? Maybe they aren't really as supportive as you think. Maybe they don't want you to get re-elected. When you assume that, all of a sudden their calls to reopen the economy make sense. Let your supporters die and you won't get reelected. You really ought to start thinking through what your supposed advisors are blaring at you. They may not be the supporters you thought they were.
Take care, Mr. President, your decisions today could make a big difference in November. I am sure you recognize that.
Sincerely,
Tania Sole"

The board provided $3 million in seed funding to the San Mateo County Strong Fund, which will support residents, non-profit organizations and small businesses that are particularly hard hit by the outbreak.
The fund is also accepting donations from residents at SMCStrong.org.
""We know that many of our neighbors are being hit hard financially by layoffs, cutbacks in hours and shutdowns,"" Board of Supervisors President Warren Slocum said.
""We ask that anyone who has the means to help today to make a donation right away.""
The fund will assist residents afford household necessities and help small businesses and nonprofits maintain their staffs and operating expenses, according to the board.
The board used revenue from 2016's Measure K, a voter-approved half-cent local sales tax extension, to launch the fund. Donations and fully tax deductible and all money donated to the fund will remain in San Mateo County, according to the board.
""For too many of my constituents right now, April's rent payment is simply out of reach,"" Supervisor David Canepa said.
""We are standing up to this moment in time by taking unprecedented actions to protect us all. But mark my words, this is just the beginning.""
The board also plans to launch a parallel fund with the San Mateo County Economic Development Association and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation that will seek donations from the county's large companies and philanthropic organizations.
""Every city, school district, hospital, companies of all sizes, chambers of commerce, and legions of volunteers have come together to make sure we weather the crisis and come out stronger on the other side -- that's what makes San Mateo County special,"" Slocum said.

The Board of Supervisors meets at 9 a.m. Tuesday in the board chambers at the Hall of Justice in Redwood City.
""Our county's most vulnerable residents and small businesses have been hit the hardest by this crisis,"" County Manager Mike Callagy said in a news release. ""The impacts from COVID-19 have been swift and far-reaching.""
The emergency eviction ban is intended to protect renters in the 105,000 rental units countywide from being evicted as they deal with lost work hours and health concerns during the shelter in place order.
""Job loss, cutbacks in work hours, staying home with school-age children, caring for a stricken loved one, or becoming ill with the disease would qualify under the emergency protections,"" the county said.
County departments are developing a process for renters to petition landlords for rent relief, officials said.
If the emergency order is approved, tenants would be liable for back rent 180 days following the termination of the emergency. Supervisors and the county manager will review the emergency regulation as needs dictate.
The San Mateo County Strong Fund would provide $3 million in emergency aid to assist prescreened individuals and families; small businesses; and nonprofit organizations that serve the community's most vulnerable residents, the board said.
Funds would come from Measure K, a half-cent, voter-approved sales tax extension and would be administered by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The foundation would seek additional donors and the fund would only be available to San Mateo County residents, nonprofits and businesses.
The county, the foundation and the San Mateo County Economic Development Association are creating a website where donors can add to the fund and those in need can apply for assistance.
""San Mateo County's residents and businesses, and especially our small businesses and sole proprietors who do not qualify for unemployment benefits, are reeling from this crisis,"" said Rosanne Foust, SAMCEDA president and CEO.
The Board of Supervisors meeting will not be open to the public die to the shelter in place order, but a video broadcast will be available at sanmateocounty.legistar.com. Comments can be submitted by email to boardfeedback@smcgov.org.

The council will hold a study session that will give lawmakers direction on a future ordinance banning the sale of flavored tobacco and electronic cigarette devices.
Should Redwood City councilmembers proceed with the proposal, they would be following a growing trend.
Last summer San Francisco became the first city in the United States to ban the sale of electronic cigarettes.
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors followed suit in November banning the sale of e-cigarettes in unincorporated areas.
Cities throughout the Bay Area including Danville have adopted similar measures. Pleasanton councilmembers are considering a similar proposal.
If it enacts such a measure, Redwood City would join San Carlos, South San Francisco, Burlingame, Half Moon Bay, Menlo Park and Portola Valley in doing so, the Daily Journal report said.
If councilmembers approve the proposal, the city's 16 tobacco and vaping stores along with other businesses selling e-cigarettes that continue selling flavored tobacco products would face fines along with the prospect of having their tobacco retail license revoked, according to the Daily Journal, which cites a city staff report.

Bear with me as I tell you the story of a costly local neighborhood saga, I promise it will make sense and in fact end up being the likely pre-cursor of what is about to unfold regarding police processes in Redwood City.
Ten years ago, I moved to Redwood City to live at Docktown on the water. At the time, I thought Redwood City was moving towards creating what at the time was colloquially referred to as Sausalito of the South Bay. I was excited and looked forward to creating a green, environmentally sensitive community that would help the City of Redwood City lead the way in creating and expanding housing solutions that were responsive to problems such as sea level rise. In the last ten years, London has moved to create floating communities (https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/02/15/london-floating-homes-osm.cnn); Amsterdam's IJBurg (https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/about-amsterdam/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/ijburg) floating neighborhood has been featured worldwide as a model for other such projects and Dubai is in the midst of creating a floating neighborhood modeled on Venice (https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/dubai-floating-venice-resort/index.html). Not to mention the work of people like Giancarlo Zema (https://www.giancarlozema.com/ ) and Koen Olthuis (https://www.waterstudio.nl/ .)
While originally a private marina, through a number of unanticipated and convoluted events, Docktown ended up being managed directly by the City of Redwood City. The city claimed and in fact the army general they hired to manage the marina informed the residents that they wanted to create a ""gem"" on the water a la Koen Olthuis. In supposed support of this goal, the city started a very detailed Inner Harbor Visioning process. That process ended up including over ten meetings over the course of almost one year (https://www.redwoodcity.org/departments/community-development-department/planning-housing/planning-services/general-plan-precise-plans/inner-harbor-specific-plan). However when the visioning recommendations of the Inner Harbor Task Force were seen not to be aligning with what the City Manager and City Council had quite clearly predetermined they wanted as an outcome, the process and the final report were stopped in their tracks. Instead city representatives pointed to the California State Lands commission, to the state legislature and to other government bodies as having jurisdiction and not allowing any of the work to be acted up on. The City produced it's own specific plan and today Docktown is a ghost of itself. A large proportion of residents ended up being bought out at a cost so far of over $20M to the taxpayers when only spending $2-3M would have created a ""gem"" that would have been a beacon for the area.
So why do I bring this up now?
Watching what the country is going through now as regards the murder of George Floyd, you would think that the City of Redwood City would take advantage and take the opportunity to lead as regards budgeting and policing. Instead just the way Redwood City was ahead of the curve with Docktown and is now instead behind the times; the events this week reminded me of what is likely to be the reality ten years from now regarding local policing. The City Council's tone deaf attitude regarding budgeting was not an auspicious beginning. While I do realize that local government budgets are set month's in advance; Covid19 has forced local and state governments to quickly pivot, make cuts and reimagine original plans. Add the new civil unrest and calls for reallocating funds away from the police not to say defund or abolish police departments and you would have thought the Council would have understood that proposing a budget that actually increased the budget of the police department would be inflammatory. But not in Redwood City.
Council members will try to continue as they always have. Who cares about budget concerns, internal staff raises were approved regardless of everything going on. Council members are telling everyone they are listening and welcome residents' input. During Wednesday's Special Council Meeting/Townhall with the Chief of Police, Chief Mulholland, explained that in comparison to other areas of the country Redwood City is ahead in the sense that what is in the calls for further improvements are items that are already in process; he deflected all calls for further improvements by pointing to City Council and state regulations. Next, City Council members will also point the finger at the state.
The City is acting like they are at the forefront of the policing issue and that there is nothing relevant locally. Watching Chief Mulholland last night go through how the City is already doing what it can in reference to each of the 8ToAbolish agenda items was to have a flashback to Bill Ekern presenting to the Inner Harbor Visioning meetings. In addition, to watch Mayor Diane Howard read a prepared response to a supposed public question meant that they had all already been given the questions that formed the main part of the event. It was truly horrifying.
As one member from the public reminded the council, this is an election year. Rest assured it won't be long before there will be a long visioning process outlined. Residents will spends hours and hours preparing and discussing all kinds of real positive change and then after about a year (not too long after the election actually) everything will all of a sudden be stopped and the City Council will continue as it always has and feels it can continue to do. By simply not keeping up with the times and compounding that with eliminating some of the good in the system, Redwood City will likely actually go backward instead of forward and certainly be far outpaced by other cities and communities.
I hope I am wrong, but I doubt it."
21,/california/redwoodcity-woodside/smc-supes-vote-allocation-2m-child-care-funds,2020-07-21T18:26:15Z,SMC Supes To Vote On Allocation of $2M In Child...,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"SAN MATEO COUNTY, CA — San Mateo County's Board of Supervisors will vote on Tuesday whether to approve a $2 million allocation of federal funds to support child care programs impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
If approved, this Child Care Relief Fund will provide $1.35 million to child care centers through grants of up to $55,000 each, and $650,000 to family child care homes through grants of up to $10,000 each.
The money is from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act approved by Congress in March. The funding will help counter the economic burden of lost revenue and increased costs that child care programs face.
A survey by the San Mateo County COVID-19 Child Care Response Team found that 42 percent of family child care homes and 71 percent of care centers expect net income loss in the fall.
A shortage of child care spaces in San Mateo County could restrict parents and caregivers from working, potentially resulting in up to $3.6 billion in lost wages in the county.
Grants will be distributed in collaboration with the San Mateo Credit Union and the Community Equity Collaborative, a Menlo Park-based working group that supports equity in education.
The county will prioritize funding child care programs that serve vulnerable residents. San Diego and Santa Clara counties have also allocated CARES Act funds to support child care.
San Mateo County's relief fund represents 1.5 percent of the county's $134 million CARES Act funds.
The Board of Supervisors will vote on the child care funding proposal at Tuesday's meeting, which begins at 9 a.m. Remote access is available via Zoom at https://smcgov.zoom.us/j/94893699088.

22,/california/redwoodcity-woodside/san-mateo-county-supes-push-telecommuting,2020-06-30T22:30:08Z,San Mateo County Supes Push For Telecommuting,0,1,Bay City News,News Partner,"SAN MATEO COUNTY, CA — The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to encourage all employers in the county to offer employees the option to work from home and telecommute when feasible.
Supervisors David Canepa and Warren Slocum co-sponsored a resolution, which the board unanimously approved, encouraging telecommuting in an effort to tackle multiple problems.
Residents working from home, Canepa and Slocum argued, can protect themselves from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic while also minimizing traffic congestion and reducing carbon emissions from their vehicles.
Canepa noted that the American Lung Association gave the county an ""F"" for its particulate pollution and a ""B"" for ozone pollution prior to the pandemic.
However, he argued, following local health orders to stay home during the pandemic could have lasting positive results in the form of reducing pollution in the Bay Area.
""There's a big lesson to learn here: do we return to gridlock or do we look at what is working now ... to come up with new innovative policies to protect the environment,"" Canepa said.
Slocum argued that local employers should take a cue from technology companies in Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area who have expanded telecommuting opportunities. In May, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told employees they could continue working from home permanently.
""I think it's important that San Mateo County, that we demonstrate leadership on this issue,"" Slocum said. San Mateo County Health Chief Louise Rogers told the board that the county is seeing a rise in coronavirus cases that is similar to other parts of the Bay Area that have begun reopening.
The county's 14-day average testing positivity rate is at 4 percent while the rest of the Bay Area is at 3.4 percent, according to Rogers. A large number of the county's 3,232 coronavirus cases and 108 deaths are also associated with congregate care facilities and nursing homes.
Rogers added that movement among members of the public has quantifiably reduced and still remains well below what it was before the state and local shelter-in-place orders went into effect in March. While use of public transit has risen since early June, Rogers said, it is still more than 60 percent below the county's baseline prior to the pandemic.
""We've expected, as society loosens, that people will be moving around, we'll see a lot of that activity,"" Rogers said. ""The question in whether we will observe, in our community, that people are respecting the guidance about wearing face coverings, about observing physical distance of at least 6 feet, about avoiding crowds.""
""If we don't respect all of those behaviors, we're going to start to see more of a taking off of the numbers that we've now seen in other states,"" she said.

Full disclosure, I hate masks. Full disclosure when masks became mandatory on the streets in San Mateo county, I chose to reduce my street usage. Full disclosure, I just traveled to Taiwan where masks are required on public transportation such as subways and buses. Yes, I rode the subway. Yes, I wore a mask. But given the choice between staying home and wearing a mask, I usually choose to stay home.
Regardless of my feelings, as a marketing professional, the part I have not been able to understand is why it is marketed as a benefit for others. Medical professionals and first responders don't wear masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect others, they wear it to protect themselves. Yet for some reason, the geniuses in marketing have chosen to market your decision or requirement to wear a mask as a benefit for your mother, your friend, your senior relative, essentially everybody but you the mask wearer.
I understand that back in the early days of the pandemic there was a shortage of masks and PPE so of course the last thing the authorities wanted to do was create an even bigger panic by explaining that everyone should wear a mask. Which is why the messaging was so wishy washy. Yes, if you could, if you had one available, wear a mask. Not exactly the type of messaging to get everyone on board and supportive day one. But now six months later? While medical grade masks are still in relatively short supply, cloth masks are easily available not only in a basic black style but in all kinds of colors and designs from low cost to designer priced and branded.
So why hasn't the marketing changed?
The messaging is still: wear a mask to protect others. Little wonder that a president thinks that getting those that meet him to test for Covid19 is enough protection. But the reality is that testing for Covid19 is not very reliable, and even more importantly is not a prophylactic. Not wearing a mask and getting tested daily is essentially the equivalent of having unprotected sex and checking to see if the woman got pregnant after each time. Twenty-nine days out of the month it works and the result comes back negative but eventually without fail the result will change and a positive result will ensue.

Approves Aid To SCU Lightning Fire Victims,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA — After nearly a month-long wait, Santa Clara County was approved for federal aid on Tuesday to support residents impacted by the SCU Lighting Complex fires that started last month.
The blazes have burned for 41 days and are now 98 percent contained and burned nearly 400,000 acres, making it the third-largest wildfire in state history to date.
The SCU Lightning Complex fires destroyed 222 structures, virtually all in Santa Clara County, and cost ranchers and residents nearly $26 million in damage, according to a report from the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, a statewide network of UC researchers and educators who focus on the creation, development and application of agriculture, natural and human resources.
""I am relieved that Santa Clara County residents will have access to federal funding to help them recover from this disaster,"" Cortese said in a statement.
""Although the SCU Fire area was not as populated as other fire areas, the damage is devastating to cattle ranchers who have lost grazing land, their homes and livelihoods.""
The $26 million from the UC report is an initial estimate damage assessment and accounts for the loss of cattle and vegetation on grazing lands. It, however, does not account for the loss of roads, cabins, barns and other buildings so the total damage cost is likely much higher.
The report also highlights that water quality and quantity in the Calaveras and San Antonio reservoirs will suffer.
Cortese toured the impacted fire areas in the Diablo Range of the county beyond Lick Observatory and the San Antonio Valley.
A statement from Cortese's office said he saw ""black-scorched earth has replaced vibrant grasslands, shrubs and oak trees that provided feed and shelter to 13,471 head of cattle and livelihoods to the ranchers who raised them.""
The blaze damaged acres of County Parks and land on Mt. Hamilton while displacing local workers like heavy equipment operators. It also destroyed water tanks, private and public power lines and utilities as well as communication systems.
With the new Federal Emergency Management Agency approval, Santa Clara joins eight other California counties approved for federal aid by a Presidential Disaster Declaration on Aug. 22.
The declaration helps people in impacted counties be eligible for support such as financial reimbursements, crisis counseling, housing and unemployment service as well as legal services.
FEMA aid can also provide psychological support to the thousands of residents who were impacted by evacuation orders.
Residents in need of FEMA aid can apply at fema.gov/disaster/4558. More fire services and information is available on Cortese's website at https://www.sccgov.org/sites/d3/fire/Pages/home.aspx.

The revised budget, which will be considered by the board at its Sept. 29 meeting, includes a 16 percent hike in spending from the budget recommendations that were proposed in June, according to county officials. Officials announced in a news release that the increases in spending will address the impacts of the pandemic's shutdown and the need for more funds to go toward increased public health and safety programs.
County officials indicated that the $180 million in pandemic-related spending includes personal protection equipment, shelter facilities, health care costs, staffing and telecommuting costs. According to release, the county has received $134 million in federal CARES money, $24.8 million of which was spent in fiscal year 2019-20.
Due to the pandemic, the county has claimed $39 million and received and spent $18.6 million in FEMA funding in the previous fiscal year. County officials anticipating claiming at least $48 million in FEMA dollars due to the pandemic and the CZU Lightning Complex fires in fiscal year 2020-21.
In response, county officials have put off several capital spending projects — including for energy upgrades and building renovations, which led to an estimated $49.5 million rollover of unspent funds from the previous fiscal year, the county announced.
In June, San Mateo County Manager Mike Callagy told the board that he expected the proposed budget to undergo substantial changes. At the time, he estimated those changes and told the board that the county was forecasting a shortfall of between $65 million and $100 million due to lost taxes and realignment issues.
County officials have announced that the updated approved recommended budget will include $16.8 million in county cost reductions, $12 million in capital project deferrals, $61 million in Prop. 72 and realignment revenue reductions and $20.5 million in Measure K reductions, which includes deferment of the Pescadero Fire Station and a $5 million reduction of the Affordable Housing Fund.
Callagy has praised local departments for their response to the pandemic while continuing to deliver necessary services. As an example, the San Mateo County Medical Center converted its ambulance services to telehealth in just a few days while county parks and the district attorney and court system has shifted to virtual models to meet the needs of local residents."

Wolohan said in his statement that his background as a lifelong renter in Redwood City and his experience at the Riekes Center for Human Enhancement in multiple roles has brought the issues facing middle class and poor families into focus.
He pledges to prioritize education by increasing school funding, help support parks and local businesses and to invest in public transportation.
Rasmussen in his statement cites his work as a veteran Redwood City police officer and homeless outreach coordinator as experience needed in city government amid uncertain times.

Seven months into the Covid19 pandemic we know a lot more as to how the virus is transmitted and what we need to do to start to resume all services including government. The virus is in fact airborne and 85% of transmission comes through the air. The balance 15% is surface and droplet transmission. To prevent airborne transmission social distancing, mask wearing and proper and ongoing hygiene are the most effective measures. See the Swiss Cheese model of disease prevention in the photo.
Just last week San Mateo County moved into the Orange Tier of Covid19 monitoring allowing different types of businesses and groups to start reopening:
""Activities and businesses that have a lower risk of spreading COVID-19 are allowed to open sooner. Higher-risk activities or businesses aren't allowed until later tiers. An activity or business's tier depends on whether it can:
https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
In fact even as Governor Newsom'S Executive Order N-29-20 notes, the earlier online meeting guidelines only applied for as long as state or local officials imposed or recommended social distancing measure. (https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-cont...) Bottom line, it is now time for local and state government agencies to resume meeting in person in public. Government meetings can accommodate most of those directives such as mask wearing at all times, allowing physical distance between individuals and limiting the number of people per square foot.
Updating government facilities to allow for the proper ventilation of indoor spaces needs to be made a priority. As Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has explained ventilation is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of containing the virus :
""the government's guidelines to tackle the virus, encapsulated in the acronym AHA, which stands for distancing, hygiene and face coverings, will be extended to become AHACL. The ""C"" stands for the government's coronavirus warning app, and ""L"" for Lüften or airing a room.
'Regular impact ventilation in all private and public rooms can considerably reduce the danger of infection,' the government's recommendation explains.""
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/germans-embrace-fresh-air-to-ward-off-coronavirus
Government meeting rooms and council chambers may need to increase ventilation protocols to decrease airborne transmission but at least for closed system buildings with good heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems this should not be very complicated.
If need be the reopening process can be gradual as in:
1. Require only elected officials and government staff to meet in person in public chambers with cameras on.
2. As a second step allow 25% in person public participation occupancy through a reservation system.
3. Increase public in person participation as the situation allows.
Government officials claiming they cannot meet to do their jobs in person when they are able to go out and support protesters is hypocritical and needs to stop. The sooner the better. Then again maybe I wouldn't be pushing so hard for elected officials to return to in person meetings if they at least had the presence of mind to go on camera and be seen during meetings instead of hiding who knows where and not making the nominal effort of facing their constituents in the manner that has become prevalent in these pandemic times!"

But you can still cast or hand off your ballot in person this year — and you can do it early or on Election Day.
Dubbed ""vote centers"" rather than ""polling places,"" physical voting locations will also be a bit different than in years past.
The amount of in-person polling places in California will be limited compared to previous elections, in accordance with a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in August, but some vote centers already opened up as early as Oct. 24.
Centers are required to remain open Saturday through Monday Nov. 2 for at least eight hours each day and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Although every registered and active voter in California was already mailed a ballot in October, polling places will still be open for same day voter registration, for those who need assistance with language or disabilities — or for those who simply want to witness the historic election day unfold.
In Redwood City, five vote centers will will open on Saturday. There are also seven drop-off locations available throughout Redwood City.
The American Legion Post 105, the Assessor County Clerk Recorders Office, the Fair Oaks Branch Library, San Mateo County Law Library and the SMC Office of Eduction Room, will all be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday through Nov. 2 and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.

All of these changes to voting in California this year are to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Vote center volunteers and employees are required to space voting booths apart, sanitize surfaces and encourage those waiting in line to socially distance.
Voters are encouraged to arrive with a face covering, but those who show up without will be provided one.
Some of the first vote centers opened in California Oct. 21; in Los Angeles, hundreds lined up outside the Staples Center waiting to vote in person.

SAN MATEO COUNTY, CA — San Mateo County released its official, certified election results on Thursday for the Nov. 3 general election, which saw 85.9 percent voter turnout, the county's highest rate since 1968.
Voters cast 380,193 ballots for the Nov. 3 general election, out of 442,637 registered voters. In 2016, voter turnout was 81.6 percent, with323,303 votes cast out of 396,341 registered voters.
San Mateo County Chief Elections Officer Mark Church said the high voter turnout was expected this year.
""The Presidential Election cycle traditionally draws in more voters due to the high-profile nature of the contest, but even as compared to other Presidential elections this was a notable showing,"" Church wrote in an email to Bay City News.
In recent years, voter turnout for presidential elections hovered around 80 percent. This year, several factors such as California's Voter's Choice Act, Senate Bill (SB) 415 and the county's Voter Education Outreach Program contributed to the high turnout, according to Church.
The state's Voter's Choice Act expanded voting options, while SB415 moved governing board elections to even-numbered years.
As a result, Church said, ""This is the largest number of jurisdictions, candidates, offices and ballot styles ever to be placed on a Presidential ballot.""
Of the ballots cast, over 90 percent were cast by mail. Church said that the entire election process went very well and that approximately 90 percent of the 14,251 challenged ballots were cured.
Of the uncured ballots, over 300 could not be resolved due to issues like being postmarked after Election Day.
Church said the county overcame the challenge of the COVID-19pandemic while accommodating the high voter turnout.
""Even though we had over 33,000 visitors to our Vote Centers and over 1,300 employees and volunteers, I'm proud to say we had no COVID outbreaks at the polls or the elections office, due to the extensive precautions we implemented,"" Church said.
There were some close races at the city level, with less than 100votes separating some candidates.
In the Pacifica District 1 city council race, incumbent Sue Vaterlaus beat newcomer Mayra Espinosa by just 19 votes, earning 1,685 vote sover Espinosa's 1,666.
Just 33 votes separated two candidates in Millbrae's city council race. Newcomer Anders Fung barely edged out You You Xue for the third spot on the council, getting 4,746 votes compared to Xue's 4,713. Incumbents Gina Papan and Ann Schneider took the top two spots.
In East Palo Alto's city council, just 69 votes separated the two candidates vying for the third spot on the council. Newcomer Antonio Lopez won a spot on the council, with 2,998 votes compared to Webster Lincoln's2,929 votes. Incumbents Lisa Gauthier and Carlos Romero got the top two spots.
In the city of San Mateo, there were two opposing measures -Measures Y and R - addressing development and housing for the city's general plan. When the first unofficial results were reported early on Nov. 4, both measures fell below the majority needed for either to pass. In Thursday's final official results, Measure Y barely passed the simple majority threshold it needed, with 50.05 percent votes in favor, while Measure R had only 46.1percent votes in favor.
Voters in San Bruno, San Mateo, Half Moon Bay and Daly City supported their cities' various tax measures, but support for Measure V inEast Palo Alto lagged. With only 64.7 percent votes in favor, Measure V fell just short of the 2/3 majority it needed to pass. While revenue from the other tax measures were designated for general city funds, Measure V revenue was meant to support affordable housing.
In the presidential race, 77.9 percent of San Mateo County voters supported President-elect Joe Biden over President Donald Trump, who received20.2 percent of votes.
