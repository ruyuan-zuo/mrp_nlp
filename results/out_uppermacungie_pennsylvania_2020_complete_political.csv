Officials are expecting over 1.5 million visitors to the city.
""We are hosting the largest event in the city's history,"" said Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. ""Make no mistake, the City of Philadelphia will have the world's attention, and we are doing our part to be as prepared and coordinated as possible.""
Roads will be closed. Train schedules will be completely overhauled. The National Guard, Secret Service, Coast Guard, along with state, county, and local law enforcement will be on hand.
Meanwhile, the region is celebrating the arrival of the head of Vatican City in every conceivable way, from paraphernalia to fake Pope androids.
Here's everything you need to know to be prepared for the upcoming papal visit.
Papal Itinerary
The stop in Philadelphia is only a small part of his larger, inaugural trip to the United States. He will also be traveling to New York City and Washington D.C.
The Pope will arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Thursday, Sept. 24. That evening he will do a prayer (Vespers) at St. Patrick's Cathedral (open only to the Clergy of St. Patrick's Cathedral).
On Friday, Sept. 25, he will visit the United Nations and Address to the United Nations General Assembly. At 11:30 a.m., he will conduct a multi-religious service at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, World Trade Center (ticket lottery closed).
At 4 p.m. Friday, he will visit Our Lady Queen of Angels School, East Harlem (open only to a select group of students and administrators from four Catholic schools in New York, and a gym full of Catholic Charities representatives)
He will also do a procession through Central Park (ticket lottery here) before a 6 p.m. Mass at Madison Square Garden. Tickets for the mass are reportedly very limited and not sold to the public; contact your own diocesan chancery office for more information.
Pope Francis will arrive at Philadelphia International Airport at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, September 26.
His first event in Philadelphia will be a 10:30 a.m. mass at Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul, a historic church that has stood since 1864. It is the largest brownstone structure in Philadelphia. This mass is closed to the public.
Francis will then proceed to Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, where he will meet with bishops at the chapel there. This event is also closed to the public.
His first public event will follow at Independence National Historical Park in center city Philadelphia, where he will give a speech on religious freedom and immigration.
He will conclude Saturday with an appearance at the Festival of Families on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 7:30 p.m. There will be a variety of entertainment on hand, including musical and visual ""high level performers,"" according to the World Meeting of Families' official site.
On Saturday evening, Francis will return to Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary to sleep.
The next morning will be kicked off with another meeting with the bishops at the Seminary at 9:15 a.m.
At 11 a.m., as has been a trademark of his reign, Francis will visit prisoners at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in North Philadelphia. Prisoners there have already prepared a special chair for Francis as a gift.
At 4 p.m., the Pope will return to the Parkway to say the concluding mass for the 2015 World Meeting of Families.
He will then meet with organizers of the World Meeting briefly at 7 p.m., before boarding his return flight to Rome at 8 p.m.
Public Transportation
For the Papal mass on Friday, Sept. 25 at Madison Square Garden, NJ Transit plans to run extra trains to New York and add buses bound for the Port Authority Bus terminal, according to nj.com. No special ticketing is needed, and the state Department of Transportation will not close eastbound roads to New York for the papal visit there.
SEPTA has been completely overhauled in preparation for the Pope's arrival.
All passengers wishing to use Regional Rail to travel on the weekend of September 26-27 must purchase a special Papal pass. This pass is the only pass that will be accepted for travel over the weekend.
Passes cost $10 a day, and can be purchased at select SEPTA stations around the region. For a list of locations where passes can be picked up, please see the SEPTA website.
SEPTA's regional rail will only depart from certain stations at certain times. Unless otherwise indicated, all other stations are closed. Here is a list of all stations operating departing trains, with the arrival station in parenthesis.
To alleviate congestion, two travel time slots will depart for center city in the morning. Trains will begin leaving between 5:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., and then again from 8:30 a.m. until noon. Cornwell Heights will only depart from 5:30 until 8:30, while Croydon will only leave from 8:30 a.m. until noon. Return service will be between 5:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.
There will be no service from center city to outlying stations during the morning travel period, and no service to center city from outlying stations in the evening travel period.
Buses and trolleys are also operating on modified schedules, in addition to the Norristown High Speed Line. See the full schedule on the SEPTA site.
During the weekend of Sept. 26 and 27, NJ Transit regular tickets will not be accepted and the agency will not be operating regular weekend service on either the Atlantic City Rail Line or the River Line. Special tickets went on sale beginning Saturday, Aug. 15 for people planning to ride the Atlantic City Rail Line and River Line as the routes will only operate on a limited schedule on both days.
Customers need to purchase their NJ Transit tickets in advance of this weekend. No one will be allowed to ride without a special event ticket and no tickets will be sold on Saturday, Sept. 26 or Sunday, Sept. 27. No other fares, including monthly passes, Family SuperSaver or cash, will be accepted on the Atlantic City Rail Line or River Line.
PATCO, which crosses from New Jersey into Philadelphia over the Ben Franklin Bridge, will also be operating a modified schedule.
Only special passes will be accepted to ride PATCO on September 26 and 27. One day passes are $5 and two day passes are $10. They can be purchased here.
PATCO will operate from four of its New Jersey stations:
And all service will run to only one Philadelphia station, at 9th/10th and Locust.
Road Closures
The most significant road closure during the Papal visit is the Ben Franklin Bridge. In addition, the following highways will be closed. These roads will close at 10 p.m. Friday and open at 12:00 a.m. Monday.
Within the city itself, a ""traffic box"" surrounding center city and parts of University City has been established.
Cars will be able to travel inside the green lines below, but they will not be allowed to exit.

Meanwhile, significant traffic is expected on other major roads throughout the region that will remain open.
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is working with officials to ensure that construction will not slow traffic in sensitive areas over the weekend.
Road closures and the huge influx of visitors will create severe traffic in the suburbs. Route 422 is one major road likely to be affected.
All residents and visitors are advised to avoid traveling by private vehicle, especially toward the city, whenever possible on September 26 and 27.
Security
Montgomery County announced on August 23 that 600 National Guard troops had been requested for the weekend of September 26 and 27.
The personnel, requested from the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, will help with traffic control, crowd control, and infrastructure security.
""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Montgomery County and its residents to experience something as important and inspirational as a Papal visit,"" Josh Shapiro, chair of the Montgomery County Commissioners, said in a press release. ""The eyes of the world will be on our region, and I am confident that the long term benefits of Pope Francis' visit will far outweigh the temporary inconveniences we might face. Our entire Public Safety Department and all of their local and regional partners have worked hard to help ensure inconveniences are minimized and safety is maximized.""
In addition, the county has asked for helicopters, boats, refueling trucks, and other personnel to assist the Joint Rapid Response Teams and other supporting teams working to keep both motorists and those on boats safe.
The county's Bomb Squad has also been training in anticipation of the weekend, and the Secret Service is organizing security in the city.
In New Jersey, the Camden County Prosecutor's Office is taking the lead as ""incident command,"" according to nj.com, but the Secret Service has been tasked with protecting the Pope, with help from the FBI and New Jersey State Police. Partnerships have also extended to Burlington, Gloucester and Salem counties in planning for emergency situations that could occur.
Businesses
The City of Philadelphia has launched a hotline to help area businesses prepare for the big weekend in September.
The Philadelphia Department of Commerce has launched a hotline that will be available Monday-Friday from 9 a.m. to p.m. The hotline is available via phone at 215-683-2100 and email at business@phila.gov.
Other questions can be answered at the city's information center for the Pope's visit, here.
A Pope has not visited Philadelphia since Pope John Paul II came here in 1979.
He spent time at Logan Circle, the Convention Center, and the Civic Center, saying mass and speaking to the crowd. He also visited a shrine in Doylestown.
Like Francis, John Paul visited the historic Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul and said mass there. Over a million people were present.
Francis' visit in 2015 is of huge cultural and historical significance, and the Philadelphia region is sparing no effort in an opulent display of pageantry.
Bobbleheads and Other Paraphernalia
The World Meeting of Families, the event prompting the Pope's Keystone State visit, has launched a retail website.

In addition to the ever-popular bobblehead ($25), the website is offering an array of papal products, including plush dolls, t-shirts, posters and more.
For those who want to feel the Pope's presence even before the September event, there is a 69"" life-sized Pope Francis statue for sale ($160). Don't have the interior space for that? A 10"" tabletop Pope Francis is available for $20.
There are also rosary beads, gifts, coffee mugs and tote bags. Click here to view the site.
Beers
Two special beers have brewed in honor of the Pope's arrival to Philadelphia.
Philadelphia Brewing Co. has produced a new beer, appropriately titled ""Holy Wooder,"" in conjunction with the papal visit. The beer is a draft-only Belgian style Tripel, which, naturally, was developed in conjunction with the South Philly bar known as The Pub on Passyunk East (POPE.)
The Philadelphia Brewing Co. offering, in its logo, describes itself as ""The Official Beer of the Pope,"" although it's unclear whether or not that designation has the backing of the Vatican.
Holy Wooder is not to be confused with YOPO- You Only Pope Once- a brew developed by the Cape May Brewing Company.
Cape May Brewing Company's #YOPO will be available by mid-September, just in time for Pope Francis' arrival.
The company described the beer as a ""Papal themed small batch Pale Ale,"" that includes an ""unholy amount of hops.""
""You only Pope once: that's the motto, people, #YOPO,"" the brewery wrote on their Facebook page.
When ready, the beer will be available in select locations in southern New Jersey and the Philadelphia area.
Sales representatives with the brewery note that the beer will pair well with a cut of Argentinean beef, Francis' home nation, the Chicago Sun Times reports.
PopeBot
Wandering across the ragged globe, relying upon the kindness of strangers, innocent metallic eyes looking out upon the vagaries of a cold world, Hitch Bot infamously met its bloody end in the city of brotherly love.
Weeks later, a region that had reminded itself of its dark underbelly - from booing Santa Claus and pelting a left fielder with batteries, to ""destroying"" a kindly robot - solemnly prepared for a visit from one of the world's most distinguished emissaries of morality and Christianity.
Yet in the molten ashes of Hitchbot, in the anxious hours leading up to arrival of the leader of the Vatican, a different kind of entity was borne upon southeastern Pennsylvania.
His name is Pope Bot.
You can also call him the ""Papal Robot Hitchhiker,"" as his creators at WMMR do:
""Hello, I'm Pope Bot. Inspired by my friend, #HitchBot, who sadly met his demise in Philadelphia, I am taking a journey around the Delaware Valley. The goal of my adventure is to prove to the Vatican that this area is a safe environment for the leader of the church. Plus, there is a prize each week for one person who gives me a lift!
Check the hashtag #PopeBotPhilly and all my social media accounts to see where I am and where I have been.""
The Papal Robot Hitchhiker was being carted through several Montgomery and Chester County locations late on recent afternoon, and was spotted at the Plymouth Meeting Mall at around 4:30 p.m.
He also paid his respects to Valley Forge in the afternoon, and posed for photos at the Exton Square Mall and at the Wegmans market locations in Malvern and Bryn Mawr earlier in the day.
The Papal Robot Hitchhiker is social media savvy, and has created accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Observers have said that Pope Bot represents a unique second opportunity for the people of Pennsylvania.
""Dear Phila: Please, please be kind to @PopeBotPhilly! This is our chance for a major do-over!"" Donna Crilley Farrell commented on Twitter.
Pope Bot later worked his way toward Center City Philadelphia to 4th and Market Street, where he appeared on air with Mike and Alex on Fox 29 at 7 a.m. the next morning, according to his Facebook page.
The Papal Robot is undoubtedly on a mission.
""Let's show the rest of the country,"" he wrote decisively on Twitter, ""How kind (gentle & responsible) we can be."""

A new bill in Harrisburg would wield fines of up to $300 toward pet owners who leave their dogs and cats in hot cars, according to ABC27 News.
Specifically, the bill would outlaw the confinement of a dog or car in an unattended vehicle under conditions that jeopardize the pet's health, the report said.
The bill (Senate Bill 977) is being introduced in the state Legislature by Sen. Rob Teplitz (D-Dauphin/Perry). The House version (Bill 1516) will be submitted by Rep. Frank Farry (R-Bucks) and Rep. Kevin Schreiber (D-York).
According to the ASPCA, thousands of pets die each year due to heatstroke and suffocation when left in hot parked cars.
""On a 78-degree day, the temperature inside a parked car can reach 160 degrees, even with the windows cracked,"" read a previous statement from the group's national website, adding that it only takes a few minutes for pets to ""face death"" in such conditions.
According to ABC27, the bill would allow police and human officers, following a ""reasonable"" search for the owner, to physically remove the dog or cat from the vehicle if they believe the animal's health is in danger. The officer would them to a veterinary hospital or animal clinic for care, leaving a note on the vehicle regarding where they can be picked up by the owner.
In addition, the officer would not be held liable for damages to the vehicle.
Currently, there are 17 states with laws protecting pets in parked cars."

Kane will make a statement and answer questions at a press conference, according to ABC news.
Her spokesman Chuck Ardo maintained that she will not resign, according to the Associated Press.
Kane was arraigned on Saturday.
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Aug. 24.
Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman alleged that Kane leaked grand jury documents to the press and then lied about it.
Kane is being charged with obstruction of the administration of law, official oppression, conspiracy, false swearing, and perjury, among other charges.

How dependent is Pennsylvania on the federal government compared to other states?
It's somewhere in the middle, according to a new study.
WalletHub conducted a study to answer that question across the county. It used four factors to come up with a ranking of all 50 states:
Pennsylvania came in at No. 22, with No. 1 being the least dependent and No. 50 being the most, tied with Alaska and just ahead of Texas.
The Keystone State's neighbors, New Jersey and Delaware, were the first and second least dependent states in the entire nation.
You can see the full results in the map below:

WalletHub
The next least dependent states were Illinois, Minnesota and Kansas. The most dependent were Montana, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and New Mexico.
Pennsylvania ranked as the 13th state overall for return on taxpayer investment, getting $1.41 back per taxpayer on the federal income tax contributions.
One irony pointed out by WalletHub was the discrepancy in how states voted vs. how reliant they were on the federal government.
States that voted Republican in the 2012 election, whose party preaches less dependance on the government, had an average rank of 33.2. States that tend to vote Democrat had an average rank of 18.3.

Tom Wolf has a plan for reducing crime and spending taxpayer money on something more productive than prison.
Education.
That was his message on Wednesday at a speech outside the state prison in Harrisburg, and it was the essence of an announcement Thursday which outlined a $400 million basic education funding increase in his 2015-2016 budget.
Nodding to the prison, Wolf said that improving the education of young children was needed ""If we want people in Pennsylvania to have fulfilled lives and not end up in places like this.""
The specifics of the plan come from educational professionals around the state, Wolf said.
""I have traveled across Pennsylvania and listened to educators and administrators detail their plans to ensure additional education funding is invested in the classroom to benefit our children,"" Wolf said in a press release Thursday.
On his website, Wolf outlines the details of his proposal and how many districts would be impacted by certain measures:
Critics of the measure say that it will be hard to come up with the funds to achieve what Wolf wants to achieve. Wolf said that he plans to pay for the budget with a severance tax on natural gas.
Other local and national lawmakers applauded the speech and Wolf's points.
""Exactly right: let's invest in early childhood education,"" U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), a prison reform advocate, wrote on his Facebook page, posting a link to the speech.
The Department of Education is currently in the process of reviewing Wolf's plan for each individual school district. Feedback on the plan is due June 15.

Matt Baker (R-Tioga/Bradford/Potter) to resign from office for not allowing a medical marijuana bill to come to a vote in the Pennsylvania House of representatives.
Rep. Matt Baker heads the health committee in the House and has the power to prevent the House from voting on the measure.
Senate Bill 3 passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the Senate earlier this month. It was cosponsored by State Sen. Daylin Leach (D-Montgomery/Delaware), who was one of 19 Democrats and 21 Republicans who supported the measure in the Senate. It passed by a 40-7 margin.
The online petition has 1,360 signatures as of Sunday. Over 600 people have commented on the page. The petition expresses distrust in Baker's judgement:
Rep. Matt Baker has clearly shown he is not capable of representing the state of Pennsylvania. Mr. Baker has shown that he will vote for his own interest which goes against the very title he has been trusted with. This petition is asking for Mr. Baker to step down as he has violated the trust between him and the people of the state of Pennsylvania.
Some expressed frustration that a single person had the power to prevent a vote on a bill that gained broad bipartisan support in the Senate and presumably would enjoy similar support in the House.
""How can one man have so much impact...something doesn't seem right about that,"" commented Reddit user keystroker007.
Others questioned Baker's motivations in preventing the House from considering the bill.
""It's absolutely ludicrous to think that medical cannabis is not beneficial for human health issues,"" writes Randolph Yale, on the petition. ""This guy is not for the people, he is for himself and his pockets. He needs to go!""
Biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is Baker's top campaign financier, providing over $5,000, according to VoteSmart.org.
""Pharmaceuticals and health"" donated more to Baker than any other identified industry, the analysis shows, providing Baker with a total of $12,000.
According to Baker, medical marijuana's benefits have not been conclusively proven. He cited a letter from the Pennsylvania Medical Society that cites contradictory research, including evidence that seizures in epileptic children worsened after using medical marijuana.
Leach calls passing medical marijuana ""a moral issue, not a partisan issue.""
""Every day that passes without medical cannabis in Pennsylvania is another day of needless suffering,"" Leach said.

Daylin Leach (D-Montgomery/Delaware), is facing a roadblock in the state House of Representatives.
Rep. Matt Baker (R-Bradford/Potter/Tioga) says that he won't allow the bill, which passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the Senate, to even come up for a vote in the House.
Baker heads the health committee in the House and could potentially prevent the House from deliberating on the measure.
Leach, who cosponsored Senate Bill 3 with Senator Mike Fulmer (R-Dauphin/Lebanon/York), was one of 19 Democrats and 21 Republicans who supported the measure in the Senate, passing it by a 40-7 margin.
Leach calls passing medical marijuana ""a moral issue, not a partisan issue.""
""Every day that passes without medical cannabis in Pennsylvania is another day of needless suffering,"" Leach said.
Baker says that medical marijuana's benefits have not been conclusively proven, and turns to a letter from the Pennsylvania Medical Society that cites contradictory research, including evidence that seizures in epileptic children worsened after using medical marijuana.
Baker is also working on legislation to address drug overdoses in Pennsylvania, and in statements about his work he suggests that other drugs can provide a gateway to deadly drugs like heroin.
""What is still surprising for many people to learn is that these drug overdoses are not always the result of illegal drugs or, at least, the addictions didn't start out with illegal drugs,"" Baker writes.
Baker's critics, in turn, point to his campaign finance contributions, which include donations from pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Merck, and Rite Aid PAC, whom they say would not benefit from the legalization of a competing form of medicine.
Biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is Baker's top campaign financier, providing over $5,000, according to VoteSmart.org.
""Pharmaceuticals and health"" donated more to Baker than any other identified industry, the analysis shows, providing Baker with a total of $12,000.
Some have called for Baker to be removed from office, starting an online petition that had garnered 1,162 signatures as of Friday morning.
Gov. Tom Wolf, a supporter of the measure to legalize medical marijuana, is optimistic that the bill can be passed.
""It was passed overwhelmingly in the Senate, I think it would pass overwhelmingly in the House. I hope we can convince the right people to do the right thing,"" he told WPMT.

Under current state law, bookmaking and pool selling is illegal. This crime is a first degree misdemeanor under Title 18 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. While pools in offices are illegal, pools in social clubs, volunteer organizations and other non-profits were legalized by legislation passed last year, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.
State Senator Lisa Boscola, however, aims to make all such pools legal in Pennsylvania.
Boscola is co-sponsoring a bill that would amend Title 18 and allow for small office gaming pools. According to Boscola's website, under her pending legislation, small office gaming pools would be legal provided there are no more than 100 participants, the wagering amount is no more than $20 per participant, and all wagers collected are paid as prizes to one or more participants or a non-profit. The pool operator is not allowed to retain any of the wagers paid by participants.
Boscola's legislation would extend the decriminalization to ""friends, loved ones, office colleagues and others who offer these small betting pools,"" the Tribune-Review reported.
Despite pools for the Super Bowl or March Madness being almost as popular as the sporting events themselves and having been made legal for non-profits in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania State Police has taken the position that these types of pools are illegal under federal law, TribLive.com reported.
Last weekend, state liquor enforcement officers raided three Northampton County fire departments that were offering Super Bowl pools, motivating Boscola to speak out, the Tribune-Review said.
""The department is doing more than just thumbing their nose at us and the governor,"" Boscola said according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. ""The department's draconian stance on this issue is a senseless attack on volunteer organizations such as volunteer fire departments, veterans' clubs and religious civic groups,"" she said according to the Tribune-Review.

Under the proposed legislation, truck drivers would be required to ""make all reasonable efforts"" to remove snow and ice from their vehicles and tractor-trailers before driving, according to a news release from Senator Boscola. If the built-up ice or snow on the roof of the truck is determined to potentially ""pose a threat to persons or property,"" the driver of the vehicle could face a fine between $25 and $75, the news release said.
""Ice dislodged from rapidly moving trucks is very dangerous – and sometimes deadly,"" Boscola said in Senate floor remarks on Thursday. ""While public awareness outreach is the key to this process, we must underscore the seriousness of this issue with the force of law.""
Current Pennsylvania law only penalizes drivers if ice debris causes serious injury or death, with fines ranging between $200 and $1,000 for each offense. Boscola said her proposed bill would reinforce the current law and deter drivers from leaving snow and ice on their trucks.
The state senator applauded some businesses for constructing snow and ice scraping devices for their trucks and hopes others will follow suit, according to the news release. Her proposed snow and ice removal legislation was prompted by the Christmas Day death of Christine Lambert in 2005, who was hit by an 8-inch piece of ice as she drove to visit her family.
Boscola has reintroduced the proposal each ensuing legislative session.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane has reportedly declined to defend the state's controversial gun law.
Act 192, signed into law by Gov. Tom Corbett in October, allows gun-rights groups to sue Pennsylvania municipalities that enact their own gun-control laws. The law is scheduled to take effect this month, but the cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Lancaster have sued to stop that from happening, CBS said.
State Sen. Daylin Leach (D-Mongtomery and Delaware), who is among the lawmakers suing to stop the implementation of Act 192, said it ""can only be described as a gift to the NRA.""
A Kane spokeswoman told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the Attorney General will not be representing the commonwealth against those challenges.
""The attorney general determined it would be more efficient and in the best interest of the commonwealth for the Office of General Counsel to handle this matter,"" Kane's spokeswoman, Renee Martin, told The Philadelphia Inquirer.
This is the second time that Kane has declined to represent the commonwealth in a legal challenge, the Inquirer said; 18 months ago, she declined to defend Pennsylvania against a challenge to its same-sex marriage ban.

The petition was issued in response to the sentencing of Pennsylvania nursing home aide, Jennifer Whalen, to 18 months in jail for ordering abortifacient pills online for her pregnant teenage daughter. Her daughter was later admitted to the hospital with severe abdominal pain, and Whalen admitted to giving her the abortifacient pills.
NARAL claims Whalen would not have had to take such extreme measures if Pennsylvania laws were not so strict.
""Instead of working to expand access to this constitutional right, the Commonwealth has decided to punish women facing desperate situations,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.
Whalen and her daughter would have had to travel is 150 miles and go through a mandatory waiting period, requiring them to either make the trip twice or pay for overnight accommodations, according to Karen Ritter, Vice-Chair of NARAL Pro-Choice America's national board.
However pro-life supporters at the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation say that the Whalen case could be alleviated not by fewer restrictions on abortion, but by education and support for pregnant women. Micaiah Bilger is a spokeswoman for the Federation.
""When families like the Whalens are struggling financially and facing an unplanned pregnancy, they should not have to feel that abortion is their only option,"" Bilger said.
""Women deserve easy access to pregnancy and parenting support for themselves and their families."""

Legislation was passed Wednesday by the Pennsylvania State Senate that would allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes. Senate Bill 1182 passed by a vote of 43 to 7.
The bill now heads to the state House of Representatives, but Republican House leaders have made it clear that they think decisions about medical marijuana should be left up to the federal Food and Drug Administration.
Gov. Tom Corbett has said that he is opposed to legalizing any form of marijuana, The Philadelphia Inquirer said.

The main drag on Pennsylvanian roads are deficient bridges and ""narrow rural arterial lanes"", which are high-capacity roads that deliver traffic from collector roads to freeways or expressways.
""Many of the easiest repairs and fixes to state highway and bridge systems have already been made and the rate of progress is slowing down,"" said David T. Hartgen, lead author of the Annual Highway Report since 1984. Pennsylvania ranks 34th in fatality rate.

Democratic challenger Tom Wolf holds a commanding lead over Gov. Tom Corbett, a new poll finds.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday, Sept. 11, finds that Wolf is leading Corbett 59 to 35 percent with eight weeks before Election Day.
Wolf, the former secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, leads 91 to 7 percent among Democrats and 53 to 39 percent among independent voters, the poll found. Corbett's lead among Republicans, 66 to 28 percent, was described by Quinnipiac as ""lackluster.""
""A stunningly bad showing for Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, who is clobbered across the board on issues, leadership and other character traits by a candidate who was unknown to most voters earlier this year,"" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.
Live interviewers surveyed 1,161 likely voters from Sept. 3 to 8, Quinnipiac University said. Both land lines and cell phones were called; the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points."

She hopes that these paintings will slow the plans to build homes on the area.
The Audubon Society of the Lehigh Valley have declared the property an important birding area, but hosing developer Traditions of America has submitted plans to build 265 new homes on the land.
The plan has caused conflict in the township commission. Several residents seek to keep Green Pond undeveloped and protect the birds that live there, while Traditions of America insist that they have taken the habitat into due consideration.
""They're in our neighborhood and they're extraordinary,"" Evans told the Express-Times. ""We should be thrilled we have the (bird habitat). We should be finding township money to maintain it.""
The paintings will be given to the township commissioners. Evans has already given several of these paintings to the commissioners, once at a public meeting.
Commissioner Thomas Nolan said that while the Township appreciates the gesture, ""It's too soon to tell"" what will happen with the development plans."

Justin Simmons (R-Lehigh/Northampton):
State Rep. Justin Simmons (R-Lehigh/Northampton) has announced that Lehigh, Montgomery and Northampton counties will receive more than $1.4 million in Marcellus Shale impact fees collected during calendar year 2013. Checks will be distributed by July 1.
Under Act 13, impact fees are imposed on drilling companies that are extracting natural gas in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale regions. The fees fluctuate depending on the price of natural gas and the rate of inflation. The revenue is collected by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), which released the state, county and municipal totals this week. 
""Even though Lehigh, Montgomery and Northampton counties are not part of the Marcellus Shale formation, residents are still receiving a financial benefit as promised under Act 13,"" said Simmons. ""The funding can be used in a variety of ways that improve our quality of life, including water system upgrades and road repairs."" 
The PUC announced that Lehigh County will receive $340,418.70 from the Marcellus Legacy Fund, while Montgomery and Northampton counties will receive $774,718.60 and $286,776.97, respectively. The fund derives its revenue from the 40 percent portion of collected impact fees that goes back to the state. The money distributed by the fund can be used by counties for emergency response planning, training and other activities; water, storm water, and sewer system construction and repair; infrastructure maintenance and repair; as well as statewide environmental initiatives.  
The PUC collected impact fees totaling more than $225 million in 2013, bringing the three-year total since Act 13's passage to nearly $630 million.
