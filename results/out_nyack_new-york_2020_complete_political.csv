Why are you seeking elective office?
I'm running for Congress because, for me, policy is personal. I know what it is for a working family to struggle and rely on government assistance to survive, and I am going to bring those lived experiences with me to Congress.
I grew up in the working-class village of Spring Valley, where I was raised by a young, single mom who, like so many women throughout my district, and all throughout this country, worked multiple jobs just to provide for our family—even as we relied on Section 8 housing and food stamps. When we talk about the fight for a $15 minimum wage at the federal level, that fight is personal for me.
My mom got help from my grandparents. My grandfather was a janitor at our local middle school, and later, he was a small business owner. My grandmother cleaned homes, and when day care was too expensive, she took me to work with her. Now, I'm running to represent the same people whose homes I watched my grandmother clean growing up. When we talk about the fight for universal child care, that's a fight I'm invested in based on my own experience.
After my grandfather died of cancer, I watched helplessly as my grandmother worked well past the age of retirement just to pay for the high cost of prescription drugs and medical procedures not fully covered by Medicare as we know it. When I quit my job to try to better my community by running for Congress, I lost my health insurance. I believe health care should be a human right in the richest nation on Earth, not tied to employment status or economic means.
I'm 32 years old. I remember what it's like to be a broke college student, because for me, that wasn't so long ago. And the fact is, this country has failed its young people. Thousands of people in my district, my age and younger, despite having college degrees, are still living at home with their parents because they can't afford to pay rent or own a home. We were told that if we just went to college and graduated like our parents may have, things would work out. But we know that that's not true. Part of that is due to low wages in this broken economy -- wages that have been stagnant for decades as the cost of living has soared -- but it's also due to a student debt crisis to the tune of $1.7 trillion. I propose tuition-free public colleges and universities and forgiving college debt to liberate an entire generation of people to meaningfully participate in our economy.
The Green New Deal is personal for me, and in fact the environment is my number one priority. Our generation is inheriting a planet that stands to be devastated by climate catastrophe because people who have been in office for a really long time have failed to act with the kind of urgency the issue requires.
And when Democrats huddle together to talk about how to respond to this President's embrace of white supremacy, and his assault daily on members of the LGBTQ+ community, of which I am a part, I think that more people like me need to be at the table participating in that discussion and indeed driving the conversation. In fact, there has never been an openly gay, black member of Congress in the 244-year history of the United States.
We have never been at a moment in American history when we have more urgently needed people in office for whom policy is personal. I think we get better policy outcomes when we have more people in Congress for whom policy is personal. Representatives like me can be trusted to always fight for the best interests of their constituents, even when the doors are closed in the halls of Congress and our constituents can't see what we are doing.
The fact is, I've been fighting my whole life. First, it was against the odds of my upbringing, to the point where I was able to make it to Stanford University, work in the Obama Administration at the Department of Justice (vetting candidates for federal judgeships and working on criminal justice reform), and then attend Harvard Law School. More recently, as a lawyer in government, I've been fighting in the courtrooms of Westchester County on behalf of my future constituents. Now, I'm running to fight for all of the people in my district and across the country.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation/state/community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation and our world is climate change, and I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that we have a planet to live on.
Our planet is in peril. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we only have 10 years left in which we can act to prevent irreversible damage to Earth due to global warming.
We need bold solutions to meet this unprecedented challenge. The Green New Deal, outlined in H.R. 109, proposes federal mandates to decarbonize our economy instead of unproven market-based ideas. It would transition America to 100% renewable energy by 2030 and avert climate catastrophe, creating 20 million good-paying jobs in the process. It would also ensure that there is a just transition to green jobs for fossil fuel workers who are displaced, hold fossil fuel companies accountable, provide dedicated support to the communities most at risk, and invest in new, sustainable infrastructure across the country.
I will also co-sponsor the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, which would invest up to $180 billion over 10 years in sustainable retrofits that include all needed repairs; vastly improved health, safety, and comfort; and the elimination of carbon emissions in our federal public housing stock by transitioning them to solar energy.
The transportation sector is the single biggest contributor to carbon emissions globally. We need to wean ourselves off of relying on automobiles and transition to high-speed and light rail powered by clean, renewable energy sources. This would be especially useful in Rockland, where rail service is lacking.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Health care is a human right. But I am the only candidate in my race who supports Medicare for All, which is the only proposal that would ensure every single American has health care.
I am the only candidate in my race who supports an unadulterated Green New Deal, which would stop climate change while creating millions of good-paying jobs. I am the only candidate supporting universal child care, an issue that is deeply personal for me and which would help so many families throughout our country and district. And I am the only candidate who supports full college debt forgiveness, which would liberate an entire generation of young people to meaningfully participate in this economy.
Unlike many of my opponents in this race, I do not come from money or from a political family. I am not accepting any money from corporate PACs. I am not able to self-fund with millions of dollars of my own money, nor would I if I could because it would be a distortion of our democratic process.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
Some of my other priorities, which are outlined in further detail on my website, include:
Reducing the role of money in our elections, including by passing a system of public financing of our campaigns (as outlined in H.R. 1) and enacting a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.
Universal child care, including co-sponsoring the Universal Child Care and Early Learning Act (H.R. 3315), and supporting paid parental leave.
A massive investment in affordable housing, including co-sponsoring the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act (H.R. 1737) and repealing the Faircloth Amendment.
A $15 minimum wage, and raising the federal poverty line, as I recently wrote about in Crooked Media.
Fully funding our public schools, including increasing Title I funding for our most impoverished schools, as well as increasing funding under Titles II and IV and fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act.
LGBTQ+ rights and equity, including co-sponsoring the Equality Act (H.R. 5).
College debt relief and tuition-free public college, which will benefit students of color who are disproportionately burdened by debt.
A suite of criminal justice reforms to redress racial inequalities and harms in our justice system, including repealing the 1994 crime bill that fueled mass incarceration, defunding police and reinvesting this money in health, education, and alternatives to incarceration, eliminating mandatory minimums in sentencing, legalizing cannabis, and banning the box in employment applications.
Reproductive justice, including a constitutional amendment and federal statute to codify Roe v. Wade, repealing the Hyde Amendment, ensuring comprehensive sex education, and ensuring abortion and contraceptive coverage in any Medicare for All legislation that is enacted.
Comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for our undocumented community, as well as co-sponsoring the DREAM Act (H.R. 6) and ending family separation.
Disability rights, including expanding Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income to end the backlog of 800,000 cases, and ending the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My time in the Obama Administration, where I worked in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice on criminal justice reform and judicial nominations (including now-Supreme Court Justice Kagan), helped me engage with and learn the inner-workings of our federal government and gives me a keen understanding of how to make policy at the federal level. As a lawyer in the Westchester County Law Department, I worked on and won some of the County's biggest cases, and am also proud of drafting legislation and helping the County's Human Rights Commission respond to the uptick in acts of hate in Westchester. My work co-founding a national nonprofit called Rising Leaders, which teaches professional skills to underserved middle-school students and has gotten two grants from the Gates Foundation, has given me hands-on experience in improving the lives of our most vulnerable young people, and insight into what interventions will work best. My activism with the Spring Valley NAACP, and as a former member of the NAACP's National Board of Directors, has given me invaluable experience organizing residents at the local level for important causes, in addition to substantive policy experience nationally.
And I have already demonstrated an ability to organize my community to stand up to systemic racism: as a senior in college, after the Palo Alto Police Chief made comments embracing racial profiling, I successfully organized my fellow students and Palo Alto residents to pressure the department until she resigned and we obtained policing reforms.
I also believe that governing is a moral endeavor as much as it is a technical one, and that your personal experiences inform how hard you fight, and what you fight for. We need more elected officials for whom policy is personal - people who share the lived experiences of so many regular Americans who have to struggle to make ends meet, who have crippling student debt, who have experienced daily the realities of structural racism and inequality. As an attorney, I understand the laws that govern our society - and as a black, gay man and young person, I understand on a personal level how unjust laws affect people's lives. I am running for Congress to fight for a better world for everyone.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Growing up in the Village of Spring Valley, my mother told me that I could be anything I wanted. It was a radical idea. My mom, who struggled with mental illness, had dropped out of college and was working multiple jobs just to make ends meet — even as we relied on Section 8 housing and food stamps. But I took her advice, and I dreamed big. She opened my world to a universe of possibilities that would have been unthinkable for most people born into my circumstances. That's why I am drawn to public service: because every kid in this district should be able to dream big. My story should not be the exception.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been a brutal reminder that who we elect to office matters, and can mean the difference between life and death. Whether it's Andrew Cuomo, Donald Trump, or your local mayor, we can see the need for experienced, competent public servants to be in charge. In normal times, our state government is also responsible for our schools, roads, police, libraries, and environment, meaning the stakes couldn't get higher.
I've lived in Nyack almost my entire life, and I can't imagine any home besides Rockland County. After college, I intend on returning home. Yet I can't count how many young people I know who aren't sure if they want to return to Rockland. Property taxes are eye-watering, housing is unaffordable, our schools aren't funded properly, and irresponsible development threatens our quality of life. Decisions made by our officials, especially our State Senator, are critical to addressing this. That's why I'm supporting Elijah Reichlin-Melnick for State Senate.
I've had the chance to see Elijah in action in Nyack, where he is a Village Trustee. He's been a fierce advocate for the community, with no problem too small or large for him to tackle. He has principles and conviction, and he approaches every issue methodically. At Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, he's done in-depth research into how to make sure the government works for everyone. He has experience at every level of government, and currently serves as a top aide to State Sen. James Skoufis, who has been at the forefront of efforts for government transparency. Elijah's experience in the state legislature means that he won't have a learning curve, and can get right to work advancing our priorities right on day one. As a former elementary school teacher and a fellow Nyack High School graduate, Elijah understands the importance of a public school education in shaping lives and providing opportunity.
Elijah will represent the pragmatic progressive leadership we desperately need. He'll pass stricter gun laws and tax the ultra-wealthy and not the middle class. He'll bring funding home to Rockland and be a doer, not a talker. He knows every issue, inside and out, but is always ready to listen to opinions from others. Elijah's singular priority is making New York State a better place to live for everyone in our vibrant and diverse community.
I hope you'll join me in supporting him with your vote.

Among the local races, some residents of the Hudson Valley will be able to elect who will run for State Senate in District 38. The seat is being vacated by David Carlucci, who is running to replace Rep. Nita Lowey in Congress.
The oddly-drawn district covers Rockland County and, across the Hudson River, Ossining in Westchester County.
In anticipation of the election, Patch asked candidates in the contested races to answer questions about their campaigns and will be publishing candidate profiles as election day draws near.
Elijah Reichlin-Melnick is seeking the Democratic line on the ballot in November. His opponents in the June 23 primary are Justin L. Sweet and Eudson T. Francois. The winner will face either William J. Weber, Jr. or Matthew R. Weinberg, who are facing off in the Republican primary.
After graduating from Nyack High School, he earned a BA in History & Government from Cornell University, and a Master's in City & Regional Planning from Rutgers University.
He currently serves as the Legislative Director for State Senator James Skoufis, who represents parts of Rockland, Orange, and Ulster counties. He has held this position since January 2019. Over the past decade, he has steadily built his legislative experience by working at all levels of government. After working in Virginia in 2008 to help elect Barack Obama, he returned to Rockland and spent nearly five years as a constituent service specialist and district representative for Congressman Eliot Engel and Congresswoman Nita Lowey.
While completing his Master's degree, Reichlin-Melnick worked as the Executive Assistant for Orangetown Town Supervisor Andy Stewart, and managed Stewart's successful re-election campaigns in 2013 and 2015.
After earning his Bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 2006, he spent two years as an elementary school teacher at an inner city school in New Haven. From 2016-18, he was a Senior Research Planner at Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, a Newburgh-based non-profit focused on regional planning and local government issues throughout the Hudson Valley.
He has served as a Nyack Village Trustee since being appointed to the board in April 2017. He was elected to the position in November 2017 and re-elected in November 2019.
Check out Patch's full Q&A with Reichlin-Melnick:
Why are you seeking elective office?
In 2018 voters elected a progressive majority in the State Senate for the first time in decades, and in 2019 we saw the results: landmark action on climate change and reproductive health, making the property tax cap permanent, passage of the Child Victims Act, important gun safety reforms, decriminalization of marijuana, major election reforms, and more protections for LGBTQ New Yorkers. Now it's time to continue on the path of bold change while making sure that New York works for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected.
I am a proud progressive. I believe government has a vital role to play in protecting our quality of life by ensuring safe neighborhoods, clean water, good roads and mass transit, and well-funded education for our kids. Government exists to serve the people, and improve all our lives.
I love the Hudson Valley. It's why I've chosen to make my home in Nyack, the village where I was born and raised. But while Rockland and Westchester remain wonderful places to live, our region faces many challenges. Property taxes are some of the highest in the nation. Rents are rising rapidly, and healthcare costs are an enormous burden on many families. We're struggling to retain businesses. School districts like East Ramapo and Ossining aren't getting the education funding they deserve. Commuters in Rockland lack access to convenient mass transit.
State government can—and must—do more to help residents of Rockland and Westchester.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation/state/community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Recovering from the public health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have put together a detailed plan to help New York families and businesses get back on their feet. We need to establish universal coronavirus testing and guarantee free treatment for anyone with COVID-19 symptoms, build a reliable stockpile of personal protective equipment and take care of vulnerable seniors with delivered meals, case management, homecare services, and increased staffing in nursing homes. To help provide relief for workers businesses we need to secure financial relief for all those negatively impacted by the economic slowdown by waiving state income taxes on unemployment and federal stimulus payments, expand zero interest loans and grants that cover fixed costs and payroll for small businesses and push for tax deferrals, rental assistance and eviction protection for businesses struggling through the crisis.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am the only candidate running with experience in local, state, and federal government, having worker for Congresswoman Nita Lowey, Congressman Eliot Engel, former Orangetown Supervisor Andy Stewart, and now serving as a Nyack Village Trustee and the Legislative Director for State Senator James Skoufis. My Albany experience means I'll be able to hit the ground running representing the people of the 38th district in 2021.
I am also the only candidate with a detailed policy platform and stances on the important issues in the race. Neither of the other candidates has released any information about their platform or positions on the issues. I have also received far more endorsements (more than 70) from current and former elected officials, candidates, party and community leaders, unions, and progressive groups.
There is a significant difference between me and my opponent Justin Sweet on the issue of gun safety. While I have been designated by Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety as a ""Gun Sense Candidate of Distinction,"" Justin has a history of troubling ties to the NRA and affiliated groups, having attended local NRA fundraisers, and being supported by leaders in the local NRA affiliate, United Sportsmen Association of Rockland. The Journal News covered this story: https://www.lohud.com/story/ne...
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)
There is no incumbent in this race.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
Education - As a former teacher, I know the importance of education funding. Schools across the 38th district are struggling to find the funding they need to provide students with the education that they deserve. New York State has continually failed to deliver on its promise to fully fund the Foundation Aid program that is supposed to guarantee fair funding to all of our school districts. I will fight for fully funding foundation aid so we can make sure the kids in our community get an excellent education without needing to further raise property taxes on local taxpayers.
Property taxes - Property taxes in Rockland and Westchester Counties are some of the highest in the country. I strongly support maintaining the property tax cap that limits the growth of property taxes and will protect the STAR program from any changes or reductions. Since the bulk of the property tax bill for families in the 38th Senate District goes towards school district taxes, my plan to direct more state funds to local school districts means property taxpayers will get a break. I will also fight for a state fund to help local governments find ways to share services and consolidate operations to save money for taxpayers. And at a time when so many people have lost jobs or seen their hours cut back, I believe we need a comprehensive state plan to help people who could be in danger of losing their homes to eviction or foreclosure after the current moratoriums on evictions and foreclosure expire.
Environment - There is no greater threat to our long term future than climate change. If we don't take this threat seriously, rising temperatures and rising sea levels will ruin ecosystems, damage our agricultural production, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in flood damage in New York over the coming decades. In 2019, New York passed the most aggressive climate legislation in the nation, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). Elijah believes that we must move quickly to implement the provisions of the CLCPA and provide new funding to develop renewable energy sources and protect coastal communities from the worst impacts of rising sea levels. We don't have to choose between a cleaner, more sustainable future and economic growth--a green economy will be a prosperous economy.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My extensive record in state, local, and federal government working for other elected officials and understanding the way the process works, and my background in regional planning all have prepared me for this job.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Treat others the way you'd like to be treated. I always try to live by the golden rule.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I believe you shouldn't go into politics unless you enjoy working with people and truly want to help them. I'll always have an open door policy and make myself accessible to anyone with questions or concerns. Representing the residents of the district I grew up in would be the greatest honor of my life. I ask for your support in the Democratic Primary on June 23.

Both her grandfathers died of COVID-19 during the pandemic.
Her paternal grandfather lived in Rockland County. The disease came on so quickly the family didn't have time to get him to the hospital. Her maternal grandfather lived in Brooklyn. He was hospitalized for 20 days, with no one allowed to visit.
""It was a mess specially at the beginning,"" Gottesfeld told Patch. ""My father, as a precaution, had to self-isolate.""
The first shock was losing her dad's dad March 28. ""My cousin just got engaged virtually. We all thought he would be there.""
The other got sick in March and died April 13. ""It's always different when you don't get to say goodbye,"" she said. ""I was talking to my grandmother on the phone and she was crying. 'They're not letting me in.' All she wanted to do was be there for him.""
Both in their late 70s, they were very different, but both were giving men who worked hard through their lives to provide stable homes for their families, she said.
""Going through the experience you really feel the pain of others. It makes me have an increased desire to really represent people,"" said Gottesfeld, who lost her 17-year-old brother two years ago to cancer. ""It's an emotional ride. The reason I started the campaign was because of times like these. It only makes me fight harder.""
Better preparation for pandemics and more scientific research could have made a difference in finding ways to fight the outbreak and care for patients, she said.
Gottesfeld faces Maureen McArdle Schulman of Westchester County in the Republican primary June 23. They both seek to replace retiring Rep. Nita Lowey, longtime congresswoman and current chair of the Appropriations Committee. The winner will face the winner of the 8-way Democratic primary.
The 17th Congressional District includes all of Rockland County and much of Westchester, including Peekskill, Yorktown, Ossining, New Castle, Mount Pleasant, Tarrytown, White Plains and Harrison."

The sale of the three Rockland properties, for which officials said in 2019 they were hoping to get up to $100 million, would help with the college's financial difficulties.
The South Nyack board voted Tuesday to reject the college's request to amend the special permit it received long ago. The area around it is zoned single-family residential and the special permit allows the 107-acre campus to be used for educational purposes.
In its request, the college said it wanted the permit changed to allow higher residential density on about half the main property on behalf of a prospective buyer. The college did not say who that buyer might be. The plan includes selling off existing houses on campus and converting existing buildings such as dormitories into multi-family housing, the Rockland Business Journal reported.
As residents agitated to know the identity of the prospective buyer, Mayor Bonnie Christian issued a statement Wednesday.
The college relocated to Rockland County from Manhattan in 1897. In addition to the campus in South Nyack, its Alliance Theological Seminary has a 37-acre campus on Route 9W in Upper Nyack, and the college owns a 22-acre parcel in Orangetown where its president lived.
College officials re-established a city campus in 1997. The college bought space near Battery Park in 2016 and began creating dorms in Jersey City.
When the college made its announcement at the end of 2018, county and local officials immediately met to discuss a comprehensive approach to ensure appropriate development. SEE: Rockland Officials Meet On Nyack College Closing.
While village law does not allow a special permit to be amended, college officials could apply for a new special permit or request re-zoning, according to the Rockland Business Journal."

Andrew Cuomo said Friday.
Speaking at his daily news briefing, which he held at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, Cuomo said there have been 73 reported cases in New York of children ill with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome.
Calling it ""painful news,"" Cuomo said ""We were led to believe that the good news about this virus was that it didn't affect children.""
According to doctors in Westchester County, 11 children have been hospitalized at the Maria Fareri Children's Hospital with the multi-system inflammatory syndrome. Most tested positive both for COVID-19 and new coronavirus antibodies. Most did not become seriously ill right after they had been exposed to or infected with the virus, but began getting sick up to a month later. They ranged in age from infant to teenager.
Parents should remain vigilant and seek care immediately if their child has symptoms, Cuomo said.
Cuomo reported that the total number of hospitalizations was down statewide, to 8,196, with about 600 new cases entering the hospital per day. A total of 216 new deaths were reported statewide over the past 24 hours.
Health officials had hoped that the number of cases would keep declining, but hospitalizations daily have instead been steady, and projections suggest that there will still be new hospitalizations for COVID-19 every day in June, he said.
Cuomo said he doubted that a dramatic change in the statistics would loosen up restrictions downstate after May 15, when the executive order that sent New Yorkers home will expire. Upstate communities will begin to reopen their economies, however.
Most of the new hospitalizations are occurring in New York City, on Long Island and in southern Westchester County. Most are in communities with higher-than-average minority populations.
State health officials are asking hospitals to report more details about new hospitalizations as they work to cut the number of new infections further."

Governor Cuomo's proposal to merge the state Bridge Authority and Thruway Authority is an opportunity to streamline government services by bringing together two organizations with overlapping roles and resources. There will be no disruption to the operations of the Bridge Authority: tolls will continue to be kept among the lowest in the nation, serving the authority's operational and capital needs and keeping its long-term capital plan intact.
Both authorities operate roads and bridges. They keep roads in good repair, ensure bridges are structurally sound and clear snow in the winter. Bringing these authorities together will streamline administrative functions to reduce duplication, achieve economies of scale in purchasing and contracting and deliver savings to toll payers.
Thruway is also converting completely to cashless tolling by the end of 2020, while the Bridge Authority is planning to move forward with the initiative at its crossings. A merger between the authorities would allow an experienced team at the Thruway to efficiently and effectively implement cashless tolling at the Hudson Valley bridges moving forward. In addition, both authorities use E-ZPass for tolls, and the Thruway Authority already processes the Bridge Authority's E-ZPass transactions and issues its E-ZPass tags. Streamlining these duplicative processes just makes sense.
The Thruway Authority collects approximately $800 million in revenue annually and the Bridge Authority about $62 million. While the two authorities will merge operationally, their revenue and how it is utilized will – and must be – invested to support their operations and capital programs.
Under Governor Cuomo's leadership, all of us across New York State government are constantly re-examining how we do business to improve efficiency and lower costs. Government should work for the people, and it should do it at the lowest cost possible on behalf of hard-working New Yorkers. This merger is just the latest example of that effort as we continue to strive to make New York State a better place to live, work and raise a family.
Matthew J. Driscoll
Executive Director of the New York State Thruway Authority

Nita Lowey in New York's 17th Congressional District. Gottesfeld will seek the GOP line on the ballot in November.
She's the third Republican to announce her candidacy, joining Josh Eisen and Jarred Buchanan. There are 14 Democratic candidates.
The 17th Congressional District includes all of Rockland County and much of Westchester, including Peekskill, Yorktown, Ossining, New Castle, Mount Pleasant, Tarrytown, White Plains and Harrison.
Rockland residents running for the seat include Gottesfeld; Mondaire Jones of South Nyack, a 32-year-old former litigator in the Westchester County Law Department and former Department of Justice staffer during the Obama Administration; David Carlucci, a state Senator; and David Katz.
Gottesfeld attended Rockland Community College and graduated from the City College of New York with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering.
Among the issues she is most concerned about: making taxes fairer; supporting parents' choices about where to send their children to school; using the free market to reduce health care costs; and keeping America safe.
She told Gateway Pundit: ""The Democrats have left many behind by embracing socialism and abandoning support for Israel. I'll work every day to empower Americans to improve their lives and to stand up to radical liberals like Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez whose extremism is out of touch with the values of average Americans.""

Nita Lowey is retiring. They held a recent rally in Nyack.
The group, called No IDC in DC, opposes Carlucci because of his membership in a breakaway group of Democrats who caucused with Republicans in Albany before shutting down in 2018.
The newly formed coalition includes 16 groups with a reach of well over 100,000 members, its founders said. Most are in Westchester and Rockland counties.
""We formed because we are concerned that a state senator who happily betrayed his party and voters for over seven years as he caucused with Republicans in the state senate, could now represent CD17 in Congress.,"" said Paul Diamond, a founding member of No IDC in DC. ""With so many qualified Democrats running for Ms. Lowey's seat, we do not trust that Mr. Carlucci will not once again betray his voters should the next shiny object and opportunity appear.""
The eight-member Independent Democratic Conference allied itself with Senate Republicans from 2011-18. That gave the GOP control of the chamber and to some extent endowed its members with power and influence. In 2018 its leadership patched up differences with the Democratic leaders in the state Senate and dissolved.
No IDC in DC, which represents a wide spectrum of the Democratic Party and its voters, is not endorsing any specific candidate in this race, its leaders said. The coalition is encouraging voters to learn more about each of the candidates, and provides links on its website to help educate voters about all other NY CD 17 candidates.
Since Lowey announced her plans to retire, almost 20 candidates have announced they would run for her seat."

It's part of the village's broader vision of a public riverwalk, and will also create more parking for the always-busy park.
The flat wooden footbridge has been designed for ease of access and to minimize its profile against the view of the Hudson River from the Nyack shore, Village Administrator Jim Politi told reporter Pete Kramer.
The marina's parking lot is next to the village parking lot once used by the River Club, which has been torn down. There hasn't been much interest expressed in replacing the restaurant, Politi said.

The district includes the towns of Clarkstown, Orangetown, Ramapo, and, across the Hudson River, Ossining.
The incumbent, State Sen. David Carlucci, is running for Congress. Reichlin-Melnick seeks the Democratic line on the ballot.
""I'm running for State Senate because we need state government to work for regular people, not just the wealthy and the well-connected,"" said Reichlin-Melnick. ""In 2019 the new progressive majority in Albany started delivering for everyday New Yorkers. I'll continue pushing for bold change, while making sure state government protects our quality of life by ensuring safe neighborhoods, clean water, good roads and mass transit, and a well-funded public education for our kids.""
The 35-year-old has lived in Rockland County nearly his entire life and steadily built his experience in public service with work as a constituent service specialist and district representative for Congressman Eliot Engel and Congresswoman Nita Lowey and the Executive Assistant for former Orangetown Town Supervisor Andy Stewart.
Since 2017, he has served Nyack as an elected member of the Village Board of Trustees. His priorities there include keeping the Village budget under the State property tax cap, promoting affordable housing, and standing up against over-development.
He began his career as an elementary school teacher at an inner city school in New Haven, CT. More recently, he served as a Senior Research Planner at Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, a non-profit focused on regional planning and local government issues throughout the Hudson Valley.
Now Reichlin-Melnick is the Legislative Director for State Senator James Skoufis.
""Our region faces many challenges,"" said Reichlin-Melnick. ""Sky high property taxes, rising rents, and burdensome healthcare costs. We're struggling to retain businesses. School districts like East Ramapo and Ossining aren't getting the education funding they deserve. Commuters in Rockland lack access to convenient mass transit. State government can—and must—do more to help residents of Rockland and Westchester. As our next State Senator, I will always fight for our communities, because I believe government exists to serve the people, not the powerful.""

The single most pressing issue facing our community, and what I intend to do about it.
Maintaining and protecting our quality of life. This is a broad umbrella and includes ensuring that our Town and Village building and zoning codes are enforced, ensuring that the County Planning Department is diligent and supported by the County Legislature and Executive; working with local residents and elected officials to ensure reliable County-wide transportation; fighting for issues that ensure the public health, safety and welfare of our County residents, and fighting to protect our environment against the effects of pollution, climate change and loosening federal protections of air and water.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I offer a reality-based set of specific solutions to the problems our County is facing. Unlike my opponent and the Rockland GOP, I don't pledge to ""Save Rockland by selling the Sain Building."" Instead, I offer concrete, realistic, real-life ideas on what we can do, as elected officials and as residents, to confront our problems and preserve our County. Examples include: find ways to empower the County Planning Department to have greater authority over building and code enforcement at the Village and Town levels, such as through the creation of a Rockland County Development Commission; develop alternative local and County-wide development protections such as the creation of Historic districts and a County-wide Water District; strengthen the relationship between law enforcement at the County level and building code enforcement and prosecution; offer free workshops to local residents on local planning, zoning and how municipal government works; sponsor a County-wide summit/intervention, which would be a series of workshops and meetings to openly discuss the issues facing our County and reach community consensus on how to confront our challenges and solve our problems.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
My platform is defined by my Democratic values which then translate into my priorities which result in reality-based actions. My platform is: 1) STOP irresponsible development; 2) PRESERVE AND PROTECT our environment; 3) IMPROVE intra-County and commuter transportation; 4) SUPPORT organizations, groups and activities that bolster our communities and uphold our values.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
As Chair of the South Nyack Planning Board I stood up to developers and enforced our building and zoning codes. As Councilwoman in the Town of Orangetown I spear-headed and passed a local law that required enhanced notification to neighbors whenever a zone change was proposed. As County Legislator since 2012, I sponsored and successfully passed a bi-partisan law banning plastic bags in Rockland County; I sponsored and successfully passed a bi-partisan memorializing resolution in support of a Monitor for the East Ramapo Central School District; I sponsored and successfully passed a local law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in our pharmacies; I successfully worked with local residents and elected officials to get the NYS Thruway Authority to listen and respond to residents' concerns about the proposed location of the TZ Bridge Shared Use Path; I fought to keep County taxes low, support deficit reduction, endorse fiscal integrity, all while maintaining quality County services.
The best advice ever shared with me was …
From Harry S. Truman: ""America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand. It's amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.""
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I support building strong local communities through responsive and transparent government, positive action, and encouragement of grass roots activities and upholding the values of fairness, equality and truth. I try to live this statement as a person and as an elected official every day. If you ask people who have worked with me, I hope you will find they tell you that I succeed."

Previously on Patch:
The single most pressing issue facing our community, and what I intend to do about it.
The corruption, lawlessness, and overbuilding emanating out of Ramapo is an existential threat to Orangetown and Clarkstown.
I plan on using every possible part of our county government against these abuses, as well as using my public office to appeal for help from other layers of government to assist in stopping this abuse.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
My opponent has been compliant with the Ramapo machine's wishes, and silent in the face of that machines misbehavior, for seven and a half years.
She has recently found a very small voice against these issues, this when I emerged as a formidable opponent and a obvious threat to her holding that seat.
In office, I will be resisting all of the corrupt Ramapo machines efforts at controlling or harming Clarkstown and Orangetown, I will offer that corrupt machine no political cover, and I will in fact use my seat to broadcast any misdeeds by that machine rather than remain silent.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)?
My opponent has been silent in the face of public corruption, public school looting and the general mistreatment of Rockland residents that is threatening to consume Orangetown and Clarkstown.
This has been a absolute failure as to what should have been the behaviors of the person in that seat.
The man who was President of the East Ramapo School Board, Aron Wieder, who looted that public school district, and who sold the buildings off at a discount to his friends' ""private schools,"" was voted Rockland County Legislature Majority Leader by my opponent, this after that looting by him was well known to those even remotely connected to Rockland politics.
My opponent voted against Israel's right to exist.
My opponent voted to ask for the release of Domestic Terrorist and essentially triple cop killer Judith Clarke.
My opponent is chair of the Rules Committee, and by her own admission, ruled out putting term limits up for a real vote until after the election.
My opponent killed a memorializing resolution meant to support Legislature Laurie Santulli who was a victim of a bizarre hate crime.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Each county in NY is responsible for coming up with its own water. It is not the state's job to solve that problem.
Rockland will with absolute certainty run out of water if the overbuilding continues.
It is also a fact that there are frequent sewage treatment plant overflows into the Hudson, measured in millions of gallons.
I have no interest in drinking desalinated sewage, nor do the voters I speak with.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
As an experienced and licensed psychotherapist I am accustomed to hearing distorted versions of reality that need correction if the person is to function well.
Our current leadership in the Rockland County Legislature is distorting reality and speaking about matters in a self serving way.
We need someone to show up in the Rockland County Legislature and speak to what is real, rather than a self serving distortion of what is actually occurring.
The best advice ever shared with me was …
""Play the tape till the end."" Meaning if you are about to do something, slow down and think about how that will actually play out.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?

Previously on Patch: Rockland Candidate Profile: Vivian Street For County Legislature
The single most pressing issue facing our community, and what I intend to do about it:
Public corruption resulting in a panoply of problems including, especially in Ramapo, disregard for housing and fire codes, disregard for the NYS Education Law (hurting public and private school children), and systemic abuse of welfare and Medicaid entitlement programs, all of which I intend to address if elected DA.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidate seeking this post?
My opponent has never prosecuted or defended a criminal case, and yet has been chosen (by the political elites and special interests?) to be on the Democratic AND Republican AND Conservative lines on the ballot.
I have prosecuted and defended criminal cases; I have tried and appealed civil cases, in representing people in employment law and civil rights cases; I have fought for taxpayers; I have 3 times influenced the US Supreme Court; and I have served in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan (where I was awarded the Bronze Star Medal) after which I retired in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform:
I have grass-roots support as an independent candidate. My opponent won the Democratic primary by receiving the ultra-Orthodox ""Bloc vote."" He is a life-long Democrat, and yet is also on the Republican and Conservative lines. It appears that he is beholden to many interests.
I am beholden to no political or special interests. As DA, I will be independent of political or other special interests. And I will seek to protect the interests of ALL of Rockland's residents.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
Retired as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Judge Advocate General's Corps; prosecuted and defended criminal cases; and litigated cases at the trial and appellate levels in both federal and state courts. Influenced the US Supreme Court in 3 different cases (two of which were advocacy in favor of taxpayers and the public interest).
The best advice ever shared with me was ...
Always act with integrity.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I am running because Rockland County is like the ship Titanic, heading toward icebergs (corruption, non-transparency, development issues, children's education, welfare abuse, RLUIPA lawsuits) and I, as an experienced employment law/civil rights lawyer, a retired military officer and a believer in our American Constitution, have the vision and the skill to help steer our ship Titanic to safer waters.

The Associate Press called the race in Jones' favor Tuesday.
In a news release, Jones, 33, of South Nyack, said he was honored to announce he has secured the nomination to replace outgoing Rep. Nita Lowey, who said she was retiring at the end of this year.
""From the start, I have said that I am running for Congress because, for me, policy is personal,"" he said. ""We get better policy outcomes when our elected officials have lived experiences that give them a personal understanding of the policies being debated in the corridors of power, and a sense of urgency to implement big, structural improvements.""
Jones said he received more than 32,000 votes — or more than 42 percent of the ballots cast.
He said that, growing up poor, black and gay, he never imagined someone like him could run for Congress, let alone win.
Jones is a former litigator in the Westchester County Law Department and former Department of Justice staffer during the Obama administration. He has degrees from Stanford University and Harvard Law School.
He will be facing Republican Maureen McArdle Schulman, 61, of Shrub Oak, on the ballot in November.
The New York Working Families Party State Director Sochie Nnaemeka called Jones' victory ""yet another signal that New York's multiracial progressive movement is growing — and here to stay.
""We were proud to stand with Mondaire on the campaign trail, and we look forward to supporting this Working Families Party champion as he brings his transformative vision to Washington,"" she said. ""From protests to the polls, New Yorkers are making clear we refuse to settle for the status quo — we want bold, progressive leaders fighting for us in Congress.""

He faces Republican William Weber in November in the race to see who will represent the oddly drawn district that includes all of Rockland County plus a tiny section of Westchester across the Hudson River.
Though the primary was June 23, actual counting of absentee ballots did not start until last week. State election officials said county boards of elections received a historically high number of absentee ballots for all the June 23 primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic. The counting didn't start until after the last mail-in stragglers arrived (absentee ballots postmarked by June 23 must be received by the Board of Elections no later than June 30 to be counted) and challenges to some ballots were resolved.
The counting of over 12,700 absentee ballots late Thursday gave Reichlin-Melnick a 921-vote lead over opponent Justin Sweet, who was ahead after in-person voting.
On election night, the state board's interim tally showed Sweet ahead with 6,482 votes to Reichlin-Melnick's 4,594 and Francois' 2,933. But with nearly 17,000 absentee ballots to count, campaign officials believed that the absentee ballots would change the outcome.
""I want to thank Justin Sweet and Eudson Francois for joining me in this race and giving voters a choice in this primary. To all the voters who supported Justin and Eudson, I promise to work hard to unify our party,"" Reichlin-Melnick said in a press release. ""Now I'm ready to continue fighting for the people of Rockland and Westchester in the general election in November!""
He has served as a Nyack Village Trustee since 2017. Now the Legislative Director for State Senator James Skoufis, who represents parts of Rockland, Orange, and Ulster counties, Reichlin-Melnick worked as the Executive Assistant for Orangetown Town Supervisor Andy Stewart, and managed Stewart's successful re-election campaigns in 2013 and 2015.

The top item on the agenda is a resolution to hire an appraisal firm to set a current value on part of Nyack College's 107-acre property, Graystone Valuation Group based in Bedford, New York.
The board has already voted unanimously to retain a lawyer to represent it in matters pertaining to the sale of the college, William P. Harrington of Bleakley Platt, based in White Plains, New York and Greenwich, Connecticut.
While the college has not stated publicly who the prospective buyers are, they have widely been reported to be interested in turning at least part of the college into a yeshiva. According to the Rockland Business Journal, the partnership includes a Ramapo yeshiva and condo developer Berel Karniol.
The Nyack College campus, which has more than 40 buildings including dormitories and classrooms, would house 200-300 students, and the plan would be to start as a boys' school and transition to a family yeshiva, the business journal reported.
Karniol, a Monsey resident, controls dozens of companies in Rockland County and was featured in a 2017 special report by The Journal News called ""Ramapo Nears Breaking Point.""
Village officials want Graystone to evaluate the section of the property that includes the college's sports complex.

The petitioners needed 192 signatures to meet the state's requirement that 10 percent of the electorate sign. It had 250.
Under state law, now that the village clerk has certified that the petition has enough signatures, the village board has 30 days to enact a resolution calling for a referendum and set the date, which must be between 60 and 90 days after their vote.
While the village board does not have the petition on its agenda for Tuesday night's meeting, it is planning to appoint Michael Lockett to the position on the board of trustees that opened up when Nancy Willen resigned. He has been a member of the South Nyack Planning Board.
The movement started after Nyack College sold much of its campus to a Ramapo-based yeshiva. SEE: Nyack College Sold To Yeshiva Viznitz For Religious School.
Nyack College ceased operations in Rockland County at the end of 2019. The college has long had a permit to operate an educational campus in a residential area.
This spring, college officials applied to amend the permit to allow higher residential density on about half the main property on behalf of an anonymous prospective buyer. The plan was to build multi-family housing. Village trustees rejected the request because village law doesn't include a process to amend a special permit.
The sale of the college campus and the call for dissolution have drawn attention from pundits outside the village."

About 1.3 million New York customers experienced power outages during the Aug. 4 storm; most were without power for several days.
In an unprecedented move, the New York Department of Public Service sent Notice of Apparent Violation letters to Con Ed, O&R, CenHud and the cable, phone and internet provider on Wednesday, telling the companies that they face steep fines and also that they must take immediate corrective actions so that similar failures are not repeated during the remainder of hurricane season.
This is the first time the department has front-loaded the investigation process with Notices of Apparent Violation. They have also tightened that process, vowing to be finished in six months instead of the usual one to two years.
Plus, the department is threatening to pursue franchise revocations for Con Edison and Orange & Rockland.
""The response to Tropical Storm Isaias by the electric utilities was completely unacceptable,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday in announcing the violation notices. ""Fifteen days later and we are still hearing complaints from families and businesses.""
Con Edison said its response was good, given the impact of the storm. ""Our storm response plans enabled us to restore more than 300,000 customer outages from Tropical Storm Isaias more than two times faster than after Winter Storms Riley and Quinn and 1.5 times faster than Hurricane Irene,"" spokesman Allan Drury said Wednesday.
Specifically, DPS cited Con Edison and Orange & Rockland for inaccurate communications, website problems and inadequate pre-staging. Central Hudson was cited for inadequate communications capacity at its backup data center, leading to their website becoming unavailable to customers.
The department identified several potential violations related to Altice-Optimum's storm response in the lower Hudson Valley and Long Island, including a failure to coordinate emergency response with local officials, communications failures and insufficient generator capacity for their network.
The Department letter demands that Altice-Optimum promptly remedy the problems and provides notice that its investigation will include a review of whether the company is in violation of the commission's 2016 order approving its acquisition of Cablevision.
The immediate corrective actions must include:
""We are focused on continuously improving,"" Drury said. ""We are enhancing our reliability, resiliency and storm response in a variety of ways, including implementation of a resilience plan. That is essential at a time when climate change is making severe weather events more frequent and devastating for our customers.""

The board, which meets Thursday evening, now includes Mayor Bonnie Christian, Deputy Mayor Alain Leinbach and Trustees Catherine McCue and Andrew Goodwillie.
Willen was halfway through her second term and trying to sell her house, The Journal News reported. The village's Democratic Committee is seeking nominations of people to run for the last year of the term. Already on the ballot in November are Leinbach and Goodwillie, who face challenges from Jeff Hirsch and Michael P. Hogan.
The village is poised for more change, as Nyack College is selling most of its campus to a Ramapo-based yeshiva reportedly connected to developer and Rockland resident Berel Karniol.
Nyack College ceased operations in Rockland County at the end of 2019. The college has long had a permit to operate an educational campus in a residential area. In March village officials turned down the college's application to amend the permit to allow higher residential density on about half the main property.
The college has an 107-acre campus in South Nyack, affiliated Alliance Theological Seminary has a 37-acre campus on Route 9W in Upper Nyack, and the college also owns a 22-acre parcel in Orangetown where its president lives.
College officials re-established a city campus in 1997. The sale of the Rockland properties, for which officials are hoping to get up to $100 million, would help with the college's financial difficulties.
The village has hired an appraiser to look at the sports complex.
The advent of a large yeshiva and Karniol's reported involvement have sparked concern in South Nyack, where some residents are worried about the possibility that Ramapo's longstanding development, education, financial and corruption issues would spill into the tiny community. A movement to dissolve the village was reported by The Journal News.

Check out Patch's full Q&A with Elijah Reichlin-Melnick:
Why are you seeking elective office?
I love the Hudson Valley. Growing up in Nyack, I know the beauty and opportunity that Rockland and Westchester counties have to offer. Fresh air, clean water, safe neighborhoods, and an excellent education for our kids - these are some of the many reasons why families choose to make their homes here. Our communities represent the American dream to so many families. These are the values of the Hudson Valley, and that's what I'll fight for as our next State Senator.
Although Rockland and Westchester remain wonderful places to live, our region faces many challenges. Property taxes are some of the highest in the nation. Rents are rising rapidly, and healthcare costs are an enormous burden on many families. We're struggling to retain businesses. School districts like East Ramapo and Ossining aren't getting the education funding they deserve. Commuters in Rockland lack access to convenient mass transit. And now at a time when people are struggling more than they have in nearly a century because of a pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis - it is time that we take a stand and fight for the people of Rockland and Westchester counties.
It is time that our representatives in state government do more to help residents of Rockland and Westchester. It's time to make New York not just a beautiful and prosperous place to live, but an affordable one, too. It's time to make New York work for everyone, not just the wealthy and the well-connected.
I started my career as an elementary school teacher. I've worked in the private sector as a regional planner and researcher into government efficiency. I've served our community as a staffer to a Town Supervisor and to two members of Congress. I'm currently an elected Village Trustee in Nyack and have been working as Legislative Director for State Senator James Skoufis.
Now, I'm stepping up to serve the people of the 38th District in Clarkstown, Orangetown, Ossining, and Ramapo as our next state senator, and fighting to make sure that New York works for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation/state/community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our communities in Rockland and Westchester is the coronavirus pandemic. Over 200,000 Americans have died, and while New York has been able to limit the spread of the virus, the infection rate is now on the rise again locally and the cold weather will likely bring a second wave with it.
The most important thing we have to do right now is protect the health of our citizens. We also must provide economic relief to the thousands of New Yorkers who are out of work, and the thousands of small businesses who have been hit the hardest by fallout from the COVID pandemic. To fully cope with this public health and economic crisis, I believe we need bold action to help residents and businesses who are struggling through this unprecedented time.
It starts with providing universal free testing and treatment for coronavirus for all New Yorkers - because the quickest way to fix our economy is to get the virus back under control and stop the spread. We must eliminate income taxes on unemployment benefits to help the thousands who have lost their jobs. We must provide zero-interest loans and grants to small businesses to keep them afloat and to keep their staff employed. We must provide tax-breaks for local property taxpayers who are struggling to keep their homes, and we must make sure that billionaires in New York who have increased their wealth during the pandemic by unimaginable sums finally pay their fair share to help balance the budget. This is only the tip of the iceberg - you can read my full plan at elijahforsenate.com/covid19
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidate seeking this post?
While I have years of experience crafting policy, finding potential tax savings for residents, and helping solve problems for people in our community, my opponent has never been elected to public office, or been responsible to the public in any way.
I have directly outlined my priorities and identified specific ways I will address key issues as our next State Senator. I have concrete plans to achieve my goals and I know how to pass laws in Albany - because I have helped do it before working as the Legislative Director for State Senator Skoufis. My opponent has only made himself clear on one thing - that he opposes the progress that we have made in New York State since electing a Democratic majority to the State Senate. At a time when healthcare, women's reproductive rights, and the environment are at stake in a right-wing Supreme Court, New York must continue to protect our rights and freedoms.
I have also received far more endorsements (more than 90) from current and former elected officials, community leaders, labor unions, and grassroots organizations - including 19 major labor unions representing millions of workers and working families across the state of New York.
I have a plan to help New York rebuild and recover from the COVID pandemic, deliver tax relief for property taxpayers, and fully fund our public schools - and I have the experience to get it done from day one.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
Education - As a former public school teacher, I know the importance of education funding. Schools across the 38th district are struggling to find the funding they need to provide students with the education that they deserve. New York State has continually failed to deliver on its promise to fully fund the Foundation Aid program that is supposed to guarantee fair funding to all of our school districts. I will fight for fully funding foundation aid so we can make sure the kids in our community get an excellent education without needing to further raise property taxes on local taxpayers.
Property taxes - Property taxes in Rockland and Westchester Counties are some of the highest in the country. I strongly support maintaining the property tax cap that limits the growth of property taxes and will protect the STAR program from any changes or reductions. Since the bulk of the property tax bill for families in the 38th Senate District goes towards school district taxes, my plan to direct more state funds to local school districts means property taxpayers will get a break. I will also fight for a state fund to help local governments find ways to share services and consolidate operations to save money for taxpayers. And at a time when so many people have lost jobs or seen their hours cut back, I believe we need a comprehensive state plan to help people who could be in danger of losing their homes to eviction or foreclosure after the current moratoriums on evictions and foreclosure expire.
Environment - There is no greater threat to our long term future than climate change. If we don't take this threat seriously, rising temperatures and rising sea levels will ruin ecosystems, damage our agricultural production, and cause hundreds of billions of dollars in flood damage in New York over the coming decades. In 2019, New York passed the most aggressive climate legislation in the nation, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). I believe that we must move quickly to implement the provisions of the CLCPA and provide new funding to develop renewable energy sources and protect coastal communities (including the Hudson River coastline) from the worst impacts of rising sea levels. We don't have to choose between a cleaner, more sustainable future and economic growth--a green economy will be a prosperous economy.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My extensive record in state, local, and federal government working for other elected officials and understanding the way the process works, serving as an elected Village Trustee in Nyack, and my background in regional planning and policy research have all prepared me for this job. I am ready to fight for the people of Rockland and Westchester on day one in Albany.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Treat others the way you'd like to be treated. I always try to live by the golden rule.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I'm a pragmatic progressive who believes government exists to protect our quality of life, and to ensure safe neighborhoods, clean water, good roads and mass transit, and a well-funded education for our kids. Government exists to serve the people, and improve all our lives. That's what I'll fight for.
I believe you shouldn't go into politics unless you enjoy working with people and truly want to help them. I'll always have an open door policy and make myself accessible to anyone with questions or concerns. Representing the residents of the district I grew up in would be the greatest honor of my life. I ask for your support in the General Election on November 3, or through early in-person voting between October 24 - November 1, or by mail at absenteeballot.elections.ny.gov. If you need more information about my positions or want to reach me to ask a question please visit my website (www.elijahforsenate.com) or email me at elijah4senate@gmail.com."

In People v Christopher Taggart, a case involving correctional staff bringing contraband into the Rockland County Jail, prosecutors said they sought to protect the identities of witnesses from being exposed because of the risk of threats, intimidation, or harassment from members of correctional staff and inmates.
The County Court denied the application, claiming they had failed to show ""particularized facts supporting good cause"" for a protective order, Rockland District Attorney Thomas Walsh said.
The DA's office appealed, and Justice Paul Wooten of the Appellate Division held that ""County Court improvidently exercised its discretion"" in summarily denying the District Attorney's application and ordered attorneys' eyes only disclosure.
In People v Armando Zayas, the County Court summarily denied the District Attorney's application to protect the identity of a confidential informant from exposure. The judge effectively ordered immediate disclosure of ""all discovery, including, but not limited to audio/video evidence and witness information"" pending a suppression hearing.
However, Justice Joseph J. Maltese of the Appellate Division found the ""County Court improvidently exercised its discretion"" in summarily denying the District Attorney's application, and ordered attorneys' eyes only disclosure ""until the commencement of the trial.""
""These two appeals were a necessity. My office will fight to the bitter end to protect the identity of witnesses, confidential informants and undercover officers,"" Walsh said in a statement. ""I commend the hard work by Senior Assistant District Attorney Jacob B. Sher for his diligent and meticulous legal work on these appeals."""

Check out Patch's full Q&A with Mondaire Jones:
Why are you seeking elective office?
I'm running for Congress because, for me, policy is personal. I know what it is like for a working family to struggle and rely on government assistance to survive, and I am going to bring those lived experiences with me to Congress.
My story, quintessentially, is that of the American Dream. I grew up in the working-class Village of Spring Valley, where I was raised by a young, single mom who, like so many women throughout my district, and all throughout this country, worked multiple jobs just to provide for our family—even as we relied on Section 8 housing and food stamps. When we talk about the fight for a $15 minimum wage at the federal level, that fight is personal for me.
My mom got help from my grandparents. My grandfather was a janitor at our local middle school, and later, he was a small business owner. My grandmother cleaned homes, and when day care was too expensive, she took me to work with her. Now, I get to run to represent the same people whose homes I watched my grandmother clean growing up. And when we talk about the need for universal child care, that's a fight I'm invested in based on not wanting any kid to have to experience what I did growing up.
After my grandfather died of cancer, I watched helplessly as my grandmother had to work well past the age of retirement just to pay for the high cost of prescription drugs and medical procedures not fully covered by Medicare as we know it. I believe health care should be a human right in the richest nation on Earth, not tied to employment status or how much money one possesses.
I'm 33 years old. I remember what it's like to be a broke college student, because for me, that wasn't so long ago. The fact is, this country has failed its young people. Thousands of people in my district, my age and younger, despite having college degrees, are still living at home with their parents because they can't afford to pay rent or own a home. We were told that if we just went to college and graduated like our parents may have, things would work out. But we know that that's not true. Part of that is due to low wages in this broken economy -- wages that have been stagnant for decades as the cost of living has soared -- but it's also due to a student debt crisis to the tune of $1.7 trillion. I propose tuition-free public colleges and universities and forgiving college debt to liberate an entire generation of people to meaningfully participate in our economy.
Saving the planet from climate change is personal for me. My generation is inheriting a planet that stands to be devastated by climate catastrophe because people who have been in office for a really long time have failed to act with the kind of urgency the issue requires.
We have never been at a moment in American history when we have more urgently needed people in office for whom policy is personal. I think we get better policy outcomes when people are able to bring their lived experiences to inform the policymaking process. Moreover, representatives like me can be trusted to always fight for the best interests of their constituents, even when the doors are closed in the halls of Congress and those constituents can't see what we are doing. That's also why, unlike my opponents, I refuse to accept money from corporations.
The fact is, I've been fighting my whole life. First, it was against the odds of my upbringing, to the point where I was able to make it to Stanford University, work in the Obama Administration at the Department of Justice (vetting candidates for federal judgeships and working on criminal justice reform), and then attend Harvard Law School. More recently, after co-founding a nonprofit that teaches professional skills to underserved middle-school students, I have served as a lawyer in government, fighting in the courtrooms of Westchester County on behalf of the people of Westchester. Now, I'm running to fight for all of the people in this district in the halls of Congress.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation/state/community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation is the failure of our democracy, and my first order of business will be to fix it.
Who would have thought we would be approaching a time when the President of the United States would refuse to concede his loss in an election and attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power? That is precisely what Donald Trump has threatened, and given what we know about him, we must take his threat seriously.
There's no question that our democracy is thoroughly broken. In many states, gerrymandering produces uncompetitive campaigns and results that do not reflect the will of the people. Our campaign finance system operates so that, overwhelmingly, the candidates who make it onto the ballot and win elections are captured by corporate interests and wealthy donors. Tens of millions of eligible voters are unable to meet overly restrictive registration deadlines.
That's why I support the For the People Act (H.R. 1) to counteract a decades-long, undemocratic, right-wing assault on our democracy. The legislation includes measures like automatic voter registration to add nearly 50 million voters to the rolls, campaign finance reform to reduce the outsize influence of big money, independent redistricting to end partisan gerrymandering, and prohibitions on voter suppression.
As long as our democracy remains rigged, real change -- health care for everyone, environmental reforms, gun safety legislation, dismantling systemic racism, and strengthening reproductive justice -- will remain out of reach.
It's time to take our democracy back from billionaires and special interests, and I am ready to lead that fight.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am the only candidate in this race who believes that health care is a human right, and that we should be insuring more people, not less. I am the only candidate in this race who has serious proposals to stop climate change while creating millions of good-paying jobs. I am the only candidate who would protect a woman's right to choose by codifying Roe v. Wade, and who supports universal child care, an issue that is deeply personal for me and which would help so many families throughout our district. And I am the only candidate who wants to bring down the cost of living in Rockland and Westchester, to make this a more sustainable place to live for people of all ages.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
A Green New Deal, as outlined in H.R. 109, to tackle climate change at the scale that it requires. That would allow us to meet the goals of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and avert the worst of climate catastrophe -- while providing millions of good-paying jobs that undo generations of environmental injustice.
Universal child care, including co-sponsoring the Universal Child Care and Early Learning Act (H.R. 3315), and supporting paid parental leave.
A major investment in affordable housing, including co-sponsoring the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act (H.R. 1737) and repealing the Faircloth Amendment.
A $15 minimum wage, and raising the federal poverty line.
Fully funding our public schools, including increasing Title I funding for our most impoverished schools, as well as increasing funding under Titles II and IV and fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act.
LGBTQ+ rights and equity, including co-sponsoring the Equality Act (H.R. 5).
College debt relief and tuition-free public college, in order to liberate an entire generation of young people to meaningfully participate in our economy through homeownership or renting.
A suite of criminal justice reforms to redress racial inequalities and harms in our justice system, including repealing the 1994 crime bill that fueled mass incarceration, eliminating mandatory minimums in sentencing, legalizing cannabis, and banning the box in employment applications.
Reproductive justice, which includes a constitutional amendment and federal statute to codify Roe v. Wade, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and ensuring comprehensive sex education.
Comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for our undocumented community, as well as co-sponsoring the DREAM Act (H.R. 6) and ending family separation.
Disability rights, including expanding Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income to end the backlog of 800,000 cases, and ending the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My time in the Obama Administration, where I worked in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice on criminal justice reform and judicial nominations (including now-Supreme Court Justice Kagan), helped me engage with and learn the inner-workings of our federal government and gives me a keen understanding of how to make policy at the federal level. As a lawyer in the Westchester County Law Department, I worked on and won some of the County's biggest cases, and am also proud of drafting legislation and helping the Westchester County Human Rights Commission respond to the uptick in acts of hate in Westchester. My work co-founding a national nonprofit called Rising Leaders, which teaches professional skills to underserved middle-school students and has gotten two grants from the Gates Foundation, has given me hands-on experience in improving the lives of our most vulnerable young people, and insight into what interventions will work best. My activism with the Spring Valley NAACP Youth Council to pass a public school budget in the East Ramapo Central School District while I was in high school, and as a former committee chair on the NAACP's National Board of Directors, has given me invaluable experience organizing residents at the local level for important causes, in addition to substantive policy experience nationally.
And I have already demonstrated an ability to organize my community to stand up to systemic racism: as a senior in college, after the Palo Alto Police Chief made comments embracing racial profiling, I successfully organized my fellow students and Palo Alto residents to pressure the department until she resigned and we obtained policing reforms.
I also believe that governing is a moral endeavor as much as it is a technical one, and that your personal experiences inform how hard you fight, and what you fight for. We need more elected officials for whom policy is personal - people who share the lived experiences of so many regular Americans who have to struggle to make ends meet, who have crippling student debt, who have experienced daily the realities of structural racism and inequality. As an attorney, I understand the laws that govern our society - and as a black, gay man and young person, I understand on a personal level how unjust laws affect people's lives. I am running for Congress to fight for a better world for everyone.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Growing up in the Village of Spring Valley, my mother told me that I could be anything I wanted. It was a radical idea. My mom, who struggled with mental illness, had dropped out of college and was working multiple jobs just to make ends meet — even as we relied on Section 8 housing and food stamps. But I took her advice, and I dreamed big. She opened my world to a universe of possibilities that would have been unthinkable for most people born into my circumstances. That's why I am drawn to public service: because every kid in this district should be able to dream big. My story should not be the exception.

SEE: Dissolving South Nyack: Village Board Calls Special Session

South Nyack is a village within the town of Orangetown. Three other incorporated villages in the town are Nyack, Grand View-on-Hudson and Piermont.
There are 10 unincorporated communities in Orangetown, including Blauvelt, Upper Grandview and Pearl River. Its total population of roughly 49,000 is served by a full list of departments including the Orangetown police, who already handle policing for the village of Nyack.
Living in an incorporated village, the 3,500 residents of South Nyack have their own government, including building and public works departments, local court and police force, which they share with Grand View. They have use of some town services, including parks and recreation.
In another layer of government, there are also two school districts serving the area, with their own structure and property taxes: Nyack and South Orangetown.
Residents who want to end the village-level layer of local government, leaving just the town of Orangetown, filed a petition with enough signatures to force a referendum. The success of the petition drive put the trustees on a timetable set by state law. SEE: South Nyack Residents To Vote On Dissolving The Village
A similar process is going on in Dutchess county, where the village and town of Pawling are considering consolidation. Benjamin Syden, the consultant in that process, told Pawling residents in a presentation Aug. 25 that 21 villages in New York have dissolved themselves since 2010, when legislation was passed in Albany to make it easier.
Some New Yorkers hold strong opinions about the layers of local government under which they live. In South Nyack, proponents of dissolution have said among other things that they want to save taxpayer money by eliminating duplication of services. Opponents have said among other things that they fear services would not be as good under the town government.
A galvanizing issue is the sale of part of the Nyack College campus to a Ramapo-based yeshiva and developer. Yeshiva officials have said that initially they want to offer a high-school and college for 500 students. SEE: Nyack College Sold To Yeshiva Viznitz For Religious School.
Some in South Nyack say they don't want the kind of issues Ramapo wrestles with between its burgeoning Hasidic community (there are 25,000 students in the East Ramapo school district who attend the Ultra-Orthodox community's private schools, compared to under 9,000 children who attend the public schools) and the non-Hasidic community. The issues include taxes, services, safety, development and corruption. SEE: Rockland Leaders Grapple With Development, Anti-Semitism."

Also, a New York voter may vote in person even after casting an absentee ballot. That is another reason why absentee ballots cannot be counted until after all in-person votes are cast.
The oddly-drawn district includes all of Rockland County and, two miles across the Hudson River, the town of Ossining in Westchester County.
According to the New York Board of Elections, as of 10:04 a.m. Wednesday, Weber had 47 percent of the vote and Reichlin-Melnick had 44 percent.
Weber was doing better in the Rockland part of the district, where there are 172,369 active registered voters, according to the NY BOE. With 97,009 votes counted, Weber held 49 percent of the Rockland vote to Reichlin-Melnick's 42 percent. Eight percent of the Rockland ballots were blank in the race.
In the Westchester sliver of the district, where there are 23,018 active registered voters and 12,732 votes were tallied, Reichlin-Melnick had 62 percent of the votes tallied to Weber's 30 percent.
Weber, 51, is a Certified Public Accountant. He has been the CFO of a privately held company since 2000. His wife, Lisa Weber, is the acting superintendent of the Suffern Central School District.
""The truth came out today in the votes,"" Weber said on election night in a speech posted on Facebook. ""We're overwhelmingly optimistic that when all the absentee ballots are counted we will be victorious.""
On election night, Reichlin-Melnick said there were nearly 40,000 outstanding absentee ballots, with Democratic ballots outnumbering Republican ballots by more than 3-to-1. ""Now we have to ensure that the remaining votes are counted and the will of the voters of the 38th District is respected,"" he said.

41,/new-york/newcity/letter-editor-deeply-reduce-mcb-tolls-rocklanders,2020-10-22T17:41:55Z,Letter to the Editor: Deeply Reduce MCB Tolls...,1,1,Lanning Taliaferro,Patch Staff,"To the Editor:
Here are the comments I submitted to the New York Thruway Authority about the proposed toll increases.
Members of the Thruway Authority Board, as many of you are aware, I have stated throughout my administration that any increased toll for the new bridge must include a reduced toll rate for Rockland residents. While it is heartening to see a Resident Discount Program in the Thruway Authority's Proposed Toll Schedule, the proposed discount rate of $4.75 is simply not low enough. The resident rate should be a significant discount, well beyond the one provided for other E-ZPass® holders. Instead, the proposed Resident Discount is the same as the current Standard NY E-ZPass® toll. In 2021, it would be just 50 cents less than the NY E-ZPass® toll, and in 2022, just one dollar less than the proposed Standard NY E-ZPass® toll. I request your consideration of a significantly lower resident toll rate – one more in line with the Commuter E-ZPass® toll of $3.00.
I have also said for many years that the cost of the new bridge must be shared by everyone along the Thruway system, just as the revenue the old bridge generated for decades went to support the entire Thruway system. I would, therefore, call for a portion of the increased toll revenue that will be generated by the proposed toll increases along the length of the Thruway system be dedicated to the new bridge. This is especially appropriate, given that toll revenue collected on the old bridge was used for many years to plug the financial hole of the Canal Authority. Those funds should have been used to pay for the new bridge and hold down tolls.
I am pleased to see that tolls on the new bridge for commercial vehicles are increasing and that there will still be a discount for NY vehicles. However, as I have requested in the past, and in order to protect and improve the economic health of our region, I ask that the Board establish a lower toll discount for commercial vehicles registered to Rockland County employers.
Regarding the proposed commercial toll increases, it is also vital that the Thruway Board hold firm and approve the proposed increases and not reduce or eliminate them, as has happened on far too many occasions in the past. As a reminder, commercial tolls have only increased by an average of about 3% per year for the past 20 years. The peak NY E-ZPass® toll for a 5-axle vehicle, for example, has only increased from $20 to $32.75 since 2000. The dramatically increased truck traffic traveling through Rockland and across the bridge is a direct result of the extremely low commercial vehicle tolls. There is no question that it is well past time that the commercial toll rates for out of state vehicles crossing the bridge be dramatically increased.
As always, transit improvements must also be a priority for this corridor and for Rockland County, which is tremendously underserved by regional transit systems. Therefore, I would ask that the Board create a dedicated Transit Fund in which a portion of bridge toll revenue is set aside for transit capital improvements between Rockland and Westchester.
Finally, I would request that the Board approve the toll increases for the new bridge with a requirement that the revenue collected at the bridge be dedicated to the bridge and only the bridge. The Tappan Zee Bridge was a cash cow for the Thruway for decades, second only to the Woodbury to Buffalo trips in toll revenue. But the vast majority of that money was spent somewhere else. We can no longer allow revenue generated at this Hudson Valley crossing to be spent elsewhere. $152 million a year in tolls – nearly 20 percent of all annual toll revenue collected by the Thruway Authority – can go a long way to paying bridge costs and keeping tolls from increasing in the future.
I appreciate the Board's consideration of each of these requests, made on behalf of Rockland County residents and business owners.
Sincerely,
Edwin J. Day
Rockland County Executive"

Ahead of the vote, the village hired consulting firm CGR Promising Solutions to conduct an impact analysis study.
The study analyzed how the dissolution would impact the village and its residents, including financial impact, political representation and how services would be provided.
Here are the key takeaways of the analysis, which can be viewed in full here.
The analysis also found elected positions in South Nyack would be eliminated, and that the six full-time and 10 part-time police positions would be eliminated and replaced with 5 full-time officers.
It also found the city's current outstanding debt of $975,000 would remain the responsibility of village properties and not the town as a whole until expired.
Lastly, a resident's vote would go from about one in 1,900 to about one in 38,000, decreasing each voter's political sway.
According to the CGR, an informational question-and-answer session will be held on Zoom on Dec. 3 at 7:30 p.m.
The dissolution vote will then be held on Dec. 17 from noon to 9 p.m. at Living Christ Church in South Nyack.
Should residents vote to dissolve the village, its board must begin the planning process. If the vote fails, the village is not permitted to consider another petition for dissolution for four years.
A summary of the study can be read online."
