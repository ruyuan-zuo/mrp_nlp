Her candidacy was unanimously endorsed May 20 by the Fairfield Republican Town Committee.
""I am honored to have the opportunity to run for the Connecticut General Assembly at a critical time for our state where bipartisan, out-of-the-box thinking and leadership is needed, especially in the days and months ahead of us following the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Romano-Csonka said in a news release. ""... I want to bring creative and common-sense representation where I will be unafraid to challenge to the status quo.""
Additionally, on May 21, state Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey was unanimously nominated by the Democratic Town Committee to run for re-election representing District 133. First elected in 2014, McCarthy Vahey serves on the General Assembly's Government Administration and Elections Committee and the Planning and Development Committee, and co-chairs the Transportation Committee.
""I love our town: the natural beauty; our amazing libraries; our two universities and incredible school system. But most of all, I love the people, you, my neighbors and constituents,"" McCarthy Vahey said in a news release from the committee. ""It is my passion for the people of Fairfield and our state, along with my compassion for the hurt in a world that needs healing, that calls me to continue my service.""
Romano-Csonka, a former Norwalk resident, previously served on Norwalk's Common Council from 2005 to 2013. Romano-Csonka has been a member of the Fairfield Affordable Housing Committee since December. If elected to the state House, she would work to amend the state's affordable housing laws and make them fairer to local municipalities, according to the news release announcing her candidacy. The 67-year-old also hopes to be a strong advocate and voice for seniors, as evidenced by her years as an in-home caregiver for the senior community.
""We need to address issues such as making Connecticut a healthy place to do business with especially now, stop the tax-and-spend, ask questions later mentality and fix unfair housing laws like 8-30g that favor predatory developers, not homeowners which continues to have implications on our town,"" she said in the news release.
Romano-Csonka has volunteered with AdoptaPlatoon and organizations dedicated to missing and abused children. A mother and grandmother, she invented a ""keep them safe"" car seat, which contains an alarm system to keep young children safe from the hazards of extreme temperatures. She has also worked in sales and as an assistant to several Fairfield County attorneys.
A trained social worker, McCarthy Vahey co-chairs the Fairfield Cares Community Coalition and is a certified suicide prevention trainer. She served previously on Fairfield's Representative Town Meeting and as a Fairfield selectman. McCarthy Vahey lives in Fairfield with her husband, a U.S. Navy veteran, and their three children.
The election is set for Nov. 3, with primary petitions due June 9 and primaries planned for Aug. 11."

""Connecticut is beautiful and underappreciated, and our State and our District deserves representatives that will sow the seeds of a vibrant renewal with active leadership and a clear vision for the future,"" Volpe said in a news release.
Also last week, state Rep. Laura Devlin, who has held the seat in District 134 since 2014, received the Republican endorsement to seek re-election

2,/connecticut/fairfield/5-story-apartment-building-planned-downtown-fairfield,2020-05-27T22:22:47Z,5-Story Apartment Building Planned For Downtown,0,33,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — The view of Fairfield from a passing train could be about to change, as a five-story affordable apartment building is planned for a site near the downtown station.
Developer Fairfield Station Lofts LLC on Tuesday presented its proposal for apartments at 78 Unquowa Place to the Town Plan and Zoning Commission.
""We anticipate that all these units, be they affordable or market rate, are going to be very, very attractive,"" said attorney John Fallon, who represented the developer during the hearing, held via teleconference.
The proposed project, called Fairfield Station Lofts, would include a 31,298-square-foot building with 26 apartments on the 0.32-acre triangular lot, currently occupied by a single-family home built in 1884. The site neighbors the train tracks and downtown station, as well as a pediatric health center. The planned approximately 65-foot building would have a ground-floor parking structure with 27 spaces, and four stories of apartments.
The units would range from one bedroom to three bedrooms, and would vary in size from about 800 square feet to about 2,200 square feet. Four apartments would be designated for people earning less than 60 percent the statewide median income and four would be for those earning less than 80 percent of the statewide median income, according to Fallon.
""I don't have to belabor the need for affordable housing,"" he said.
The zoning application for Fairfield Station Lofts was made under state law Section 8-30g, which dictates the only way the commission could deny the proposal is by proving it poses a threat to public health, welfare and safety that outweighs Fairfield's need for affordable housing. Section 8-30g applies to towns where less than 10 percent of housing stock meets state criteria to be recognized as affordable. According to Fallon, 2.6 percent of Fairfield housing stock is affordable.
The town's Affordable Housing Committee had a favorable response to the project after a presentation in December, Fallon said, adding the building is intended to attract young adults, empty nesters and commuters.
Architect Rich Granoff told the zoning commission Tuesday that the building will have a light gray brick facade with metal paneling, oversized closets in the apartments, and a roof deck with dining areas, a fire pit and grilling stations.
""The views from the rooftop here are really spectacular,"" he said.
The principle on the project is Matt Finkle, who is also involved in the development of another downtown apartment building, a 13-unit complex at 1675 Post Road, which is already under construction.
Commission members asked the presenters about the project's construction process, the building design, the landscaping, emergency vehicle access, parking and traffic.
During public comment, nearby property owner Carey Mercurio expressed concern that parking from the apartment building would overflow into his lot.
Finkle responded that because the development plans to target commuters and empty nesters, he didn't think it would be an issue.
""It's a manageable situation,"" Finkle said. ""… This is a transit-oriented property."""

Leeper, a member of the school board, also ran for the seat during a special election in January, which she lost narrowly to state Rep. Brian Farnen, who received the Republican Town Committee's endorsement Wednesday.
""While on the one hand, it feels like the special election was just yesterday, it also feels like that was a lifetime ago,"" Leeper said in a news release announcing her endorsement. ""We have all been impacted by COVID-19 in many ways and our days no longer resemble anything that we are used to. Despite all of this change, stress, and turmoil, one thing has remained and that is my commitment to listening, bringing humanity to our discourse, and thoughtful policies that put people first. If anything, my commitment to these values has only grown in the past three months.""
The nominating meeting, usually held in person, was conducted over conference call because of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has proven to be a challenging time to launch a campaign. Leeper can't go door-to-door to meet her neighbors and discuss community concerns in person, something she enjoyed during her last campaign. Fairfield had a 29 percent voter turnout then, and Leeper remains optimistic about increased voter engagement in November, according to the news release.
""People are hungry for hope again — I know I am,"" Leeper said in the news release. ""This pandemic will likely be a part of our lives for the foreseeable future and when the next steps are not clear we need leaders in Hartford who trust the science, make data-driven and compassionate decisions for our families, our businesses, and who can communicate transparently with our community.""
Leeper is determined to find solutions that will bring the community together after the pandemic, and believes that people want someone working on their behalf who listens to them and proposes solutions, according to the news release.
""We all need to listen better. It's the only way to build understanding and replace fear with compassion. We need to find a way back to each other, so we can strengthen our connections and end this radical division,"" she said in the news release
Leeper lives in Fairfield with her husband and two children. She is a former partner at 475 Consulting, and she's committed to ensuring that residents and small business owners have a voice and collaboration with a representative in Hartford who understands their needs and concerns, according to the news release.
""Our post-COVID world will be different than it was before,"" she said in the news release. ""We have a unique opportunity to thoughtfully evaluate exactly the kind of world that we want to return to, and I will fight for that more just, empathetic, and collaborative future."""

Brian Farnen was unanimously endorsed Wednesday night by the Fairfield Republican Town Committee to run for re-election in the 132nd district.
In his acceptance speech, Farnen pledged to continue to work to rebuild Connecticut's economy and help small businesses get back on their feet, bolster the state's public health system, and revitalize and modernize the state safety net infrastructure after its greatest stress test in modern history, according to a news release announcing the endorsement.
Farnen underscored how he wanted to prioritize education so teachers, students and parents are provided with the tools and flexibility to transition back to school in the fall, and fight attempts to solve the budget crisis through new taxes on working families, the news release said.
The Fairfield Democratic Committee on Thursday endorsed school board member Jennifer Leeper, who ran against Farnen in a special election in January, to seek the seat.
Farnen is a former member of the Representative Town Meeting and succeeded First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick in serving the 132nd district. As a new legislator, Farnen was assigned to the education, transportation, and finance, revenue and bonding committees.
""It's been an honor to serve the 132nd district, and with the pandemic, the job of state representative has taken on a more important role — from helping local businesses with federal aid programs to helping constituents navigate their unemployment claims as they work through an antiquated state bureaucracy — to helping seniors receive facial masks and volunteering at weekly community food drives,"" Farnen said in the news release. ""In these challenging and very different times, now more than ever, we need common-sense solutions that are grounded in transparency and collaboration, not politics.""
Professionally, Farnen works as general counsel and chief legal officer of the Connecticut Green Bank. Farnen earned his law degree and master's degree in business administration from the University of Connecticut School of Law and School of Business, respectively.
""Brian Farnen has delivered on his promise to represent the residents of the 132nd district with honesty and passion,"" Kupchick said in her nominating speech, according to the news release. ""Since winning the special election in January, Brian hit the ground running listening, learning and leading on issues important to Fairfielders. I couldn't be more proud of the representation Brian has provided and his help for residents with state-related problems. I'm looking forward to Brian's continued good work on behalf of the residents in the 132nd district.""
Farnen and his wife are the parents of two children who attend Fairfield Public Schools. He is an active parent at Roger Sherman School, and volunteers on the Sherman PTA Executive Committee and as a youth soccer, basketball and football coach for his children."

Farnen, a Republican, defeated Leeper, a Democrat, by less than 100 votes four months ago in a special election to fill the seat after its former occupant, Republican Brenda Kupchick, resigned to become Fairfield's first selectwoman.
In discussing their campaigns Monday, both candidates referenced the coronavirus outbreak, which is associated with more than 3,400 Connecticut deaths in two months and has resulted in the closure of schools and non-essential businesses.
""In these unprecedented times, there is no playbook on how you run for reelection,"" Farnen, an attorney for the Connecticut Green Bank and former Representative Town Meeting member, said in an op-ed submitted Monday to the Fairfield Patch. ""I could not in good conscience focus on politics and qualifying to run for office until it was absolutely necessary because I did not feel comfortable doing so when self-promotion or politics should be the last thing on our minds.""
Farnen said he has been helping residents with unemployment claims amid ""an antiquated state bureaucracy"" and answering questions from small businesses about how to get assistance. His future legislative priorities include rebuilding the economy, strengthening public health and providing teachers and students with tools to transition from remote education back to classroom learning.
Leeper, a Board of Education member and former partner at 475 Consulting, in the last election prioritized strengthening education, investing in infrastructure and incentivizing job growth.
""The need for good, honest, courageous leadership that is focused on science has never been more important,"" Leeper said Monday. ""The idea that all we need is less government to be freer has just been exposed as untrue.""
Fairfield's Republican Town Committee will hold its nomination Wednesday for the 132nd district. The Democratic Town Committee's nomination will be Thursday. Both events will take place remotely as a precaution against the virus."
7,/connecticut/fairfield/millions-cuts-fairfield-budget-amid-coronavirus,2020-05-12T07:50:49Z,Millions In Cuts To Fairfield Budget,0,25,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — Fairfield's Board of Finance made millions in cuts Monday to a town budget written in a pre-coronavirus world.
The board was presented with a $327.38 million budget and accompanying 2.46 percent tax increase that was approved by selectmen in early March. By the end of Monday's four-hour meeting, the estimated tax increase had dropped to about 0.4 percent. The board's actions saw the budget decrease by $9.09 million, to $318.29 million, a $1.89 million year-over-year increase, according to information provided Tuesday by Budget Director Linda Gardiner.
""This was horrible,"" said board member John Mitola, a Democrat. ""It was hard to do.""
The budget season occurred during the spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,000 people across Connecticut since March and resulted in the widespread closure of schools and businesses. It has also made for an unusual budget process, with public comment possible only through email, and budget meetings, including Monday's, held via teleconference.
""This was definitely not a normal budget season,"" said Vice Chair Christopher DeWitt, a Republican.
While the board's vote Monday to approve the budget as amended was unanimous, many motions that passed throughout the evening fell along party lines, with the board's three Democrats voting in the minority.
Among the approved cuts were millions in revenue adjustments recommended by department heads. The board was presented with $2.68 million in cuts, but approved $2.31 million, opting to maintain revenue for the building department and fire marshal fees as originally presented.
The board also cut $2.29 million from the Board of Education budget as a result of $325,000 in pension savings, a $468,000 bus contract reduction and $1.5 million to be allocated as part of a non-lapsing account.
The non-lapsing account is also expected to include $1.8 million intended for costs associated with the virus outbreak such as computers and protective equipment. DeWitt said he did not want to see the school board use funds outside the account to pay for virus expenses.
Public works was among the town departments to see significant cuts, including a $334,000 capital reduction, a $300,000 fleet maintenance cut and $1 million in paving that was eliminated, but that the board discussed funding through a bond resolution.
""We need to tighten our belts and empathize with the general public right now,"" board member Edward Bateson, a Republican, said.
Fairfield's main and branch libraries received a combined $300,000 in cuts, while the Pequot Library evaded a proposed $50,000 reduction. The fire and police departments saw more than $260,000 combined in capital cuts.
Several jobs were eliminated as well, among them a new business development director position that came with a $130,000 salary and a $35,000 grant writer job.
""It's just not a year to be adding positions into town hall,"" board member James Walsh, a Republican, said.
Payroll was also reduced in the fire and building departments. The position of director of the Bigelow Center was cut from $66,000 to $32,000.
Now that the Board of Finance has made its adjustments, the budget will go the Representative Town Meeting for a final vote June 1. The town meeting is authorized only to lower budget appropriations. Once the budget is approved, the Board of Finance will set the mill rate for the town."

Having served as the former fire chief/emergency management director for the Town of Fairfield, Connecticut, from 1998–2015, I was dismayed to read that a Board of Finance member would insult the men and women of the emergency services at a recent town meeting. To suggest that the overtime spent on the police officers and firefighters throughout the COVID-19 response shows a lack of understanding of the emergency services and its responsibilities.
Fairfield Union To Board of Finance Member: Apologize Or Resign>>>Read More.
Throughout many town difficulties, including Super Storm Sandy, I saw firsthand the dedication of the members that make up these two departments. Each day they work selflessly, not knowing if they will return home safely to their families. During a time of extreme crisis, they go beyond, working tirelessly to protect and aid the citizens of Fairfield and those who pass through town. The safety and well-being of Fairfield always comes first to these committed town employees. The amount of overtime paid is not a clear reflection of the time that has been devoted.
I have seen firsthand how many after-hours emails, phone calls and planning sessions are held that are not compensated for because these honorable people are not looking to hurt the town financially, but rather to help it in a time of need. The compensation they receive is more than fair based on the time they dedicate to creating, implementing and enforcing safety standards. I have known many emergency responders that take less compensation because they feel that providing their expertise is the right thing to do for the greater good. Even administrative assistants from these departments have sacrificed time with their families for the betterment of this community in support of the first responders, because we are truly a team of benevolent people first.
I am proud and honored to have been a part of such a dedicated team for 57 years. I was also fortunate enough to reside in Fairfield and reap the benefits of their service. The entire emergency service team, including the members of the ambulance services and dispatchers, work persistently to make things right for the rest of us, oftentimes at the expense of their own understanding, caring families at home.
Driving down the Post Road you may not see these men and women in action. To think that means crime and fires aren't happening, that planning and implementing policies aren't taking place, that non-COVID-related medical calls aren't occurring, is nothing more than naive. People should not need to ""see"" behind the scenes to appreciate what is happening. They should trust the administrators of these departments and realize that the emergency services are made of people who chose to work toward the greater good when they made these positions their career.
The people of Fairfield are fortunate to have compassionate responders keeping them safe both in the background and in the eyes of the public. Fairfield is equally lucky to have dedicated volunteers that support the efforts of career responders. That camaraderie makes living in Fairfield so special. Please do not take it for granted.
Sincerely,
Richard Felner

Board Chair James Brown began a meeting Tuesday by defending the board's prerogative to probe town spending, while acknowledging offense was caused by member James Walsh's remarks at a meeting April 29. Both meetings were held via teleconference due to the ongoing new coronavirus outbreak.
""We will continue to ask difficult questions regarding the budget and related town finances,"" Brown said. ""Every board member needs to feel comfortable and confident doing just that in a respectful manner.""
Walsh, a Republican, had been asking about nearly $60,000 in police and fire overtime incurred as of mid April because of the virus outbreak when he said police overtime seemed to be ""out of control"" and added there was ""no crime going on in town.""
""You drive through this town at night, you can't find a cop. It's a ghost town,"" he said, a remark that was followed by laughter on the teleconference recording.
Several days after the April 29 meeting, the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1426 suggested Walsh's comments were political and asked him to apologize or resign. The police union, Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Local 550, called Walsh, ""uninformed and thoughtless."" Walsh did not respond at the time to emails seeking comment.
Brown, a Republican, said he and board Vice Chair Christopher DeWitt, also a Republican, spoke with the police and fire chiefs regarding the matter. Brown went on to clarify that the laughter heard on the recording from April 29 came from town administrative employees, who had since apologized to the police and fire unions. Brown also said he had tried to cut short the conversation between Walsh and town administrators.
""Offhanded comments or remarks do happen, and whether taken out of context or said in an inappropriate manner, they cause hurt feelings, misunderstandings and offense,"" Brown said Tuesday. ""To the extent that this happened in our last meeting while discussing overtime expenses related to the COVID crisis, I apologize as chairman of this board."""

The task force, led by First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick, is discussing how restaurants, retailers, salons and other businesses covered under the order will be affected. The town is seeking clarification and guidance from the office of Gov. Ned Lamont, which it hoped to have by late Wednesday.
""I know our residents are rooting for Fairfield restaurants and all our local retail shops and businesses to get through this, so we can all enjoy a meal out again, and return to normal, even if it looks a little different than it used to,"" Kupchick said in a town news release. ""Safety remains our priority, but we want to do what we can as a town to support our businesses.""
The task force brings together the town health, zoning, economic development and building departments as well as the fire marshal's office, police department and the Fairfield Chamber of Commerce. The task force is seeking ways to streamline processes and allow greater flexibility for restaurants that want to expand their outdoor footprint, as the May 20 order allows for outdoor dining only.
""I know restaurants are struggling and many have done an extraordinary job revising their operations and adapting to new regulations during the pandemic,"" Kupchick said in the news release. ""The governor's executive order allows for restaurants to expand their outdoor footprint and while this doesn't work for every business model, we want to do everything we can to support our restaurants.""
In addition to widespread business closures, school buildings across the state are shuttered for the remainder of the school year while students learn from home. More than 2,700 Connecticut residents have died after contracting the virus, according to the most recent state data.
A call with restaurant owners is scheduled for Friday, according to the news release. If restaurants have questions about expansion, they should contact the Town Plan & Zoning Department at 203-256-3050 or jwendt@fairfieldct.org. Businesses seeking guidance should contact the Office of Community & Economic Development at 203-256-3120 or mbarnhart@fairfieldct.org."

One union has asked board member James Walsh to apologize or resign.
""We find it difficult to understand how an individual who speaks so negatively about the Town's employees, holds such an important position within our Town's government,"" the Fairfield police union said in an open letter Friday.
Walsh, a Republican, made the incendiary comment at a meeting Wednesday during a discussion of expenses incurred due to the virus. Among the roughly $210,000 in virus-related expenses accrued by the town as of April 15 was nearly $60,000 in police and fire overtime, according to a town document.
Walsh asked Interim Chief Finance Officer Caitlin Bosse for specifics on the cause of the fire department's overtime before turning his attention to overtime at the police department.
""The police overtime seems to be out of control when there's no crime going on in town,"" he said in the final minutes of the second of two board meetings Wednesday evening.
The meeting took place via teleconference, and was recorded and posted online by FairTV. Based on the length of the board's meetings Wednesday, it appears Walsh made his remarks just before midnight.
Walsh feared police overtime could reach $100,000 or more by May 15, he said, adding he wanted an explanation for the overtime.
""You drive through this town at night, you can't find a cop,"" he said. ""It's a ghost town.""
Following Walsh's remark, laughter can be heard on the teleconference recording.
In a news release posted Friday on Facebook, the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 1426 suggested Walsh's comments were political and asked him to apologize or resign.
""During the 4/29 meeting, he insulted the men and women who provide public safety to the Town,"" the news release said. ""… As he kept speaking, he proved he lacked even a basic understanding of what has gone into the countless hours of work by our Fire and Police Departments.""
Walsh did not respond Friday afternoon to emails seeking comment on the news release.
The police union, Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Local 550, called Walsh, ""uninformed and thoughtless,"" before reporting its members made more than 500 criminal arrests in 2019 and that so far in 2020, each month's arrests have exceeded those of the previous year. In the past two months, the department has investigated untimely deaths, sexual exploitation of a minor and heroin distribution, according to the union.
""It is apparent that Mr. Walsh has no perception of the reality in which he lives, the reality that is Fairfield,"" the union's letter said. ""… crime occurs, and the fact that a town representative is so naive to this fact is not just stunning, it's concerning."""

As is often the case with residential projects in Fairfield, much of the Town Plan and Zoning Commission's discussion centered around affordable housing. While property owner Black Rock Realty LLC proposed that 10 percent of the complex's units be priced below market rate, commissioners considered raising that number as high as 15 percent, before eventually settling on 12 percent.
Black Rock Realty objected to the increase on the grounds that no comparable developments in town are asked to designate more than 10 percent of their apartments below market rate, estimating that raising the requirement to 15 percent would cost the company $10.4 million over 40 years.
""Just because it's been 10 percent in other areas doesn't mean that we can't make it a different number here,"" Chair Matthew Wagner said during Tuesday's meeting, held via teleconference.
Commissioner Thomas Noonan said the switch to 12 percent should be a starting point in terms of future expectations concerning affordable housing in zoning applications.
The Metro Center site at 219 Ash Creek Blvd. includes 10 acres of property available for development as well as a conservation easement with lowlands and walking trails near Ash Creek. A former metal foundry, the property has since been razed and remediated, and was purchased about 20 years ago by Black Rock Realty, but has remained undeveloped for well over a decade, despite the approval of a proposal in 2005.
""It's been fallow for 20 years,"" Wagner said. ""The idea that we're waiting for the better project to come along, I think, is getting very old, and we now have for the first time in two decades a developer with a plan who is prepared to invest in our town and to build what our own consultants have told us is the highest and best use.""
The proposal includes 357 apartments — mainly studios — and a 118-room hotel, according to town documents. Black Rock Realty intends to begin by erecting one of the apartment buildings, then the hotel, followed by another two apartment buildings, at which point the developer must seek permitting from the town to build additional commercial space before constructing the last two apartment structures. For the commercial projects, the owner is proposing a concourse building for the nearby Fairfield Metro train station and a secondary retail building.
""I think the need for residential to generate demand for commercial seems like a sound premise,"" commissioner Lenny Braman said.
Vice Chair Mark Corcoran expressed concern that the proposal didn't present a true mixed-use community and that the development was too isolated from the train station.
""I'm kind of disappointed in the vision of this development,"" he said. ""… They're asking us to change our zoning specifically for them to do this and I think there could be a lot more.""
Nonetheless, all commission members in attendance voted to approve zoning amendments as well as a special permit and site plan for the project, with conditions recommended by town staff.
Attorney Bill Fitzpatrick, who represented Black Rock Realty before the commission, said after the meeting that while the owner is eager to move forward, economic uncertainty in the wake of the new coronavirus outbreak makes it impossible to estimate a timeline for construction.
""The virus is going to affect everything at this point,"" Fitzpatrick said."

""I know you are eager to return to normal, but we have to rely on the guidance of health professionals as we move forward,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said during a news conference streamed via Facebook and the town website.
Fairfield's open spaces have been closed since mid March as the virus has spread across Connecticut. As of Wednesday, there were 373 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in town and 47 Fairfield residents had died after getting the virus, according to state data. However, 157 residents had recovered as of Wednesday, according to Health Department Director Sands Cleary, who said the virus peaked locally around April 14, with new cases and related hospitalizations on the decline since then, leading the town to start gradually lifting recreation restrictions.
""We're looking to allow people to access our open spaces in a safe way that's governed by data and not by emotion,"" Kupchick said Monday at a Board of Selectmen meeting.
On Friday, the five town beaches on the Long Island Sound will reopen, but group activities and gatherings will not be allowed, nor will beach chairs, blankets or coolers, according to an email Kupchick sent Wednesday to residents. Parking will be limited and available only to town residents with a valid beach sticker from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at Sasco, Jennings and Southport beaches.
South Benson Marina and Ye Yacht Yard will open Friday as well. Only vehicles with M stickers will be allowed at the marina parking lot, while residents with a valid beach sticker will be able to access Ye Yacht Yard.
Also Friday, Lake Mohegan will reopen, with parking available 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. for those with a beach sticker or other proof of Fairfield residency. Dogs must stay on leash and the cascades lot will be closed.
The H. Smith Richardson Golf Course will remain closed pending construction in the parking lot, but the Carl J. Dickman Par 3 will open Friday with online tee times only. Carts will not be available.
All other parks and open spaces will stay closed, and officials warned residents that the limited reopenings come with conditions.
""We must remember to still practice proper physical distancing,"" Chief of Police Christopher Lyddy said, adding people who are vulnerable to the virus should avoid public spaces. ""… Please continue to make prudent and cautious decisions.""
Kupchick told selectmen Monday that signs will be posted to remind residents of the proper protocol and said if the public doesn't follow precautions, the open spaces could be closed again. She said Wednesday police will enforce safety protocol and encouraged residents to wear face coverings and maintain 6 feet between themselves and others. For several weeks in April while recreation areas were closed, people who entered parks and beaches risked a $92 fine and police patrols were dispatched to the areas specifically to enforce the closures.
""This is really about a community response,"" Selectwoman Nancy Lefkowitz said Monday. ""… The more compliant we are the sooner we will be able to get back to some semblance of normalcy.""
School buildings, businesses and other facilities shuttered due to the virus will stay closed, according to Lyddy.
""This virus is so incredibly contagious and any one of us could have it without symptoms,"" Kupchick said Wednesday.

Fairfield officials discussed loosening the rules about outdoor spaces during a news conference Thursday and in an email to residents. First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said in the email details about the plan will be announced early next week, adding the town intends to limit certain spaces to Fairfield residents only and encouraging Fairfielders to get up-to-date beach stickers.
""The approach we are taking is data driven and will not be governed by emotions,"" Kupchick said in the email.
In early April, the town announced that residents using the closed parks and beaches would receive a $92 fine and sent patrols to recreation spaces to enforce the closures. Chief of Police Christopher Lyddy said at Thursday's news conference the department will increase traffic patrols in town as pedestrians on the sidewalks and streets have complained about cars speeding and disobeying traffic laws.
Fire Chief Denis McCarthy said at the news conference that the town's easing of outdoor restrictions will not affect the recommendation that residents keep 6 feet away from people outside their household and wear a face mask in public.
""We are not out of the woods and this crisis is not over,"" he said.
As of Thursday, Fairfield had 335 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, 38 of which resulted in the death of a town resident, according to Health Department Director Sands Cleary, who said at the news conference that the virus could peak as late as the end of May.
Kupchick announced at the news conference that the town Memorial Day parade had been canceled.
""We simply felt it would put too many of our residents at risk,"" she said."

Real estate and sewer taxes originally due May 1 will now be accepted until July 1. Additionally, taxes for real estate, vehicles and personal property previously due Aug. 1 can now be paid as late as Oct. 1. The changes were approved last week by Fairfield's Representative Town Meeting.
""For the benefit of the taxpayer, it really goes a long way,"" Caitlin Bosse, interim chief finance officer, told the town meeting during an April 13 meeting held via teleconference. ""… Our taxpayers are looking for a deferment.""
The new coronavirus has transformed day-to-day life in Fairfield and across Connecticut. Many businesses have been forced to close or limit services as the virus's death toll has risen above 1,000 people statewide. According to the most recent available data, Fairfield has had 261 confirmed cases and 26 town residents have died after getting the virus.
The Fairfield tax collector's office had been receiving about 20 phone calls per day seeking a deferment, according to town documents. The deferment will hold up as much as $20 million in government revenue, the documents said, adding Fairfield is financially equipped to handle the delay. The town projected a roughly $27,000 investment loss from the deferment, but Bosse told the town meeting that more residents than predicted had paid their taxes before the original May 1 deadline, meaning the loss will be lower than anticipated.
The deferment received a yes vote from every town meeting member on the April 13 call and is part of an order from Gov. Ned Lamont requiring municipalities to support taxpayers by either passing a deferment or temporarily lowering the interest rate on taxes to 3 percent.
The changes approved by the town meeting apply to all taxpayers, including businesses, with the exception of real estate accounts that are in escrow and paid by a bank. Landlords must apply to qualify for deferment eligibility.
Before passing the deferment, town meeting members discussed how the new coronavirus has affected government services and spending in Fairfield. Meeting member Hannah Gale, D-6, asking if residents would be repaid for education services that are not being offered while students are learning from home due to the virus. Minority Leader Pam Iacono, R-8, expressed similar concerns in reference to the closure of town recreation areas and libraries.
""We aren't getting services that we paid for,"" she said. ""… What's the return here?""
Members Dru Mercer Georgiadis, D-9, and Sharon Pistilli, D-3, noted that while school buildings are closed, the district is still serving students. Majority Leader Jill Vergara, D-District 7, stressed the need for the town to save money, suggesting Fairfield might hold off on hiring a new public works director after former director Joe Michelangelo was fired last year.
First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick responded that she had furloughed more than 100 part-time town employees, but that any restructuring of town operations won't happen until a budget is passed later in the spring.
""We are very, very cognizant of what's going on with the financial situation,"" she said."

No question these are unprecedented times and no doubt, an opportunity to come together as a town and a community to help others, to be supportive and kind. These values have been displayed since day one of the crisis — from our elected leaders and first responders to business owners who are donating to other businesses who are feeling the financial pain of COVID-19, to ordinary citizens helping our most vulnerable citizens.
Several weeks ago, as our new norms became social distancing, home-schooling our children and helping to ""flatten the curve,"" I called on our counterparts from the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee to halt campaigning and political operations, and to take a moment to put our differences aside and to put Fairfield first. On the Republican side, we've been adhering to that ideal and have put our efforts to helping others during this time of economic uncertainty and major public health concerns.
However, in contrast, our counterparts on the Democratic Town Committee threw an unfair and inaccurate barb at the Fairfield Republican Town Committee's vice chairman, Alex Plitsas, for a tweet he published about the upcoming presidential race. Alex is a husband and a father, and has served our country with tremendous honor, and calling him a racist was unjust and does not represent Alex as an individual or his values. Campaigning and taking opportunities to score political points should not be a priority right now. Being good neighbors and citizens should be our main mission.
Once again, I call on our Democratic counterparts to put politics aside and to come together as a community. Factions and rhetoric are not going to solve the immense challenges before us and as a unified town, we can do more together.
Thank you,

Fairfield Republican Town Committee Vice Chair Alex Plitsas on Wednesday morning retweeted a post from CNBC that linked to an article about Sen. Elizabeth Warren endorsing former vice president Joe Biden in his bid for the White House. Above the CNBC tweet, Plitsas wrote, ""The Last of the Mohicans.""
The tweet references the title of an 1826 historical novel that has been repeatedly adapted for television and film, as well as Warren's past claims of Native American ancestry, which have been a source of controversy throughout her political career.
Fairfield Democratic Town Committee Chairman Steve Sheinberg said in a prepared statement that the committee was ""extremely disappointed and saddened"" by the tweet.
""Civil political discourse has no room for name-calling that mocks Native American identity,"" Sheinberg said in the statement. ""I sincerely hope that Vice Chair Plitsas retracts and apologizes for his tweet.""
Plitsas, who is a member of Fairfield's Emergency Management Team and the director of the Republican veteran engagement program CT GOP Vets, said he would not delete the tweet and speculated that Sheinberg's statements were politically motivated. He also denied the tweet was racist, and said it was meant to be a joke.
""She's not actually Native American so it's kind of hard to be racist,"" he said.
Prior to holding elected office, Warren claimed to be of Native American descent throughout her career in academia, an assertion that came under scrutiny in 2012 when she ran for the Senate. In 2018, Warren took a DNA test, which revealed she likely had a Native American ancestor dating back six to ten generations, although some Native American leaders criticized the DNA test on the grounds that having Native American DNA is not equivalent to having a Native American identity.
""Warren falsely claimed Native American heritage for her own benefit,"" Plitsas said. ""If anyone should be offended by anything, that's it."""

Gov. Ned Lamont was absolutely right in rejecting last Friday's request to use his emergency powers to allow the tribal owners of Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun to offer online gambling while they are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
First, this was an attempted power play by the tribes to use the pandemic to bypass the legislature not only to gain approval for online gambling but to gain the exclusive right to offer it in Connecticut.
And second, this is exactly the wrong time to put a virtual casino in every sheltering home in the state. According to gambling addiction professionals, the rate of problem gambling disorders, and the resulting social and personal financial problems, increases for online players, including especially those experiencing isolation, loneliness and depression. Already, we would point out, internet gambling addiction is the fastest growing addiction among American kids, high schoolers and college students because of real-time betting access on cell phones and computers.
We believe Gov. Lamont spoke for a majority of Connecticut citizens in saying: ""Authorizing online gaming and enabling consumers to more easily access gambling is a significant policy decision that has not been embraced or acted upon by our legislature. Doing so at a time when so many Connecticut residents are in financial distress would be a particularly significant policy decision to make without legislative approval.""
Even in the best and most stable of financial times, introducing a way for citizens to gamble from anywhere at any hour of the day poses significant addiction risks. Online gambling is a big public policy change, deserving of a proper legislative process and careful consideration.

We are living through an unprecedented time in American history. Old wounds that were ignored and swept under the rug for generations have once again come to light and hundreds of thousands of Americans from all walks of life have hit the streets demanding we face these wounds and rectify them once and for all.
We've even seen multiple protests right here in Fairfield. I was pleased at first to see the first selectwoman announce that there would be a public discussion on race inequality and policing with municipal and state leadership and the police department via video conference, but I was very disappointed to see this ended up being nothing more than local leadership congratulating themselves on having a black friend in high school. The general public was barely given any time to ask questions or give comments, which is funny because if you ask me it should be the public talking most and those in charge should be listening more. The questions people asked were tough but are ones we need to be asking. Others mentioned that this discussion had already been going on with social justice groups in town and the first selectwoman had even attended some of them herself. Others brought up the first selectwoman's admiration for Ronald Reagan as problematic because of Reagan's domestic and foreign policies overwhelmingly harming communities of color in the United States and in Latin America, which really seemed to anger the first selectwoman. Let's be honest here, saying Ronald Reagan was racist is like saying the Atlantic Ocean is a little bit wet. He referred to UN diplomats from Tanzania as ""monkeys"" on a phone call with then-President Richard Nixon, when he was governor of California he said people had the right to discriminate against black people wanting to buy or rent a home, he called black single mothers ""welfare queens,"" and vetoed a bill that would have sanctioned South Africa for Apartheid.
This refusal to listen let alone self-reflect is part of the problem today when it comes to racial inequity. We did not want to face the horrors of our nation's past so instead we changed the narrative and hoped it would just be forgotten. Instead, that dark past metastasized into the ugly cancer we see before us today.
I hope the first selectwoman does another public discussion on this topic, but maybe next time the public will get to comment more and those in leadership will listen more.

First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick and Chief of Police Christopher Lyddy have agreed to sign Commit To Action, pledging to review use of force policies in Fairfield, include a diverse range of input during the review process, report the review findings, and reform the policies, Kupchick said Monday at a Board of Selectmen meeting.
The move comes after town officials faced criticism and scrutiny at a forum last week on race and law enforcement, held following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, a tragedy that sparked protests across the country and in Fairfield.
""Our existing policy already addresses many of the concerns that we're hearing throughout the nation,"" Lyddy said.
The Fairfield policy, which was last reviewed in 2017, will likely change after the state last week introduced a new model policy, according to Lyddy. Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Monday to reform state police, banning chokeholds, mandating intervention and written reports for excessive force, and requiring the creation of a public portal with town-specific data on when force is used by police.
Fairfield's policy already prohibits chokeholds, Lyddy said. It also bans excessive physical force against non-violent demonstrators and prioritizes deescalation, according to the policy document, provided by Lyddy.
The policy does allow deadly force to be used in defense against existing or imminent deadly force or great bodily harm, the document said. If an officer shoots a gun, they must immediately notify the 911 call center or the ranking supervisor, depending on the severity of the incident. Additionally, criminal and professional investigations must be conducted. Should use of force result in death or serious injury, the chief will remove the officer from a front-line assignment, pending administrative review.
In addition to revisiting the use of force policy, Fairfield is starting an Equality and Justice Task Force. Lyddy is also working to answer the many questions he received from residents about town law enforcement at the recent forum, according to Selectwoman Nancy Lefkowitz, who has been appointed co-chair of the task force."

The event, referred to in a flyer circulating on social media as a ""Unity Through Diversity Peaceful Protest And March,"" comes after weeks of demonstrations — including two in Fairfield — following the death of Minnesota man George Floyd in police custody. Fired Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, seen in a viral video with his knee on Floyd's neck, is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other former officers are also charged in connection with the death.
Sunday's protest will begin noon at Clinton Park at the corner of North and Brooklawn avenues, according to the flyer, which was posted on Twitter by the event's organizer, the multicultural Sacred Heart fraternity Omega Phi Kappa. Demonstrators are asked to dress in black and wear a face mask to prevent transmission of the coronavirus.
Another Twitter account called BLM — Say Their Names posted a map of the roughly 4-mile march route, which goes down Clinton Avenue, turns onto Fairfield Avenue, turns again and crosses into Fairfield on Brewster Street in the area where it becomes Black Rock Turnpike, and then goes up Kings Highway East and circles back to the park."

""The intent for me is to allow the public to have the opportunity, as many people as possible, to speak,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said as the event began.
Much of the forum, held remotely via Webex, was dedicated to remarks from a panel of elected representatives and police officials. Several members of the public also spoke. Their questions were not addressed directly by the panel, but were discussed by fellow community members in Webex's chat function.
""Does our local police department really need firearms?"" resident Jason Racheotes asked, while in the midst of presenting a long list of questions to the panel, including inquiries about how town law enforcement is penalized and funded.
Earlier in the forum, Capt. Robert Kalamaras said a review of Fairfield's training records and policies show the department is ""doing most things right,"" although room remains for improvement.
""Our nation's law enforcement system has fallen way to tyranny,"" said Representative Town Meeting member Tameisha Powell-Dunmore, D-District 6, later adding police and communities must come together.
Chief Christopher Lyddy said his approach to the present public concern was to ""shut up for a while and listen.""
""One common message, broad message, that I've received is that people of color do not feel comfortable walking down our streets in our predominantly white community,"" Lyddy said. ""… I'm deeply concerned about the weaponization of police in our community.""
The department will not respond to calls for service that are based solely on the color of a person's skin, he said.
In discussing the need for body cameras and independent investigation of complaints against law enforcement, state Rep. Brian Farnen, R-District 132, referred to ""a few bad apples"" in policing, a phrase with which community member Molly Baker took issue.
""It is not just a few bad apples,"" she said, calling for prison abolition and defunding of law enforcement. ""… Training needs to change drastically in all police departments.""
Other ideas suggested by community members included regionalizing area public schools to create a more equitable distribution of resources, increasing affordable housing and allocating more money for social workers.
Resident Hannah Kayumba said social justice organization Fairfield Yabantu asked for town police to receive training on diversity, but it hasn't happened.
""A lot of you just came on here to do lip service,"" she said.
As the forum drew to a close, Kupchick said some of the community's comments about Fairfield police were unfair and that defunding law enforcement was inappropriate.
""Frankly, I'm a little disappointed in the partisanship that I heard,"" Kupchick, a Republican, said.
State Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D–District 133, called for Fairfield to elevate the voices of people of color.
""We as people with power and authority have a particular duty to listen, to hear, to feel,"" she said.
Farnen asked Fairfielders to, ""talk to each other, not at each other.""
Many who attended the forum took issue in the Webex chat with how the event was run. Town meeting Majority Leader Jill Vergara, D-District 7, was unhappy that more town meeting members and school board members weren't invited to participate. Others expressed disappointment that the panel was not more diverse.
In addition to Kupchick, Kalamaras, Powell-Dunmore, Lyddy, Farnen and McCarthy Vahey, panelists included Republican Selectman Tom Flynn; Democrat Selectwoman Nancy Lefkowitz; state Sen. Tony Hwang, R-District 28; and state Rep. Laura Devlin, R-District 134.

The legal complaint, dated May 28, accuses Osprey Environmental Engineering LLC and its president, Robert J. Grabarek, of 13 counts, including negligence, breach of contract and ultra-hazardous activities. Fairfield is seeking thousands in damages and has requested a jury trial.
""(The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection) never signed off on any of the stuff that they advised the town to do,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said.
Fairfield hired Osprey in 2016 to manage the closure plan for a solid waste disposal area under the pile — left over from when the site was used as a landfill — and supervise construction of a berm around the pile, according to the complaint. Osprey told the town that the solid waste area could be closed by moving soil from the area — known to contain PCBs and other hazardous material — and burying it in the berm without state approval, the complaint said.
In April 2018, Osprey directed the town to start construction of the berm, despite not having approval from the state, according to the complaint. In addition to PCBs, the soil the company told Fairfield to use in the berm contained lead, arsenic and mercury at concentrations above cleanup standards, the complaint said. Town workers finished the berm in June 2018.
Osprey did not respond to a call Tuesday seeking comment.
More than a year after the berm was completed, the state issued Fairfield a notice of violation, citing PCB contamination up to 9.6 parts per million in soil at the pile. The notice said the contamination had resulted in unauthorized pollution of state water, according to the complaint.
In early 2020, the town received a second state violation notice, this time saying that a 2019 state inspection at the pile revealed the town disrupted a solid waste disposal area without written approval. Fairfield also got a notice of violation about PCBs at the pile from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The town has since hired contractors to execute a compliant plan to close the area.
The state in May approved a testing and remediation plan from new Fairfield contractor Weston & Sampson Inc., which was set to start testing the site this week, according to Kupchick. Town officials recently transferred $400,000 to cover the costs of fill pile testing. The money is part of the $1.8 million allocated by the Board of Finance for pile-related expenses.
""I'm looking forward to the beginning of this process to start the work of cleaning up this contamination,"" Kupchick said.
Approval from the state is pending for remediation of seven additional sites that are categorized as solid waste facilities after they received material from the fill pile. The sites include: the Jennings Elementary School playground, McKinley Elementary School, Osborn Hill Elementary School, Mill Hill Elementary School, Sunset Avenue, Old Dam Road and Southport Beach.
The fill pile is connected to charges brought last summer against two town employees and the owner of contractor Julian Companies, all of whom are accused of participating in a conspiracy to illegally operate a dump for contaminated material at the pile and to allow fraudulent billing. A former town employee was charged several months after the initial arrests with stealing a file related to the fill pile case.
Around the same time the first three defendants were charged, asbestos at a local park was reported to police in connection with the use of town fill. Since August, more than 80 areas in Fairfield have been tested for contamination, with the vast majority deemed safe but others undergoing necessary remediation."

28,/connecticut/fairfield/protest-closes-post-road-downtown-fairfield,2020-06-02T17:19:50Z,Fairfield Protest: Demonstrators Block Post Road,4,53,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — When Emma Powell posted on Instagram three days ago that she was planning to peacefully sit in at Sherman Green to protest police brutality against people of color, she didn't expect her invitation for others to join would draw roughly 250 people, close roads and inspire a march to Old Town Hall.
""It was the most beautiful thing I think I've ever seen,"" said Powell, a 19-year-old Fairfield Ludlowe High School graduate. ""… People spontaneously took to the streets.""
The protest came after a week of demonstrations following the death of Minnesota man George Floyd. Fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, seen in a viral video with his knee on Floyd's neck, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder. Floyd's death sparked protests nationwide, some of which have been accompanied by acts of violence.
""We're witnessing a genocide of our people,"" said one Fairfield protester, a Stratford resident who asked only to be identified as ""C."" ""… 'Black lives matter' should not be a controversial statement.""
The event Tuesday in Fairfield was peaceful. The demonstrators, wearing mostly black, filled Sherman Green about 11:30 a.m., lying across Post Road to block traffic and making an impromptu 3-mile march downtown, through the beach area and up to Old Town Hall, where they formed a speaking circle, Powell said.
""We figure any chance we get to come and protest against police brutality is a chance that we should take up,"" said Samantha Sainvil, of Bridgeport, who also attended protests in Waterbury and Stratford.
The Fairfield event, set to end at 6 p.m., was still going strong mid-afternoon, with demonstrators returning to Sherman Green and lining Post Road, waving signs with messages such as, ""I can't breathe,"" and ""Black lives matter,"" and chanting, ""Silence is compliance,"" to the honks of passing cars.
""It's not enough to be not racist,"" said John Whaley, who is the facilitator of Voices for Equity at Fairfield Warde High School and helped spread the word about the protest on social media.
The majority of the protesters wore face masks as a precaution against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick joined the demonstrators, first at Sherman Green before the event began, and later when the protesters made their way to Old Town Hall.
""I was proud of our residents for coming together in a peaceful way to speak out against hatred and violence,"" she said.
Kupchick also praised Fairfield police for their professionalism keeping protesters and the public safe when the group blocked town roads.
""We are lucky in our community that people can join together to express a common purpose,"" Fairfield police Capt. Robert Kalamaras said in an email. ""From my understanding this protest was organized by a younger generation from Fairfield that is looking for positive change, and members of the Fairfield Police Department will support that."""
29,/connecticut/fairfield/no-tax-rate-increase-fairfield-after-rtm-cuts-budget-1-1m,2020-06-02T07:50:50Z,No Tax Rate Increase For Fairfield,0,7,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — Fairfield's tax rate will not increase, after the Representative Town Meeting unanimously approved a budget Monday that included more than $1 million in cuts.
The town's final budget for 2021 came in at $317.2 million, a less than $1 million increase year-over-year. Before Monday's reductions, the proposed budget was $318.3 million, a number the Board of Finance approved after cutting $9.1 million in May. In recent weeks, town officials have had to adjust the budget, written before the coronavirus pandemic, to account for the virus' economic impact.
""This has been an extraordinarily difficult first six months,"" said First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick, who took office in November, at the end of Monday's meeting, held via teleconference. ""… I am proud that we were able to deliver a zero percent tax increase.""
Among the cuts approved by the town meeting were about $925,000 in bus contract and vehicle fuel savings.
""These proposed reductions that I'm now offering represent a bipartisan package,"" said Majority Leader Jill Vergara, D-District 7, as she introduced the cuts, which passed unanimously.
Minority Leader Pamela Iacono, R-District 8, concurred.
""We've had a very good dialogue in working towards the betterment of Fairfield,"" she said.
However, when Iacono proposed eliminating the vacant public works positions of foreman and maintenance repairman in order to save roughly $192,000, she faced some resistance, with the motion passing 30-10. Kupchick said the jobs could be removed without cuts to service.
With the budget finalized, the Board of Finance is expected to meet Thursday to set the mill rate.
Much of the conversation Monday was on the one proposed cut that didn't see a vote. Town meeting member Marcy Spolyar, D-District 4, sought a discussion of whether to cut $55,000 in pay and benefits from the position of chief administrative officer, but later rescinded the motion.
Spolyar said the role was redundant and not worth the $120,000 salary that Chief Administrative Officer Tom Bremer is paid. Funding for the position was approved in December after a heated and lengthy special meeting of the Board of Finance.
""I just feel that at this time of COVID, we can't afford this,"" Spolyar said.
Kupchick argued that the chief administrative officer, who sometimes serves as a surrogate for the first selectwoman, is necessary because much of Kupchick's time is taken up by the aftermath of the fill pile corruption scandal that dominated town meetings and headlines for months in 2019. She also defended Bremer's salary.
""In the real world you need to hire for talent,"" she said. ""… I need a qualified, well-paid person to assist me.""
Many other town meeting members weighed in on the issue. Alex Durrell, R-District 3, said the position was a good long-term investment for the town's economy. Matt Jacobs, D-District 3, called Bremer's salary ""egregious."" Karen McCormack, R-District 2, said the pandemic had hindered Kupchick's ability to showcase the benefits of the position.
Julie Gottlieb, D-District 5, opposed a financial cut to the job, citing the complications caused by the coronavirus, but had a word of caution for Kupchick.
""I do expect to see very clear ROI and delivery on the promises that were made in December,"" she said."

Fairfield set up the COVID-19 Small Business Assistance Program to provide direct financial assistance to eligible businesses with five or fewer employees.
""Small businesses are integral to the success of this community and it's been a very challenging few months,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said in the news release. ""It's very important that we do all that we can to help our small business community navigate these uncertain times, and provide resources and support they need to enable businesses to safely re-open and return to profitability.""
To be eligible, applicants must be a for-profit business physically located in Fairfield. The business must have been in operation and current on its federal, state and local tax obligations as of March 15 and must not have received, or been approved to receive, federal or state assistance for coronavirus relief.
Priority will be given to businesses that are owned by or have a majority of employees classified as people of low or moderate income. Income guidelines may be viewed at bit.ly/2Adr23e.
The program is being funded through a grant from the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development, and administered by the town's Department of Community & Economic Development.
Eligible businesses may apply for grants of up to $5,000. Funding is limited, and it is anticipated that average grants will range from $2,000 to $3,000. Applications will be accepted and grants awarded on a rolling basis until funds are exhausted.
Fairfield small businesses are encouraged to visit fairfieldct.org/covidSBR to download and submit an application. A subcommittee of the Fairfield Economic Development Commission will review all applications received.
""We know that these past few months have been extremely challenging for many small businesses, and that a number of these businesses have been unable to access meaningfully any federal or state assistance programs,"" Community & Economic Development Director Mark Barnhart said in the news release. ""We hope that this program will help fill those gaps, and provide assistance to those small businesses most in need so that they can respond to this pandemic.""

31,/connecticut/fairfield/5-story-apartment-building-approved-downtown-fairfield-site,2020-06-24T08:33:17Z,5-Story Apartment Building Approved,0,17,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — A five-story apartment building may soon be part of the landscape in downtown Fairfield, after zoning officials approved the development Tuesday, despite concerns about its effect on parking.
The Town Plan and Zoning Commission signed off on the application to build 26 apartments — eight of which will qualify as affordable housing — at 78 Unquowa Place. Commissioner Kathryn Braun cast the lone dissenting vote, and said the project could create a ""parking nightmare."" Braun wasn't the only commissioner worried about parking.
""I do have concerns with the location and the tightness of the parking,"" Commissioner Lenny Braman said during Tuesday's meeting, held via teleconference.
The development, called Fairfield Station Lofts, will include 27 parking spots, with one for each apartment in a first-floor parking structure and another for delivery and loading between the building and the street. Police comments on the proposal focused on the lack of parking, while the fire department requested the developer seek to pay to move utility lines on the property underground. The fire department's ask was acknowledged as one of several conditions of approval included in the commission's vote.
""These are aspirational, if you will, given the nature of the application under 8-30g,"" Chair Matthew Wagner said of the conditions, referencing state law Section 8-30g.
The law dictates the only way the commission could have denied the proposal was by proving it posed a threat to public health, welfare and safety that outweighed Fairfield's need for affordable housing. Section 8-30g applies to towns where less than 10 percent of housing stock meets state criteria to be recognized as affordable.
Fairfield Station Lofts will be a more than 31,000-square-foot, roughly 65-foot building on a 0.32-acre triangular lot, currently occupied by a single-family home built in 1884. The site neighbors the train tracks and downtown station, as well as a pediatric health center.
The units in the development will range from one bedroom to three bedrooms, and will vary in size from about 800 square feet to about 2,200 square feet. Four apartments will be designated for people earning less than 60 percent of the statewide median income and four will be for those earning less than 80 percent of the statewide median income. The building is intended to attract young adults, empty nesters and commuters.
""I think this is a great location for this,"" Vice Chair Mark Corcoran said.
Corcoran added he was particularly happy about the six three-bedroom apartments the building would bring to town, although he did acknowledge the parking issue."
32,/connecticut/fairfield/state-rep-devlin-calls-juneteenth-become-state-holiday,2020-06-22T22:28:52Z,Juneteenth State Holiday ,0,7,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — State Rep. Laura Devlin, R-District 134, is calling on the state to pass legislation making Juneteenth Independence Day — a day that commemorates African American freedom with the end of slavery in the U.S. — an official holiday in the state. She will propose a bill next session if the matter is not taken up in the special session, according to a news release from the Connecticut House Republicans.
Juneteenth, which is also called Emancipation Day and Freedom Day, is celebrated annually on June 19. Texas first made it a state holiday in 1980.
""Connecticut should rightly formally celebrate and commemorate Juneteenth as an official state holiday, being the day where freedom for all started,"" Devlin said in the news release. ""There is no place for injustice, bigotry or racism in our society. Establishing this holiday will hopefully promote a greater education on recognizing the struggles of African Americans and the evils of slavery and will further affirm that Connecticut is a place that embraces tolerance and acceptance of all people.""
In 2003, the Connecticut General Statutes included the Saturday that is closest to June 19 of each year to be proclaimed Juneteenth Independence Day by the governor, with exercises held in the state Capitol and elsewhere as the governor designates for the observance of the day.
Juneteenth, a combination of the month's name and the date, commemorates June 19, 1865, when news finally reached African Americans in Texas that President Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves living in Confederate states two years earlier. When Union soldiers arrived in Galveston to bring the news that slavery had been abolished, former slaves celebrated."

Prominent Republican leaders have called for the head of their party, Chair J.R. Romano, to resign after he declined to view the 2017 video of 2nd Congressional District candidate Thomas Gilmer, which was offered to him by Gilmer's opponent, Justin Anderson, before Gilmer secured the party's nomination, according to the Connecticut Mirror. Gilmer lost to Anderson in last week's primary after a recount.
""Almost a week has passed since this story came to light, and yet silence from the Fairfield RTC and all of Fairfield's elected Republican officials. What are they waiting for?"" the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee said Monday in a Facebook post.
Republican Town Committee Chair Jack Testani fired back Tuesday with a prepared statement.
""The Fairfield Republican Town Committee joins many other Republican leaders from around the State in expressing our concerns about reports of domestic violence by a candidate for U.S. Congress in the 2nd District,"" Testani said. ""We are incensed that the victim of this incident was allowed to be used as a political tactic and we are confident the justice system will prevail. Domestic violence is never acceptable no matter who perpetrated the crime and there are never mitigating circumstances to justify it.""
Testani also said his committee would make a donation to a local charity for domestic abuse victims, before pivoting to directly target Democratic committee Chair Steve Sheinberg. Testani accused Sheinberg of politicizing domestic violence and said Sheinberg failed to speak out after Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty ignored allegations of domestic violence and sexual harassment against her chief of staff.
""The failure to address domestic violence consistently makes it clear that Mr. Sheinberg is seeking to use this situation for political gain based on the perpetrator's political affiliation,"" Testani said. ""Mr. Sheinberg can now add victims of domestic violence to a list of people that he is willing to exploit in an attempt to win an election.""
Testani also said Sheinberg ""failed to take a stand"" at a protest last month when demonstrators ""hurled vulgarities"" at local elected officials. In addition, Testani mentioned Sheinberg's support for former first selectman Mike Tetreau in the wake of a public corruption scandal involving illegal dumping at the town fill pile, which came to light at the end of Tetreau's time in office.
""They are clearly trying to deflect from the fact that they and all of their Republican elected officials remained silent for a week on this,"" Sheinberg responded in an email. ""He is only speaking up now because they got called out. And, in fact, he still does not call out Romano for any wrongdoing in protecting and moving forward with a candidate who was credibly accused of domestic abuse, but instead blames the guy who came forward with the evidence!""
Anderson gave the video to law enforcement, and Wethersfield police charged Gilmer last week with first-degree unlawful restraint and second-degree strangulation, the Mirror reported, noting that news of the arrest broke as voters were at the polls. After a recount, Anderson was declared the winner, although some have said his attempt to use the video to keep Gilmer from running should disqualify him, according to the Mirror."

The first event will take place noon to 1 p.m. Friday at the Sherman Green (near the gazebo). All are welcome. Face masks are required, and people are encouraged to bring a cup of coffee. Romano-Csonka will discuss issues including the 8-30g affordable housing law and affordable housing reform, education, the need for balanced leadership in Hartford and more.

I was delighted to hear that as a child you were raised here and marched in the Memorial Day Parade. This indicated to me that deep down you have a love for this town that began many decades ago.
In the interest of being neighbors and one who loves the history of our town, I implore you to please consider working with the neighborhood to reach a mutually agreed upon size for your development at 131 Beach Road.

I support police officers, and as a municipal lawyer fully recognize the dangers inherent in their job. They have my utmost respect. I actually read the police reform bill recently passed by the Connecticut Legislature and feel compelled to respond to the mischaracterization by Fairfield First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick in her recent op-ed that the bill contains language ""ending qualified immunity,"" leading one to believe that police officers are now on their own without receiving any protections from civil liability if they are sued. This is simply untrue and implying otherwise is irresponsible.
Qualified immunity is a legal doctrine that rightfully protects police officers from civil liability when they need to make split-second decisions (sometimes when exercising deadly force) in performing their duties. Generally, an officer is judged on an ""objectively reasonable"" standard, namely how an officer would act based on his/her training under similar facts and circumstances confronting them, and if the action was deemed reasonable then the officer is shielded from liability.
Contrary to Ms. Kupchick's statement, the bill does not end qualified immunity. In fact, it incorporates many of its concepts (see Section 53a-22). As the Connecticut Post reported (July 29, 2020), one intent of the law is to bring the justifiable use of deadly force standard in line with federal law, which implicitly includes the doctrine of qualified immunity. The bill further requires municipalities to indemnify and hold harmless police officers who get sued, providing further protections for the police, so long as their conduct is not determined to be malicious, willful, or wanton. This is nothing new and is the current state of the law.
To be clear, I would be the first to object if I believed that the new law negatively impacted the rightful protection that officers receive under the doctrine of qualified immunity.
Ms. Kupchick's statement that the bill ends qualified immunity is incorrect and makes me wonder if she even read the bill. The issue of police reform is a hot-button issue rife with emotions on both sides, and our elected officials need to act responsibly, putting the best interests of the town ahead of political posturing.
I would suggest to our first selectwoman that instead of calling press conferences to score political points and issuing press releases that spread misinformation, she should use more discretion, exercise better judgement and better educate herself on the issue confronting her. This is especially true regarding issues as sensitive as police reform. That is what most Fairfielders want from their first selectperson.

Fairfield's registrar of voters has issued a news release to prepare voters for Tuesday's visit to the polls.
All ten districts will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday. Due to construction, Sherman Elementary School voters should report to the Senior Center, 100 Mona Terrace, to vote. All other voters will go to their usual polling places.
Local officials have taken steps to ensure safe voting at the polls with 6-foot distancing; masks and hand sanitizer available for voters who need them; disinfecting booths between voters; single-use pens; and safety shields at all stations.
Officials are also promoting the availability of touchless curbside voting. Voters who are concerned about the health risks of voting indoors can park at the yellow signs at each polling place (or visit workers at the canopy tent) to have a ballot brought to them.
Voters are asked to wear a mask inside the polling place. Those with a medical issue that prevents mask use will be served at the curbside station.
Nearly 7,000 voters have requested absentee ballots, and due to delays from the state vendor and delivery issues around Hurricane Isaias, many residents have reported receiving their absentee ballots late.
For voters concerned about returning their ballot on time, a secure drop box is available at Old Town Hall, 611 Old Post Road. Any ballot received by mail or in the drop box by 8 p.m. Tuesday will be counted.
Voters who haven't received their ballot should come to their polling place Tuesday to vote.

Fairfield Republican Party Chairman Jack Testani's published statement against Democratic Party Chairman Steve Sheinberg was nonsensical. A party chairperson is, by definition, political, but some restraint should be shown for the public good. I do not know him, so I cannot say it was beneath him, but I do feel it is beneath the position he holds. Mr. Testani, as RTC chairman, issued a statement that Mr. Sheinberg should have personally intervened to ""address the behavior"" of protestors using inappropriate language during last Monday's joint Police-Republican rally to reject HB 6004. Apparently, he feels this was Mr. Sheinberg's duty regardless of whether the DTC chairman knew those individuals or not. Mr. Testanti's statement was accompanied by an innocuous photo of Mr. Sheinberg standing attentively, apart from protesters, arms crossed, listening to press conference speakers. I was there too, for much of the time, standing next to Republicans who, like Mr. Sheinberg, were listening and chatting intermittently. Ironically, during the rally I had a chance to talk with Chairman Sheinberg, who told me he was dismayed by a few of the slogans and that he disagreed with chants to ""defund the police."" However, he was acutely aware of the counter-protesters' First Amendment rights. Fairfield has always had a large percentage of moderates who lean to one side or the other depending on the issue, resulting in a common sense approach to government most of the time. Republican Chairman Testani's statement looks like an attempt to employ Donald Trump's national strategy — to manufacture divisions where they have not existed — in order to motivate the Republican base before November. An honest assessment reveals the opposite of Mr. Testani's attempted narrative. Fairfielders can read online meeting minutes going back 10 years to see that Fairfield's Democrats have, by far, more consistently and unanimously supported the Fairfield police (employee contracts, operating budgets and defined benefit pension plans) than Republicans have. Under Chairman Sheinberg's leadership (and that of past DTC chairs) this financial support (actual dollars committed to support the lives and working conditions of Fairfield police) has been unwavering. I have been proud to be part of this effort, so I find Mr. Testani's attempted message particularly insincere and offensive. I hope Fairfielders reject Mr. Testani's false message and see through his methods.

First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick took a page from Donald Trump's ugly campaign strategy last Monday. Presidents should never politicize the military the public has entrusted to report into them, nor should municipal heads politicize their police force. Public trust in the impartiality of these institutions is a cornerstone of democracy requiring restraint on the part of political leaders. Restraint rests on norms that, in turn, rely on core beliefs and character. Temptations for abuse are great and ever-present. There's no need to refer to history books for examples of how whittling away at this balance clears a path for autocracy; just read the newspaper. George Floyd's death accelerated a clearing of the cobwebs for a majority of good people in America who are now grappling with the knowledge that treasured police impartiality is severely lacking for many minorities. This makes Mrs. Kupchick's decision to hold her joint police department and Republican candidate rally, on the steps of PD headquarters, advocating for rejection of police accountability act HB 6004, so upsetting.
America's Republican-led federal government has largely abandoned restraint. This letter could easily become a laundry list of examples, but one that comes to mind readily is Trump's use of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley — dressed in fatigues — to legitimize the violent clearing of peaceful protesters for Trump's walk to St. John's Church for his misguided photo-opp. Understanding the gravity of his mistake, Gen. Milley later apologized for allowing himself and the U.S. military to be politicized. Another example is Trump's sending of federal forces to instigate clashes with protesters in cities, without consent of state governments, to bolster his ""law and order"" narrative—a law and order narrative, I might add, that curiously allowed armed protesters to storm Michigan's state Capitol without the same treatment.
HB 6004 is complex. There are legitimate arguments on all sides of each component, with opinions heavily influenced by life experience, perspective, race, and other factors. Mrs. Kupchick had options for forums to allow Police Chief Lyddy to communicate police department concerns without tarnishing perception of its impartiality. A Webex conference could have been a productive medium for him to detail each point without interruption, field questions, and cut off vulgar or inappropriate comments. Instead, our Republican first selectwoman chose, a few months from Election Day, to use our police headquarters and our outstanding men and women in blue to appear (to many) as props in a reelection rally for Republican state Reps. Brian Farnen and Laura Devlin, and to bolster the state Republican Party narrative. None of their rally speeches added meaningfully to the words spoken by Chief Lyddy.
Where was the restraint from leadership we expect to preserve public trust in impartial policing? Where was the concern for the public good? The good that could have made this a police-led forum, one that facilitated education, potentially opened Fairfielders up to seeing (or at least acknowledging) another side, and thereby could have been a step towards unity instead of the division we are drowning in?
That leadership was absent. Brenda Kupchick should be ashamed of her actions. Our police are not her props. Our PD HQ is not her stage. Fairfield Republicans needn't follow the Trump playbook to be successful in Fairfield, but the temptation appears too great for them. Fairfielders, made aware of such divisive tactics, must demand the preservation of impartiality of our important institutions.

42,/connecticut/fairfield/fairfield-gop-decries-town-dems-after-protest-halted-police-event,2020-08-01T07:14:04Z,Fairfield GOP Decries Town Dems After Protest...,0,18,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — The head of Fairfield's Republican committee is criticizing town Democrats following a news conference that was called by local law enforcement about a police reform bill, but was cut short by protesters.
""The political nature of the protest became obvious when protestors got intentionally louder in an attempt to drown out the Republican State Representatives Laura Devlin and Brian Farnen, who were present to share their concerns about the legislation and the process it had followed,"" Republican Town Committee Chairman Jack Testani said Thursday in a news release.
The event Monday outside the Fairfield police station was held so officials could express their apprehensions about House Bill 6004, which was introduced in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody, and, as of Tuesday, had passed in both the state House and Senate. Among a long list of scheduled speakers Monday in Fairfield were First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick and Chief of Police Christopher Lyddy, as well as Devlin and Farnen.
Prior to the news conference, about 50 people gathered outside the station, many of whom appeared to support the police. As the event began, the makeup of the crowd changed when a large group of demonstrators with signs approached, chanting over officials, blocking the road and bringing the news conference to a halt before half the scheduled speakers took the podium. Many demonstrators remained outside the station about an hour after the event ended.
Testani took particular issue with the protesters' use of language he characterized as profane, obscene and misogynistic. In an op-ed following the event, Kupchick said she and other speakers were ""called a shocking array of profanities and further insulted with vulgarities displayed on posters"" and that she was ""extremely disheartened by the behavior of the protesters.""
Testani noted Fairfield Democratic Town Committee Chairman Steve Sheinberg's presence at the news conference, and questioned why Sheinberg did not intervene to stop the protesters' ""verbal assault"" or make his presence known. Additionally, Testani accused Sheinberg of quickly leaving the event once he was identified.
Sheinberg responded with a prepared statement Friday in which he expressed anger about Testani's comments and referenced a photo released by the town Republicans of Sheinberg standing with his arms crossed outside the police station at Monday's event.
""As DTC chairman, I am outraged over the RTC chairman's press release, which is riddled with blatantly false information,"" Sheinberg said. ""This event was a press conference that the public was invited to attend. As a citizen of Fairfield and as DTC Chairman, I was there to listen, as were so many residents, Republicans and Democrats alike. In the picture the RTC released of me, I am clearly listening ... not protesting. When the press conference concluded, I left.
""While neither the DTC nor I organized or participated in the protest, it was also not our job to silence the protesters, who are allowed to exercise their First Amendment rights just as much as those at the podium. And while I did not personally hear profanity or vulgarity from protesters, I and the DTC have never and will never condone vulgarity at such public events from anyone.""
According to Testani, the protest was organized by the civil liberties group Fairfield Standing United, whose membership includes Democrat officials in town.
""Some of our members attended the press conference on Monday to show support for the police accountability bill HB 6004,"" the organization said in a prepared statement. ""We understand that other groups showed up as a result of social media sharing. We want to emphasize that while we stand in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, we denounce hate speech directed at law enforcement and elected officials, including any misogynistic language allegedly aimed at the female elected officials who spoke.""
The group added that a community conversation — like the one Kupchick facilitated in June after Floyd's death and the subsequent widespread protests against racism and police brutality — could have more effectively unified the town in addressing concerns about the reform bill.
""Given the backdrop of recent national events, we saw that the gathering quickly became an expression of pain and frustration arising from the lived experiences of people of color in our town and surrounding areas,"" the statement said. ""Fairfield Standing United values the First Amendment rights of all citizens and we look forward to opportunities for constructive and open dialogue with all community stakeholders in the future."""

When civil discourse is lost in the debate
""Since the murder of George Floyd, Fairfield has been host to protests and rallies. At each of these events, protesters were provided the opportunity to safely exercise their First Amendment right. There were no counter-protests or interruptions; just an engaged citizenry that attended peacefully, listened, and went home, myself among them. The Fairfield Police Department provided a safe environment for protesters by taking swift action to close down the Post Road as they spilled onto the street. While faced with signs that read ""Police are Murderers"" and other profane language, they continued to provided safe passage with the utmost professionalism.
On Monday afternoon, I held a press conference on the front steps of the Fairfield Police Department with law enforcement and other local elected officials to express concerns regarding HB 6004: An Act Concerning Police Accountability, which passed the Connecticut House of Representatives last week.
Instead of being afforded the same courtesy to exercise our First Amendment right, we were shouted down, called a shocking array of profanities and further insulted with vulgarities displayed on posters, along with a large banner with the words ""Defund and Disarm the Police"".
Let me be very clear about one thing. As the chief elected official of the town of Fairfield, I will never support defunding or disarming the Fairfield Police Department.
I unequivocally support the sections of the bill that include further training, education, mental health screenings and accountability of law enforcement. I'm extremely proud that the Fairfield Police Department already has policies in place that meets or exceeds many of those provisions outlined in the bill.
However, there is language in the bill, specifically the section ending qualified immunity, that our police chief and I believe will significantly impact the ability of our police officers to do their jobs and it will hinder Fairfield's ability to retain good cops and recruit new ones.
Additionally, there will potentially be a huge financial impact on town budgets, the extent of which is still unknown because the bill has not been fully vetted.
Undoubtedly there are policies we can put in place to hold bad actors in police departments accountable, but we should do so without punishing the majority of the good men and women who protect our community every single day.
For a bill of this magnitude with such broad implications to be rushed through a three-week process, only have one public hearing, and then be voted on in the middle of the night, is concerning and irresponsible. I hoped the Senate would table the bill until the legislature reconvened in September so all voices could be considered.
I call on the governor, who I know to be thoughtful, to hit the pause button and ensure this important legislation is reviewed completely before it is passed into law.
Emotions are high and the national political landscape makes it more difficult for all of us on a local level, but I was extremely disheartened by the behavior of the protesters who disrupted the press conference on Monday. Everyone is afforded the same protections under the First Amendment, but the only way we can truly find solutions is to participate in civil discourse, whereby conversation occurs with the intention of enhancing one's own understanding.
I call on our residents to engage in respectful and productive conversations. I appreciate and value the input from members of our community who have called me over these last few months in effort to help provide a greater understanding to me of life experiences that are different than my own.
I want to close by thanking the men and women who serve our community honorably; for their professionalism and integrity, and for putting their personal safety on the line every day to keep the residents of Fairfield safe. I thank you and many of our residents thank you.
Fairfield will get through these challenging times together.""

44,/connecticut/fairfield/letter-editor-whats-fuss-qualified-immunity,2020-07-30T05:24:04Z,Letter To The Editor: What's The Fuss About...,0,11,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"To the editor,
I'm confused.
As a teacher of rhetoric, it's confounding (and borderline spiritually debilitating) for me to witness the fervent and fallacious oppositional onslaught to House Bill 6004, an aptly titled ""act concerning police accountability."" I'm not going to attempt to debunk all the misinformation I'm reading and hearing, as state Sen. Will Haskell does so eloquently, precisely and effectively on his Instagram page.
What I am going to do is wonder aloud, if I'm being candid: What's all the fuss, especially in regards to ""qualified immunity?""
Unless you are of the ilk that champions an actual police state — and, if you are, this line of inquiry and commentary will never fit into your worldview, so you are urged to scroll away — I cannot for the life of me understand why we, moral individuals bound to our social contract, would not want laws in place that ensure humane treatment of all human beings (yes, even ones who might commit crimes) and accountability for those who abuse their power to ensure these laws are enforced.
But if this philosophical waxing is too ... philosophical, consider this hypothetical anecdote:
In this thought experiment, there is a teacher, teeming with malintent, who initiates a sexual relationship with their — not that it matters, but we'll also add — underaged student. Appalling! Surely there must be some legal recourse, not just criminally, but also in a civil court for the constitutional damages inflicted upon said victimized student, right? And, of course there is because, even though teachers have general protections under qualified immunity, if we act in ""reckless, wanton, or malicious ways,"" we must also pay the price, proverbial and actual.
Section 41 of HB 6004 designates that police officers have almost the exact same boundaries for personal liability as do teachers in our state. The language reads: ""In the event such officer has a judgment entered against him or her for a malicious, wanton or willful act in a court of law, such municipality shall be reimbursed by such officer for expenses it incurred in providing such defense and shall not be held liable to such officer for any financial loss or expense resulting from such act."" I don't know how to respond to a detractor who would debate the benefit — nay, the necessity! — of holding public servants personally accountable for ""malicious, wanton, or willful acts,"" so I won't. But what I can say is that this provision seems to, at best, only begin to scratch the litigious surface of what many #defundthepolice proponents are protesting and publishing about. This is almost, by definition, a baby step towards incremental, long-term, gradual, the-opposite-of-seismic-and-immediate change.
There's more here to discuss, and we should. But it should be just that: a discussion. Outright misinformation-saturated emotional outbursts are signposts on the road to division, disenfranchisement, and disorder. And for the swath of our community raging against the audacity of this bill's purpose (coupled with the imaginary dystopian impacts of officers not being allowed to commit, and I repeat, ""malicious, wanton, or willful acts"" without personal legal repercussions), I don't understand why anyone in allegiance to law and order would willfully misrepresent the language of this ""well-intentioned"" bill.
Teachers carry heavy emotional responsibilities to the hundreds of students they teach each year, for certain, and most people would argue that it's good and right that bad teachers, patently maleficent perpetrators of emotional or physical pain on their students, should not have the financial clout of their municipality to protect them when they've been caught. Why, then, are so many around me in such an uproar about holding accountable the men and women in blue — the ones who took an oath to serve and protect us — who negligently or purposefully harm others? Why are the supporters of this bill now accused of crossing the thin blue line?
So, please, let's keep the ""anti-cop"" rhetorical cat in the bag, folks. This bill is not anti-cop, and neither are its supporters. Unless of course, holding teachers personally accountable for viciously accosting a student during lunch duty is also ""anti-teacher."" Then we're simply not speaking the same language, and that's a shame, but not the issue at hand.
Sorry for the confusion.

Calling prepaid return envelopes accompanying this year's absentee ballot applications ""wasteful government spending,"" is simply a euphemism for, ""Don't trust Democrats.""
This year CT was given money via the CARES Act specifically for purposes related to voting. These funds must be used by the end of 2020 and any remaining funds will be returned to the federal government. The simple fact is that in this election, CT residents are not footing the bill for return postage.
Now let's take an honest look at whether this is costing CT ""millions of taxpayer dollars."" A little simple math exposes that statement as untrue. There are 1,289,737 active voters registered to a party* eligible to vote in the primary. Even if the state paid full 55-cent postage on each return envelope (which at this volume is extremely unlikely) the total is only $709,355.35. Clearly, this is not ""millions of taxpayer dollars.""
Moreover, since the government doesn't pay for any unreturned envelopes, the realized cost is likely much lower. And the effectiveness of reaching voters directly? Very high.
I think using CARES Act funds for this investment is not only worth it, it is the exact manner in which we were entrusted to spend it. It makes sure there are no barriers to people executing their constitutional right to vote during the pandemic.

The Fairfield Police Department invited residents and members of the media to join law enforcement 4 p.m. outside the Reef Road station, where town police will be accompanied by law enforcement from across Fairfield County as well as state legislators who oppose the bill, and other local leaders.
""While police officials generally do not speak about legislative matters, given the sudden and rushed nature of this legislation we feel the need to express our concerns regarding this bill,"" Fairfield Chief of Police Christopher Lyddy said in the news release. ""We ask that community members consider joining us on Monday in a show of solidarity.""
The state House of Representatives passed the bill, known as HB 6004, by an 86-58 margin Friday morning after a long and passionate overnight debate. The state Senate is scheduled to consider it this week. The bill is being considered after protests against racism and police brutality were held over the course of several weeks in Connecticut and across America following the death of Minnesota man George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.
The Fairfield news release specifically referenced the bill's proposed inspector general position, ability for towns to create civilian police review boards, changes to police protocols, and elimination of certain protection for officers and municipalities.
The government immunity section of the bill proved to be the most contentious during House deliberations, as municipal officials worried it would open them up to more lawsuits stemming from police actions and increase liability insurance. Under the bill, a government immunity defense could only be used if a, ""… police officer had an objectively good faith belief that such officer's conduct did not violate the law."""

The project in its entirety became a community endeavor. First, thank you Tori Mileti, a young Southport artist and recent Ludlowe alumna, who within a few hours created the artwork for the signs.
A huge thank you to Charlotte Hommel, who reached out as soon as she heard about the project to inform me of Johnson & Johnson's charitable arm that would match any donations.
Thank you to the many, many strangers who ordered signs and volunteered to help me deliver them.
An especially grateful thank you is owed to Debra Mahony, for her generosity and enthusiasm for this project. Debra ordered and delivered dozens of signs to her friends throughout town while always donating much more than was necessary.
Countless people donated far more than was requested for their single sign — to you all, I say the most heartfelt, ""thank you.""

The graffiti is believed to have happened between Sunday afternoon and Monday morning, according to police. A resident playing pickleball told the responding officer there had been no vandalism at the park as of 1 p.m. Sunday. There are no cameras in the affected area of the park, police said.

A recent letter to the editor suggested that the writer did not know why the RTM invited Fairfield's police chief to speak at a recent RTM meeting. I am happy to explain, and it provides an opportunity to remind residents about some efforts in town to deal with racial injustice.
After George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, the group My Brother's Keeper Alliance, an affiliate of the Obama Foundation, issued a request that mayors, city councils and other municipal leaders pledge to do four things:
Fairfield Warde Voices for Equity, a group from Fairfield Warde High School, sent a message to town leaders asking them to take the pledge. Selectwoman Nancy Lefkowitz signed on. RTM Majority Leader Jill Vergara signed on. I signed on. Then First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick and Police Chief Chris Lyddy signed the pledge. It was great to see so many town leaders commit to this task on a bipartisan basis.
Chief Lyddy has been very open about discussing police practices and listening to the community. Having the chief talk with the bipartisan RTM, the body that might consider revising or creating ordinances on this issue if advisable, about the use of force policies in Fairfield's police department was very helpful.
The RTM will certainly not be the only body in town that works to fulfill the pledge. Selectwoman Lefkowitz is co-chairing a task force, appointed by First Selectwoman Kupchick, on racial equity and justice, which will be an important part of carrying out our pledge and exploring other areas where change is needed. But we greatly appreciate Chief Lyddy and Deputy Chief Smith speaking with us to help educate the members of the RTM. We look forward to other ways that we can participate with the task force to make some positive changes in town.

Connecticut was hit hard early with over 47,000 cases of COVID and 4,300 lives lost. I have been proud of our state's response in combating COVD-19 and how the community has come together to flatten our curve and the latest seven-day average of positive COVID cases is under 1 percent.
And although our state numbers are improving there is discussion about how Connecticut voters will cast their ballots in November. There are many questions.
Will towns implement social distancing practices for voting? Will voting lines be long and unmanageable, and unsafe? Will some of our most vulnerable populations in contracting the virus, like seniors or health-compromised individuals, even go to the polls?
I believe the right to vote is a fundamental right and the very basis of our democracy, one to cherish and promote even during a pandemic. Therefore, I support legislation in a special session that would permit any voter who is concerned about contracting COVID-19 by standing at a crowded polling place to be able to vote by absentee ballot this November.
Current state law authorizes the use of an absentee ballot for six reasons, including a voter's active service in the Armed Forces; absence from town during all of the hours of voting; illness; religious beliefs; duties as an election official; and physical disability. This law needs to be expanded to protect those concerned about contracting COVID-19 at the polls.
Like any good policy initiative, there is always the risk of overreach that we need to be mindful of. For instance, using millions of taxpayer dollars to send every Connecticut voter an absentee ballot application with a postage paid return envelope for the August presidential primaries was wasteful government spending, especially when the outcome in both parties is predetermined and our state and federal governments are in so much debt.
In our upcoming session, let's make this common-sense change for the health of our constituents and the health of democracy. We must ensure every single person who wants to vote in November is given a safe way to exercise their right to vote. Nobody should need to make a decision between their health and their right to vote.

A recent technical error during a virtual meeting of the Fairfield Parks & Recreation Commission moves me to highlight some issues we have had for months now with the technology being used for town meetings.
As moderator of the RTM, I recognize that running these meetings virtually is challenging. I am grateful that the town's IT director has been handling the technical side of our RTM meetings so that I can focus on the content and flow of the meeting itself. But the RTM is still unable to hear live public comment or hold committee meetings because our technology apparently doesn't allow that. Five months into the pandemic, with lots of technological options out there, I don't understand why this has not been addressed by the administration. I have been told that I could have someone in my home answer a phone during the meeting to pick up and screen public calls and then let them through to the meeting. How can that possibly be the only solution? The town needs a system for this. If nothing else, have a town employee handle this.
I have also been discussing with the town IT department how to allow RTM committee meetings to take place again. We discussed using the conference call system that has been used by many of the boards and commissions. However, there are only three lines for that and there are five committees on the RTM, so there is no way to hold all committees simultaneously using this system.
Worse, the conference line is clearly unreliable. At this week's Parks and Recreation Commission meeting there was either a technical error or an error by the chairman that allowed the listening public, who had been told that they were muted, to be heard. I heard toilets flushing, people conversing, cars beeping ... it was outrageous and a very unprofessional appearance for the town. The town needs to fix this ASAP so that the public can hear the meetings and only be heard when they know they are being heard. Until they do fix that, the public must be warned on agendas and otherwise to mute their phones.
I'm very disappointed that this hasn't been worked out yet, so many months into the pandemic. I am sympathetic to the many things that the administration has had to handle during this time, and I am grateful for the care that has been taken to protect our residents. But I talk to RTM leaders in surrounding towns, and they have figured this all out. It is unacceptable that Fairfield cannot handle its town meetings as it should.

My family and I have lived on Old Post Road between Beach and South Benson since September 2001. We moved here from NYC immediately following the attacks on the World Trade Center. Our goal was to safeguard our growing family and raise our kids in a safe, suburban environment closer to nature and the rich history of Fairfield. In particular, what attracted us to the Historic District is its unique architectural and Revolutionary War history, as well as the proximity it afforded to the beach and downtown. The only drawback we have experienced in our many years of living here in Fairfield is the amount of traffic on Old Post Road during rush hours. Unfortunately, when traffic backs up on 95, which it does in morning and afternoon rush, impatient drivers exit off 95 and use Post Road and Old Post Road as a thoroughfare. With so many impatient drivers, we have seen significant traffic incidents occur, in particular at the four-way stop at Beach and Old Post Road within 100 feet of the 40-unit apartment complex you propose building.
READ MORE: 5-Story Apartment Building Could Replace Fairfield Masonic Temple
We welcome the redevelopment of the property you propose to develop, in particular as it has several apartments planned as affordable housing. However, we are concerned that the current size of a 40-unit apartment complex will add significantly more traffic to what is already a stressed stretch of road between Post Road and Old Post Road and Beach Road. As someone who grew up in Fairfield and has an affinity for the character of the town, I implore you to reconsider the size of your development and scale it back to a reasonable number of units. Forty apartments will potentially bring 80 additional vehicles to your development. Additionally, Beach Road will lose parking spaces as a result of the need for fire and police department line of sights from the street.
As you continue to seek approval for this project, I would ask you and our town official to take into account the traffic issues, as well as the unique nature of the historic architecture that surrounds your proposed development.

Thursday's ruling comes after Caitlin Clarkson Pereira tried to use public election grants for child care while running as a Democrat candidate for state representative two years ago, the Register reported.
A 2018 request from Clarkson Pereira to use public grant money to pay for child care was denied by the State Elections Enforcement Commission, according to the Register, which also reported the commission ruled in 2019 that Citizens' Election Program funds could not be spent on a babysitter. Clarkson Pereira then filed a complaint in Connecticut Superior Court with the support of Ellen Weintraub, the head of the Federal Election Commission, and several state officials, the Register said.

We have lived in the historic district on the Old Post Road in Fairfield since 1992. Over the years there have been many changes to our town and yet the character and charm of Fairfield has always been protected and preserved. Our Town Planning and Zoning and the Historic District Commission are to be commended for their oversight and dedication to keeping Fairfield such a terrific place to live and work. You mentioned that you were raised in Fairfield and share the same town pride.
During our meetings we have shared our concerns about your proposed 40-unit development at 131 Beach Road. We fully support affordable housing and understand the need to have housing for everyone in town. We are worried that a building this large on a tiny site is not in harmony with the historic district it abuts and will create safety issues if 40 more families are added to an already congested area.

We all know how backed up the Beach Road and Old Post Road intersections can get during peak times. The Town Hall Green campus, two churches, two schools, a few medical buildings, a social club, and a funeral home add to the volume. When the interstate is crowded commuters use the Post Road/Old Post Road as an alternate route along with emergency vehicles. A 40-unit building adds at least 50 more cars turning onto Beach Road during peak times and parking on Beach Road when spaces are full.
Could we work to reach a mutually agreeable solution? A lower, smaller building that fits the site and neighborhood would be welcome. Thanks for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Karen and Bill Winget"

I'm not writing a boilerplate version of all the other talking points CEA recommends, which are good and right.
This essay, by Dr. Shayla Griffin, should be your one and only lodestar for reopening schools. Read it. Do it. This is what's necessary.
Additionally, though, I am writing because I want to show you the email I just wrote to my peers and administrators in my district:
""After speaking with my collaborating teachers this morning (the Sunday before school 'reopens'), we are simply unsure when we'll be able to meet again for the near future, trying to prepare for what looks like a doomsday scenario for all parties involved ... sigh.
""I've been trying my best to put a silver lining on this ominous cloud, but it's getting more and more difficult as the storm approaches. Logistically, this is all untenable, but if it was solely a logistical nightmare, that's just a job for critical problem solving and compromise. And that's why admin gets paid the big bucks, amirite?
""But this isn't just administrative, a management puzzle to be solved.
""Putting students first and using this 'unprecedented' time as a ripe opportunity for systemic overhaul is good and right, but when you're worried that your friends, your students, your family, and/or you yourself very well might suffer disastrous health consequences for the sake of ... what?
""I'm not convinced that we're doing what's best for the collective good by going back into our classrooms, and it's making it ever more difficult to consider the future of my instruction when all inspiration has been supplanted by confusion and feeling expendable.
""So many of us are too scared to strategize, too petrified to plan. And, to be honest, I'm heading down that fraught road myself. And, no, I'm not super interested in 'talking it out' only to be told that 'it is what it is,' or that I need to see all this from a new perspective, one in which this intangible 'economic good' somehow overrides people's lives.
""So, for now, I'm going to pump the brakes on this collaboration session, at least for a few days until I can more bravely face the calamitous times ahead.
""And for the record, I'm not writing this for sympathy from above, as I know the administrators on this email can do little to nothing to clean up this mess; you're doing the best with the mandates you've been given.
""I'm writing this to empathize with the rest of you who I also know are frightened. We are damned if we do, and we are damned if we don't. The fight or flight is kicking in, at least for me, and I know which side I'm leaning towards ...
""I hope to 'see' you soon, in whatever proximity that entails.""
To be clear, I've never felt more passion to be anything in my life other than a teacher. I literally want to change the world, one student at a time.
But I am shaken to my bones, and just as no student can truly learn without feeling safe, the same is true for teaching. I cannot do my job with any semblance of efficacy if I fear sickness and death day in and day out. And neither can my peers. We are professionals, not miracle workers.
I am imploring you: please pump the brakes and let us get back to the business of doing what's best for all involved — the students, the parents, the teachers, and, yes, even the economy! — after you provide the necessary funds, resources, and protection for us all.
It's not our fault that most parties in power assumed a global pandemic was going to magically just ""get better"" by the time late August rolled around, that ""we'd cross that bridge when we came to it."" Frankly, it's yours. And I don't want to be your casualty in a war I don't believe in.
Please do what's right here — not for the imaginary ""economy"" or the inconvenienced, loud, wealthy, white minority. Do what's best for the collective good. If this entails a relatively healthy, younger teacher like myself ""goes into the building"" with the very few kids who need to be in the brick and mortar version of school, then so be it. If this entails adopting empty movie theaters as new classrooms, or mandating older kids stay at home while the younger ones spread across all the newly available high school buildings across districts, then so be it. If it requires that the speedy testing, which exists for those who are able to afford it (like those in the NBA bubble or at Hamptons galas) are also readily available for us every single day, then so be it.
But none of those things are happening ... yet.
So, it's time to take a pause. Give us time and resources and money and protection. When you've done your job, and when you're ready to ensure one or all of the above, then let us know. And, then let us continue changing the world, one student at a time.
Sincerely,
John Whaley"

August 26, 2020
Dear Fairfielders,
""I want to start of by sharing my sincere gratitude for your thoughts and prayers over the last week. After going through a very serious medical emergency last weekend, my son is now out of the hospital and working toward recovering. I can't begin to explain how terrifying and difficult it was for my husband and I, and how blessed we and our entire family feels to have our son still with us.
It meant so much to me to receive so many lovely and kind words of encouragement through email and on social media from all of you. I am truly grateful to be back at work on behalf of such a compassionate community.
Coincidentally, I am excited to announce that FEMA is awarding the Fairfield Fire Department a grant totaling $53,832 to purchase Cardiac Compression Devices and Automatic Defibrillators. I know all too well how critical these life savings devices are after my son's experience last week. I congratulate the Fire Department on their success and sincerely appreciate their commitment as first responders.
COVID-19 UPDATE:
With back to school approaching and students returning to our local Universities, COVID is top of mind for many parents and residents. The Town of Fairfield has 740 residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 and a total of 145 of our residents have sadly lost their lives. Of the 740 residents who have tested positive in Fairfield, 365 have reported that they have fully recovered and 213 are assumed recovered.
Charts and data on Fairfield cases including age, gender, nursing home statistics, testing samples, and different trend lines can be found at fairfieldct.org/covid19data. The Health Department has been providing data since March and this data page is updated daily.
Schools:
This week, the health department launched a separate page, fairfieldct.org/covid19schooldata to break out the student information, as children prepare to go back to school. You can also watch their recent video explaining the data here.
Many parents have written in asking why the school district didn't choose to have students return full time since the data shows low numbers of children testing positive in Fairfield. While this decision is the sole authority of the school administration and Board of Education, parents should be aware the Superintedent shared the biggest challenge for them for returning to full time in person school this fall, was maintaining the 6' distance in the classroom, which is a state requirement. You can learn more about the school district's decision in this video from Superintendent Mike Cummings.
Universities:
For information on the steps the Universities are taking to keep our residents and students safe, please scroll below in this email.
Governor Lamont last week made modifications to face covering requirements with his 66th Executive Order, which requires anyone declining to wear a mask or face covering because of a medical condition to have documentation of the condition. We continue to urge residents to wear a face covering when in public and unable to maintain a 6' distance.
Contact Tracing
One of the key tools we have to contain the spread of COVID-19 is Contact Tracing. For this initiative to be successful, the Health Department needs the cooperation of residents who test positive for COVID-19.
The primary purpose of contact tracing is to identify and notify direct contacts of confirmed cases as quickly as possible and to ensure those exposed are self-quarantining. The information provided in the interviews with confirmed cases helps reduce the potential spread of the virus in our community.
Any Fairfield resident who tests positive for COVID-19 and has not received a phone call from the Fairfield Health Department or the Connecticut COVID Tracing system within 24 hours of receiving their result is urged to contact the Fairfield Health Department at 203-256-3022.
Traveling? Please take the time to check the CT Travel Advisory page to know what states are on the list as most impacted. If you travel to these states, you are required to quarantine for 14-days upon return to protect the members of our community.
FAIRFIELD UTILITY & INTERNET RELIABILITY & RATES INFORMATIONAL FORUM:
While I wasn't able to attend, the Fairfield State Delegation co-hosted an Informational Public Utilities & Internet Reliability Town Hall via Zoom with special guest Attorney Lee Hoffman, Chair of the Connecticut Business Industry and Association (CBIA) Energy Group and Partner at Pullman and Comley. If you weren't able to participate, I encourage you to watch the video, specifically the portion from Attorney Hoffman for a great perspective on the history and current regulations with Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA).

On Thursday, August 27 at 10:30am, the legislative Energy and Technology Committee is hosting an informational forum via Zoom. This hearing is expected to cover a broad set of issues, from the role of state utility regulators and the process of setting rates to utility staffing levels and how the companies communicate with customers and municipalities during outages. United Illuminating and Eversource executives will participate.
While the public cannot participate in the hearing, email comments are encouraged. I submitted testimony on behalf of our town and Emergency Management Team you can read here.

I also want to note I will be speaking directly to the off campus students on zoom next week and our police have had several zooms with Fairfield University students who live by the beach and other off campus to portray the seriousness with which we take COVID-19 in the Town of Fairfield.
FAIRFIELD BICYCLE & PEDESTRIAN COMMITTEE:

The Town of Fairfield Bicycle and Pedestrian Committee has been working to encourage walking and biking for transportation, recreation, exercise and quality of life.
Working with multiple town departments we have established bicycle routes, installed bicycle repair stations, worked to improve pedestrian infrastructure, and authored the Town of Fairfield Complete Streets Policy (approved by the Board of Selectman in 2018).
With more and more of our citizens using our roads, we would like to provide you with some important safety reminders for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. View the document here.
FAIRFIELD POLICE: DISTRACTED DRIVING
Over the past decade, distracted driving has become one of the leading causes of vehicle crashes on our nation's roads. The Fairfield Police are encouraging drivers to put down the phone and remember: U Drive. U Text. U Pay.
In support of August's National Distracted Driving Awareness Month, the Fairfield Police will partner with the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from August 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, for the national U Drive. U Text. U Pay. high-visibility enforcement effort. The goal of the campaign is to step up enforcement efforts to catch distracted, texting drivers and enforce distracted-driving laws.
VOTING:
Polls will be open from 6 AM to 8 PM on Election Day sanitized with social distancing measures in place. If you do not wish to go to your polling place you may vote by absentee ballot.

The Secretary of the State (SOTS) will be sending applications for absentee ballots to all registered voters in the next few weeks. Completed applications should be mailed to Town Clerk, 611 Old Post Road, Fairfield CT, 06824 or they may be dropped off in the Lobby Dropbox located in Old Town Hall marked Town Clerk.

If you have already filed an Application for an Absentee Ballot, you do not need to complete the application sent to you by SOTS. This especially applies to college students who have already submitted their completed applications with their school address to which the ballot will be mailed. Absentee ballots will become available 31 days prior to the election.
Some residents have asked about the absentee ballot process:
The absentee ballots, after each being endorsed by the Town Clerk on the outer envelope with the date, precise time and their signature are presorted by voting districts and sent over to the Registrar's of Voters Office.

The Registrars then cross off the names on the Official Voter Lists of the absentee voters typed on each envelope. Each of those crossed off names are then Marked with a capital A so as to not be counted by the official checkers as having voted at the polling place.

The Registrars then appoint, train and swear in the absentee ballot counters.The counters report to the Moderator at the central count location or to the Polling Places.

The Moderator records the total number of ballots on the Certificate of Absentee Ballot Count.
The counters check each envelope to be sure it has been endorsed by the Town Clerk.
It must show the date, precise time the clerk received the ballot and the clerk's signature. If the outer envelope does not comply substantially with this requirement the ballot cannot be counted and is marked rejected with a statement for the reasons for the rejection. These envelopes are then placed in and sealed in a depository envelope.
The inner envelope is then inspected for having been signed by the voter. If not signed the envelope is marked rejected. If signed, folded ballots are removed from the inner envelope.
Ballots are then kept folded for voter secrecy. They are then shuffled, unfolded, and checked for marking errors.
They are then put into the tabulator machines for counting if there are no marking errors. Hand counted ballots with errors are inspected for voter intent by the counters and the moderator. Once the counting is completed all envelopes are sealed in large envelopes and returned to the Town Clerk for secure storage.
There are many other precautions which are outlined in the 'Procedure Manual for Counting Absentee Ballots' on the CT Secretary of the State's website.
If anyone is interested in working on Election Day in Fairfield, they should e-mail
Steve Elworthy at selworthy@fairfieldct.org or Matt Waggner at mwaggner@fairfieldct.org.
HEAT KILLS: If You Love 'Em, Don't Leave 'Em

It takes just a few minutes for the temperature inside a vehicle to skyrocket, sometimes causing entirely preventable tragedies. I worked hard to launch this program in 2015 with the Fairfield Police Department, which has been replicated throughout the state, in an effort to remind residents of the dangers of leaving their kids or pets in a car during warm weather. I thank all the stores who have posted these signs in their parking lots.

The district, which includes Fairfield, Newtown, Easton, Weston and Westport, is represented by state Sen. Tony Hwang, a Republican, who is being challenged in the Nov. 3 election by Democrat Michelle McCabe.
DeMatteo, 36, is a trial attorney with his own firm based in West Haven.
""He is running on a progressive and pragmatic platform to streamline and reform state laws to protect the liberty of our residents and promote the common good, which requires a balance of fiscal responsibility and public services,"" the news release said.
DeMatteo supports judicial reform, infrastructure improvement, and legalizing and taxing sports wagering and recreational marijuana. He also wants to provide incentives and resources for businesses to open and grow in Connecticut.
""While winning as a write-in candidate is a long shot, DeMatteo hopes that he is able to elevate important issues that are often overlooked by the major parties and candidates,"" the news release said."
59,/connecticut/fairfield/letter-editor-ct-housing-law-harms-neighborhoods-nature,2020-09-03T12:00:00Z,Letter To The Editor: CT Housing Law Harms...,9,21,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"Dear editor,
Across Fairfield, from High Street to Ruane Street and more, large, monstrous developments, all under the state's 8-30g affordable housing law, are either being built or in the midst of being heard by the Town Plan & Zoning Commission. This situation isn't unique as it's taking place across our state.
Some people may not be aware that these large monstrosities are popping up all over our town due to the state law, 8-30g, that allows developers to by-pass local zoning laws and create huge developments onto lots where single-family homes lived.
For background, this state affordable housing law is intended to encourage more affordable housing in towns that have less than 10 percent of their housing certified as affordable. Under 8-30g, local zoning regulations governing building height, lot coverage, distance from other properties and roads, density and property values can be ignored. Because zoning laws are superseded, profit-motivated developers can get extreme density by building out to lot lines with no restriction on height.
Aside from the ones listed, there are many more in the pipeline and every month we seem to see a new one. We can all agree that affordable housing is a laudable goal but a blanket law such as this one has severe unintended consequences, which harms our neighborhoods, destroys natural habitats for natural flood control and wildlife, and puts an immense burden on infrastructure.
Your neighborhood could be next. And it may get worse — if a proposed new bill further changing state zoning laws is approved in Hartford.
Development of any nature has a permanent impact on an entire town, and for this reason, it is critically important that local control of land use decisions remain with each town's zoning commissions. However, a new bill, co-sponsored by state Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey — HB 5132, would end up removing even more local control from local towns. The bill would erode local zoning regulations as it currently reads, because the assumption is that towns like Fairfield aren't attempting to support the construction of more affordable housing.
There is no paid lobby to help neighbors protect their land, and to do so, they have to hire expensive attorneys and experts to defend their most valuable possession and investment — their home. I've personally sat at TPZ meetings where I've seen scores of citizens like you and me who hope common-sense prevails, and over-sized developments that enrich developers don't pass. It's almost like David vs. Goliath. It's wrong and unfair. Yet it continues to happen.
What to do? There is one thing to do — vote. There is an election underway now for the General Assembly, the place where laws such as these are created each year. We have the opportunity to elect people who want reform when it comes to affordable housing laws and who want local control for zoning. Educate yourself. As you hear from candidates of all stripes who want your vote, ask them if they believe there should be reform when it comes to affordable housing and if they believe that zoning laws should be in the hands of local zoning boards, not politicians and lobbying groups. In addition, hold politicians who represent their constituents accountable for what they are doing. And more importantly, for what they are not doing — representing their constituents and interests.

60,/connecticut/fairfield/pcbs-found-near-wastewater-treatment-plant-fairfield,2020-09-03T08:55:57Z,PCBs Found Near Wastewater Treatment Plant In...,1,4,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — Work is underway to remediate PCBs found earlier this summer near the Fairfield wastewater treatment plant.
The contamination was uncovered in June as a result of construction for a capital project to protect the plant against coastal flooding, according to First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick, who said the construction site was closed for a couple of weeks after the discovery, but has since been cleared to reopen.
The town has been working to address the contamination with contractor Tighe & Bond, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, according to Kupchick. The PCBs are intermittently dispersed throughout the construction site, she said, and Tighe & Bond has been testing and remediating the affected sections.
""Some of the areas are clean and some are not,"" she said, noting the contaminated soil is outside the facility and won't affect work inside the plant.
Kupchick said material from the town fill pile was never used near the plant, which means the recent discovery of PCBs is unrelated to a public corruption scandal connected to illegal dumping at the pile and contaminated fill found at other locations in Fairfield.
""There is no evidence that this contamination is connected to the fill pile or other sites in town,"" Kupchick said Wednesday in an email to residents.
The wastewater treatment plant is, however, built on a former Project Nike missile control site, which is likely the source of the PCBs, according to Kupchick, who said the town has not yet identified the full cost and scope of the remediation.
The more than $7 million capital project under construction at the wastewater treatment plant includes building over 2,400 feet of steel walls that will surround the plant as well as the nearby fire training facility, animal shelter and conservation workshop building. More than $3 million of the project cost is being paid for by a federal grant."

In these heightened and sensitive times we sometimes forget that compromise is not just an option. It is a necessary part of getting along in the world.
You are probably accustomed to people protesting the change that a new structure can bring to a community. I understand that resistance comes with the territory in real estate development.
However, for us in the Old Post Road Historic District we don't feel our apprehension with your project is a symbolic gesture.
We welcome all newcomers who can enjoy our neighborhood and add to the vibrancy of it. It's a beautiful part of town and we like the idea of sharing it. This is how neighborhoods grow.
Our concern is that the parameters for this structure you have proposed would be neighborhood-altering, and once built, it cannot be undone. The current plans call for a building that would dominate the neighborhood with its outsized profile.
And this is where I think a compromise is not just an option, but the best option. We are not proposing an all-or-nothing solution. We embrace new people in our community. But we are concerned about the traffic and the congestion, which could create safety issues. And as a group, we believe the building is just too big.
I live a few hundred feet from the construction site. So I know this is a tricky situation. I'm sure there is a fair and balanced solution that will make all sides feel good about the plan.

I am deeply concerned that we will be decreasing the number of police officers in our school this coming year. It's even more troubling to know that the recently adopted partisan police accountability bill is contributing to this decision. We all understand that planning for this upcoming fall school semester is difficult and it is easy to second guess decisions in these unprecedented times. However, it seems illogical during a period where there will be increased school traffic, additional arrivals and dismissals, the possibility of using additional exterior doors for arrival and pickup, the heightened desire to get our children out of the classroom and into the school yard, all at a time while it won't be strange to see masked adults and young adults on school property.
Parents and staff are already anxious and scared about the fall reopening of schools. Student safety is vitally important now as we face an evolving and ever-changing environment. Officers dedicated to the Fairfield Police Department's S.H.A.P.E. program played a critical role with both school safety and fostering a positive relationship between the police, students and the community as a whole. It's disturbing that these important decisions appear to have been made without any input from parents or the public as a whole. Our children, teachers and police department deserve better.

We are writing to you regarding the development of 131 Beach Road. As residents of Old Post Road, we hope you'd consider reducing the scale of the project. A large apartment building simply isn't consistent with the character of the quaint Historic District. Additionally, it would further exacerbate the traffic and safety issues that already exist on Old Post Road.

With regard to traffic, it is often backed up at the corner of Beach and Old Post already. Another 50 to 60 cars traveling from 131 Beach will only add to the congestion. On the issue of safety, we can speak from experience. A woman who babysat for us was run over in a crosswalk by Town Hall (close to the proposed development site) in 2017 and suffered a blow to the head, which required a lengthy hospital stay. As a result of the trauma she still suffers from cognitive disorders and may never fully recover.
As a native of Fairfield, I am sure you will want to be sensitive to the views of your neighbors. The goals of affordable housing are noble, but they should be balanced with the character of the neighborhood and the safety of those that live there. Let's find a middle ground to compromise.
Thank you for your consideration.

I am writing to enthusiastically express my support for Cristin McCarthy Vahey, who is running for reelection to the Connecticut House of Representatives.
I have known Cristin for several years. We first connected when I initiated a traffic survey request and petition to the town of Fairfield Police Commission, seeking to install fog lines along Wilson Street. Cristin reached out to me to voice her support and sign the petition. We immediately connected over our shared concern about traffic, pedestrian, and cyclist safety issues. She shared with me how she originally became a passionate advocate for these issues while working for over three years to get desperately needed traffic light and intersection safety upgrades to the Stratfield Road/Melville Avenue intersection, where many children and families cross the street on their way to Stratfield Elementary School each day.
Since that first meeting, Cristin and I have continued to work together on various traffic, pedestrian, and cyclist safety issues in the Stratfield neighborhood, and she regularly champions traffic, pedestrian, and cyclist safety legislation at the state level. One of the things I appreciate most about Cristin is her dedication to these issues. I know that Cristin will not rest until our roads are safe and comfortable for all users, especially our children, who deserve to be able to walk, bike, skate, and scoot around their neighborhoods without fear of speeding vehicles and negligent drivers.
I have great respect for Cristin's professional work and personal work ethic. More importantly, I like and admire her because she is a kind and thoughtful person. Cristin is a proven and bold leader, a skilled listener and relationship-builder, and a tireless advocate for our town. Please join me in voting for Cristin McCarthy Vahey on Nov. 3.

We are writing this letter to ask that you reconsider the proposed size and number of units in your plans for 131 Beach Road. We have been residents here in Fairfield for over 30 years and when we met earlier in the summer you indicated that you yourself grew up in Fairfield. We feel, as might you, that the proposed building is simply incongruous with the Fairfield Historic District and the tone and tenor of the life in Fairfield that we all have grown to enjoy and hope to protect.
We agree that Fairfield as a town is in need of more affordable housing and that there are regulations that have been enacted to accomplish/fulfill those needs. However, we hope that the intent of those regulations is followed rather than pursuing the most extreme limits of allowable usage on the property.
As you are aware, the proposed site is adjacent to a high traffic medical building, and across the street from a church-based nursery school, a funeral home and a social club. Within two blocks of the site are Town Hall green and a second church-based nursery school. The parking and traffic demands of 40 units and almost 60 vehicles present too much of a safety hazard.
Can we all gather together and come to a mutually agreed upon solution to the development of this property that allows for providing affordable housing and still maintains the character of Fairfield?

Fairfield has waited over 33 years for the old Exide battery factory location on Post Road to be clean enough to be safely repurposed. Now it is ready!
In imagining all of the exciting possibilities for that location, I decided to pick up the phone and call the developer. We had a lovely conversation, and he is recognizing what I've recognized —businesses do in fact want to come here. He said that he's been in conversation with companies considering moving their headquarters here to Fairfield.
What was brownfield land can now be the home of a new, beautiful HQ. Companies are realizing their workers want to live in Connecticut. They can move their business closer to workers, pay lower taxes, reduce overhead with a smaller footprint, and improve everyone's quality of life with shorter commutes.
To my mind, taking a lunchtime walk around a yet-to-be developed path along the Exide property overlooking the Mill River and beautiful Southport Harbor make for an idyllic work environment. Additionally, Fairfield being the restaurant hub of the entire Gold Coast means workers can easily enjoy an after-work drink and dinner at any of our fantastic restaurants. Then instead of taking an hour-and-a-half train commute home, people can hop in their cars and be home in 15 minutes.
The development of the old Exide property means more tax revenue for Fairfield, which will offset individuals' property taxes, and it means more time for people to spend with their families rather than commuting.
The tide is turning for Connecticut, and I am excited to work in the legislature to attract companies here by making it simpler to operate with red tape reduction, longterm stability, and longevity and growth tax incentives. I look forward to optimizing our business climate so as to attract more opportunities just like this one.

""Low amounts of workforce, cutting important positions, and lack of movement within the departments to run crews have crippled all departments that once had Fairfield's roads bare and clean after any type of storm thrown at it,"" United Public Service Employees Union No. 454 said in an open letter provided to Fairfield Patch, which referenced recent resident complaints about post-storm response time.
Tropical Storm Isaias blew through town Aug. 4, with 50 mph winds that fully blocked more than 100 roads, uprooted hundreds of trees, and caused widespread power outages that lasted several days. Cleanup efforts were still ongoing more than a week after the storm, and at that time were expected to continue into late August.
""Since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the Department of Public Works has been drastically cut,"" the letter said. ""The DPW has seen most of its senior leadership roles unfulfilled and has seen 16 percent cut in total workforce.""
When foremen retire, their jobs are removed from the budget, phased out, or filled by cheaper, less experienced workers, according to the letter, which added the town is offering early retirement by Nov. 1, a move that could see many public works drivers replaced by part-time employees.
""During budget meetings when RTM members, Board of Finance members, and selectpersons ask our department heads if eliminating department positions at the DPW will affect town services or residents, our department heads respond with a quick 'no,' which has proven to be false,"" the letter said. ""… without the proper foreman and full balanced workforce in place the slow response will be the new norm for the town of Fairfield unfortunately.""
In a prepared statement, First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said she had not previously been approached about the complaints detailed in the union's letter.
""I'm grateful for the hard work our DPW employees do and for their dedication to our community. They always step up during storms to help clear roads and assist our first responders to keep our residents safe,"" she said in the statement.
""This is the first time these concerns are being brought my attention and I look forward to directly speaking with DPW and our HR Director in the coming weeks to address them, especially as we prepare for the next budget cycle."""

On Aug. 4, 2020, Tropical Storm Isaias came through Fairfield with over 50 mph winds and left the town with downed trees, snapped wires, and lots of cleanup. The town's Department of Public Works was ready and rearing to go for all the challenges and long hours of cleanup that this storm threw at us. That being said, the Department of Public Works agrees with the town of Fairfield residents who brought their concerns to First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick about the amount of time that it took to get organized, begin to cleanup, and for the process to be properly executed took longer than it should have. The Department of Public Works understands the frustration, but the residents should be given the truth of what has happened to a town who once took pride in prompt seasonal storm cleanups.
Since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the Department of Public Works has been drastically cut. The DPW has seen most of its senior leadership roles unfulfilled and has seen 16 percent cut in total workforce. The highway department alone has seen a decrease of 20.7 percent. When a DPW foreman retires, the town does not fill the position within to a qualified department member to take over that leadership role. Instead, the leadership position is either removed from the budget, is possibly filled with an inexperienced laborer at the lowest pay grade, or becomes ""phased out"" by not filling the position at all. During budget meetings when RTM members, Board of Finance members, and selectpersons ask our department heads if eliminating department positions at the DPW will affect town services or residents, our department heads respond with a quick ""no,"" which has proven to be false.
Within each department, the workforce needs to be able to move workers up the ranks with more responsibility to achieve a balanced and more constructive division of the DPW. All the departments are on the front lines when it comes to major storms and without the proper foreman and full balanced workforce in place the slow response will be the new norm for the town of Fairfield unfortunately. To make matters worse, the town of Fairfield is offering early retirement by Nov. 1, 2020, which would include a mass amount of DPW CDL drivers only to be replaced with part-time workers ""working less than twenty (20) hours."" This cycle of events will be a catastrophic blow to the town of Fairfield especially with snow right around the corner.
So where does this leave the DPW workers and the residents in the future of seasonal storms? Town employees continue to give 110 percent on a daily basis to make sure the town's roads, drainage, trees, parks, conservation, water treatment, and building maintenance are above and beyond normal standards. As a whole, we are proud of the work we do for the town of Fairfield residents. That being said, we can only do as much as your elected officials allow us to do. Low amounts of workforce, cutting important positions, and lack of movement within the departments to run crews have crippled all departments that once had Fairfield's roads bare and clean after any type of storm thrown at it. We understand your frustration, and hope this allows you to see our frustration.
We would like to thank our fire and police union brother and sisters for their support and the fantastic job they do for the residents of this town during emergencies and on a daily basis. We would also like to thank all the residents who brought out water and food with kind words of thank you to our Department of Public Works crews. It means more to us than you may think. Thank you.

More than 70 people logged on to Webex to listen and speak against a proposed affordable apartment complex abutting a historic district.
""The developer has not listened to anyone in the community about the size, scope and safety concerns,"" Fairfield resident Paul Fama said. ""… It's going to overwhelm the historic district.""
The project would replace the 1950 Masonic Temple building at 131 Beach Road. The five-story development would include 40 apartments, 12 of which would be rented below market rate, plus 55 parking spaces, with a ground-floor parking structure. The 0.65-acre site is less than a block from Old Town Hall.
Resistance to the proposal wasn't limited to Tuesday's hearing. Residents have also submitted numerous letters of opposition for publication on Fairfield Patch, and an online petition against the project has more than 1,300 signatures. The Old Post Road Area Association has hired an attorney to represent it in the matter, as has one individual Old Post Road resident.
""We urge the developer to reconsider the size and design of this project,"" said Henry Backe, president of the association, adding his group would applaud the plan if it was 50 percent smaller and included only affordable units.
Traffic safety is a major concern for residents against the development. Traffic engineer Michael Galante reported Tuesday that the complex is projected to generate 218 car trips in or out of the property on a typical weekday. As of January, Beach Road east of Post Road, near the site of the proposal, saw a total of 1,466 vehicles during its peak morning and evening hours combined. The block where the site is located has been the scene of five accidents in the last three years.
""We find the conditions on Beach Road … it's difficult to say safe, but are adequate,"" Galante said.
Developer 131 Beach Road LLC intends to remove one of the property's two existing driveways. The building would require a 319-foot sight line, which could be achieved by eliminating some parking spaces on Beach Road, according to Galante.
The developer is seeking approval under state law Section 8-30g, which dictates the only way the commission could deny the proposal is by proving it poses a threat to public health, safety or ""other matters which the commission may legally consider"" that outweigh the need for affordable housing. Section 8-30g applies to towns where less than 10 percent of housing stock meets state criteria to be recognized as affordable.
State Sen. Tony Hwang pushed Tuesday for the commission to examine the historical integrity of the neighboring properties as possible cause for denial.
""Local control and historical consideration has to be part of this process,"" Hwang said.
State Rep. Brian Farnen also spoke about the area's history.
""We need to be respectful of the historic nature of the location,"" Farnen said.
However, attorney Chris Smith, who is representing the developer, said at the first night of the hearing, which took place in July, that neighborhood consistency does not constitute a threat to safety under Section 8-30g.
The hearing will continue Sept. 29."

An online petition, created by the Fairfield Old Post Road Area Association, opposing the proposed massive five-story apartment complex at 131 Beach Road now has over 1,249 neighborhood signatures. Signatories include families in Fairfield including various state and town elected officials including Laura M Devlin, state representative, 134th District, and Brian Farnen, state representative, 132nd District of Fairfield.
Most importantly, though, is the threat to public safety in an already congested traffic area at Beach Road and Old Post Road intersections. The development could add over 80 additional cars to this area and require by law the surrender of 12 critical parking spaces on Beach Road for the project to be approved.
Justly concerned, the historic and beach area residents are appalled and have raised massive funds to fight this development. The proposed 40-apartment complex rising over 60 feet would change the historic complexion of Fairfield forever.
This structure would be directly across the street from First Congregational Church, founded in 1639, and abut several historical homes. Moreover, the height of the proposed building would be viewable from nearly every home on the Old Post Road; all historic houses that represent the legacy of historic Fairfield.
The affordable housing act, also known by the code of 8-30g, has taken Fairfield by storm. Almost everywhere you look Fairfield is taking on a new appearance in the form of condominiums and large apartment complexes. The best example is the unsightly apartment building directly next door to St. Thomas Church on the Post Road.
Slowly our charming town with a history that dates back to the early 1600s is becoming another Norwalk or Stamford or even worse Westport, a town inundated with affordable housing projects.
When a neighborhood decides to challenge such a project and it gets denied, it ends up in Connecticut Superior Court where nearly 90 percent of these projects are won on appeal in Hartford with the local towns having to comply with the law and unsightly developments.
Reasonable people would agree that affordable housing is a good thing. It just doesn't benefit one segment of the population; it also helps the elderly who may want to downsize to stay in Fairfield, young people just starting out, and firemen and policemen.
At what point do we, as Fairfield residents, say ""enough is enough?""

It's with a great sense of purpose that I respectfully ask the Fairfield Town Plan & Zoning Commission to oppose the proposed development at 131 Beach Road. The development was filed under the state's affordable housing statute, 8-30g. Under 8-30g, local zoning regulations governing building height, lot coverage, distance from other properties and roads, density and property values can be ignored. Instead, the sole criteria is a test of public health and safety. Throughout Fairfield and Connecticut, developers are routinely using 8-30g to propose projects in areas where housing is unsuitable and would not otherwise be built.
The proposal would convert the former Masonic Lodge into large four-story apartment complex. Parking on the site would be above ground, under the first floor, which realistically makes the complex five stories high and over 60 feet in height with a total of 40 apartments including one- and two-bedroom units.
For the last several weeks, the neighbors, who have resided in the neighborhood for years and who have in-depth knowledge of traffic flows, have cited ample reasons not to have the development built.
The neighbors have described the area as very congested given Beach Road is already home to several medical offices, a church, a funeral home, a social club, a food pantry and other businesses. I believe there are legitimate concerns on safety and the impact on traffic in already dense and highly utilized intersections at Post Road and Beach Road and Beach Road and Old Post Road. The structure could add up to 80 additional cars to this already over-burdened stretch of road and could potentially eliminate on-street parking spaces there. I routinely travel this area multiple times a week and can personally attest to traffic issues.
Finally, the proposed complex at its maximum height reaches over 60 feet, and fills almost every square inch of the property. The neighbors have stated they would support another scaled back complex that is less intrusive and safer than what is being proposed.
We have to realize that not every site will accommodate every development.
Sincerely,
Alexis Harrison

As a long-time resident of the beach area, I am writing to oppose the proposed 60-foot, 40-unit apartment complex on a 0.65 acre lot size at 131 Beach Road, where the former Masonic Lodge is situated.
For background, the developer is using the state's affordable housing statute (8-30g) that allows development of any size building, superseding town zoning laws.
After speaking with the neighbors who reside close by, in particular, I am concerned about the public safety and traffic issues that the development could potentially bring. Beach Road alone has multiple office and medical buildings, a church, a food pantry, a club, a funeral home and other businesses. The structure could add up to 80 additional cars to this already congested stretch of road and could potentially eliminate on-street parking spaces there.
We have to realize that not every site will accommodate every development.
I hope the developer would be agreeable to scale back the project in a way that addresses the public safety and traffic concerns of the community and neighbors.

What we love about Fairfield is the vibrancy of a well-used historic district that brings the past together with the present and gives us hope of an even brighter future. Every day you can see people from all neighborhoods walking, running and biking. It is a place for concerts in the summer, pumpkin carving in October, and the tree lighting in December. Big events bring streams of people for the half-marathon, Memorial Day Parade and July Fourth fireworks display. It is walking distance from downtown, the beaches and home of many Revolutionary War structures and our Fairfield History Museum.
We feel very fortunate to have walked both of our daughters to Sherman school, and they walked or rode their bikes to visit friends. My wife and I would always caution them to be careful as there were many cars on the Old Post Road especially when I-95 would cause cars and trucks to find an alternative route. We were especially concerned about the corner of Old Post Road and Beach Road, as the four-way stop sign would cause many cars to wait for the intersection to clear, and impatient drivers wouldn't look for pedestrians or bikers. There were more close calls than I care to recount.
This is one of the reasons my family and I are very concerned about the five-story, 40-unit building planned in the place of the former Masonic Temple. It would bring cars from the residents, their visitors, as well as delivery and maintenance trucks to an already overcrowded area. Its parking area is too small, creating a self-imposed parking problem thereby adding more cars to a street that currently sees too much traffic.
Also, the structure itself dwarfs its neighbors and is out of place across from two historic churches and the Town Hall. When people come down the Old Post Road, they should not have to see the fourth and fifth floors of the building and the bright lights from the parking lot that will inevitably shine in your neighbor's windows at night. The building is oversized and has no outside green space for its residents, or even balconies to enjoy fresh air or a view.
Although we respect and welcome much-needed affordable housing, it seems that utilizing the 8-30g housing statute has been a way to bypass reasonable development concerns by citizens for this area. We are fully supportive of affordable housing in Fairfield, and we would be happy with a building half the size of all affordable housing units.
Our family fully supports rebuilding our community. My wife and I completely renovated our 1947 home on the Old Post Road, adding features like apple trees and a native flower garden reminiscent of the Jennings Estate that once stood where our home was built. We welcome everyone in this beautiful historic district and neighboring areas who share the love of this community to make it an inclusive place for future generations to enjoy.
We are asking you, Glenn, as one who grew up in this quaint town, to reconsider the size and density of this proposed development. Please be instrumental in keeping this neighborhood safe by lowering the density of traffic where our children walk to school, ride their bikes and parents stroll their babies, this would show respect to the needs of your neighbors and the surrounding community.
Sincerely,
Paul and Stacy Fama"

My husband and I were part of the group of neighbors from Old Post Road who met with you this spring regarding your current plan to develop the property at 131 Beach Road. You wanted to show us your conceptual drawings for an apartment building you are seeking to build located where Fairfield's Masonic Temple currently resides. As a new development affecting the Old Post Road Historic District, we were anxious to hear what your vision was for the property. We are 30-year residents of the Old Post Road and have spent many years carefully renovating and maintaining our home, built in the 1840s. We are proud that our neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as the history of this area is legendary. Even though the Masonic Temple building you seek to demolish was only built in 1950, the Freemasons have a long history in Connecticut, dating back to 1750. The Fairfield Chapter began in 1810, and many prominent men in Fairfield were members. As you can imagine, we were curious about the development you were proposing as it would directly abut and impact the Historic District.
Prior to our meeting with you, I researched your website. Based on your webpage and company name, Love Where You Live Homes, I felt like you were a developer who would take into account the dynamics of the surrounding neighborhood. You obviously take pride in your work and care deeply about constructing high quality single-family homes and condos, that make people ""proud to call home."" On your webpage it says you ""have always been a part of the 'green movement' evident by your passion for landscaping."" The Village at Southport, a recent ""Love Where You Live"" development, is ""a transitional tribute to the historic beauty of Southport, CT — The ultimate lifestyle for modern commuters and empty nesters alike."" Beautifully constructed with cedar shingles and lovely gardens, and a roof terrace for residents to enjoy. Based on this, you seemed like the kind of developer who would take pride in a project in an area with such historical significance. Imagine my surprise when the plans you presented for 131 Beach Road were for a 40-unit, 5-story, vinyl-clad boxy building, erected over an open parking lot, asphalt and pavement covering the entire lot, without any outdoor green space or common area for residents to enjoy.
When we and our neighbors expressed our concern over the density and height of your project, you stated that the plan you presented was the only ""product"" that was feasible for this site. You mentioned that you might be willing to lower the building one floor if the residents did not object to the rest of your plan, but that eliminating one floor would be conditional on your ability to scale back the 30 percent affordable housing component. Clearly 131 Beach Road is a development quite different than other ""Love Where You Live"" projects you have built in the past. You indicated to us that it was in your best interest to build the largest, most tightly packed apartment building possible. But this seems counter to the very idea of who you are as a builder. You stated that your targeted market of renters was senior citizens, town employees, firefighters, and divorced singles. Why then would you design a building that resembles a dormitory? There is no outdoor space, no common rooms or bicycle facilities, or even secure parking. Do you not care whether the renters in this building ""love where they live"" as well?
I understand that Fairfield does not have enough housing that is affordable to everyone. And that in response to this, Connecticut passed a statute, 8-30g, which encourages private developers (who otherwise would not build affordable housing units as the profit margins are too low) to add a percentage of lower priced units to their developments. Using 8-30g for 131 Beach Road, you are allowed to bypass all local zoning regulations, as to setbacks and height and density, and are given generous tax credits in return for designating 30 percent of your units as ""affordable,"" for a term of 40 years. (And after 40 years these units can then be rented or sold at market rates.) For people and families who meet the income eligibility requirements, i.e. those who make 60 to 80 percent of the area median income, this is a good thing as they will have more choice as to where they live. Your building, as proposed, has 12 affordable housing units with seven two-bedroom units for incomes at 80 percent and five one-bedroom units for incomes less than 60 percent. According to the Fairfield Housing Authority, in 2020, based on your plans, seven two-bedroom apartments can be rented to families earning $78,500 or less, provided they qualify financially in other areas, and five one-bedroom apartments would be available to people who earn less than $41,212 as a single, or less than $49,062 as a double. This seems admirable, in and of itself, but not at the expense of having an additional 28 market-rate apartments in a location that will completely overwhelm a quiet area of single-family homes. By adding more traffic and noise, will your tenants will actually enjoy living in such a cramped space with nowhere to go but out on the street? No senior citizens that I am aware of. But I am sure it would be most attractive to students at Fairfield University.
Please, Glenn, we only ask that you consider and respect our views. Your past involvements with many notable nonprofit associations demonstrate that you can be a generous, community-oriented person. For example:
Clearly, your record demonstrates that you have a strong belief in giving back to the community. Why not continue that record and do so here? Make 131 Beach Road a development that everyone will love — a scaled-down complex that fits the space and gives tenants a lovely home and neighbors something of which to be proud. During this time of social distancing, and the uncertainties of the future, we need more compromises, not less. You can be the developer who steps out of the ""8-30g Big Box"" mentality by making 131 Beach Road a building that is based on smart growth. And it can be done with a two or three (not five as proposed) story building with a smaller footprint, enclosed parking, and safe green areas. As you yourself know, the value of open space can't be ignored. Children need play areas where they don't have to cross the street. Studies have shown that having access to gardens significantly lowers stress levels. You spoke of your fondness for growing up in Fairfield when it was much less crowded than it is today. Please, we don't need another unfriendly, towering structure here in order to solve Fairfield's lack of affordable housing. You are a smart businessman, and have built many lovely buildings all over Connecticut. Please listen to our community pleas and do so here.
Sincerely,
Ann Jones

October 30 2020
To the Editor:
While running for office, Governor Lamont learned early that many Connecticut taxpayers did not want tolls because they knew this was another tax. This was why he changed his proposal to ""trucks only."" Big surprise that once elected the Governor's plan became tolls for all, not just trucks.

As House ranking member of the Connecticut General Assembly's Transportation Committee, State Representative Laura Devlin was a leader in the fight against tolls. Legislators like Laura and the group No Tolls Connecticut educated the public on what tolls really meant to taxpayers - turning our state into the most densely tolled in the nation, enabling continued misuse of revenue intended for transportation infrastructure, and an easy way to continue to grab more money out of the pockets of Connecticut taxpayers. When the plan was declared dead, we all breathed a collective sigh of relief. But we should still be holding our breath.

Laura and others recognize the toll plan ended only because democrats could not risk such an unpopular proposal in an election year. A number of democrats would likely be defeated in the upcoming election if they voted in favor of tolls and they could not afford to lose their majority stranglehold in Hartford. So politics being what it is, the democrats declared tolls ""dead."" But make no mistake - tolls are not dead; the issue of tolls is merely waiting to creep back into the next legislative session.

The democrats fooled many into thinking the Governor would stick to truck only tolling. Now they want us to believe they would not bring tolls back. But they will. It is imperative that anti-toll candidates are elected in November. Your vote for Laura Devlin is critical to ensure she is re-elected and will continue the fight against tolls when they are proposed again next session.

Local Environmentalist supports Brian Farnen for Fairfield… and Joe Biden for America
As a lifelong environmentalist who dedicated a large portion of my legal career to protecting parcels of land throughout Fairfield County from over-development, pollution and habitat loss, I put my vote with State Rep. Brian Farnen (132). I'm also voting for the Biden-Harris ticket on the national level (this letter will focus on the local race because the national discourse is already well known but suffice it to say the current president gets an 'F' on the environment).
We must maintain local control over the land without our Town's boundaries – there are 169 municipalities in our State, and historically this has been so. The obvious need for regional guidance and collaboration does not negate the need to make land use decisions by local people who know the land, what it is adjacent to it and how it works in the best interest of our environmental, economic and public health and welfare.
Brian Farnen is a dedicated Fairfielder who will work hard to maintain that local control so that we can continue to protect our environmental health with wise legislation that doesn't have devastating unintended consequences, such as the much maligned 8-30g statute which promotes affordable housing on the backs of the strength of our communities and our environmental health.
Land is finite and land is unique. Decisions are permanent and have far reaching impact and can't be reversed. As a former founding member of FairPLAN, three-term RTM member (2009-2016), current Zoning Commissioner, this letter does not reflect my position on any specific issue or project but it reflects the level of understanding and deep concern I have about the impact of our State laws on land use and the far reaching, permanent, and sometimes destructive effects of land use decisions.
Our land use and the impact it has on our environmental health is not partisan. Our environmental health shouldn't take a back seat to any other issue. We face profound issues that require strong, smart leadership recognizing that environmental health is as important as the need for example for housing- but we're smart and we can and must deal with both issues.
The environmental issues we face run the gamut from the local and long term effects of the current US president's dismantling of federal clean air and clean water regulations and practices; the effects of climate change (worsening storms, erratic weather shifts, flooding, sea level rise, draught), the impending collapse of the pollinators needed for the entire ecosystem and for our food supply, damage done locally by our dependence on fossil fuels, air pollution that travels east from the midwest, the effects of water, air, light and noise pollution on what remains of our natural systems.
We must prioritize and recognize that when we lose open space on both large and small parcels of land, we lose the multiple benefits natural land provides, from passive recreation to animal habitat, to migratory stopover for songbirds, to natural greenways, to riverine protection, to natural flood control to air and water pollution remediation.
As a lifelong environmentalist I support State Rep.Brian Farnen and implore you all to do so - once we lose our ability to control and protect our land we lose the ability to protect our environmental health and the welfare of our community.
Brian is smart and dedicated- please help him to help our Town! Vote for Brian Farnen for State Assembly (132).

Dear Editor,
I am very pleased to be supporting Joanne Romano-Csonka for State Representative in the 133rd district. I've had the good fortune to know Joanne for many years and I've seen firsthand her common-sense, straight talk and smart approach to issues. In particular, I am impressed with Joanne's knowledge of affordable housing laws and her commitment to change a proposed blanket state law that will remove local jurisdiction from zoning commissions which will destroy our neighborhoods.
Across Fairfield, from High Street to Beach Road to Ruane Street and more, large, monstrous developments, all under the State's 8-30g Affordable Housing law, are either being built or in the midst of being heard by the Town Plan and Zoning Commission. Some people may not be aware that these large monstrosities are popping up all over our town due to the State law, 8-30g that allows developers to by-pass local zoning laws and create huge developments onto lots where single-family homes were. My own street, Beacon View Drive was also under attack by 8-30g but luckily, the application was denied by Zoning after a long and stressful fight.
Our current state representative, Cristin McCarthy Vahey, has sat silent on 8-30g even though it is destroying neighborhoods and the people whom she represents. Even worse, Rep. McCarthy Vahey has sponsored a bill, HB 5131, which would end up removing even more local control from local towns. The bill would erode local zoning regulations and as it currently reads, because the assumption is that towns like Fairfield aren't attempting to support the construction of more affordable housing.
We all love Fairfield and love the small-town character it has. Why would we want a leader who wants to destroy that very fabric and everything that we hold precious?
Please vote for Joanne Romano-Csonka on November 3.

Leeper—Prepared to Hit the Ground Running
You know the popular depiction of politicians as glad-handing salesmen who charismatically smile for the camera, shake hands and pinch babies' cheeks? It's a popular image, because all too often those who are good at packaging themselves are the ones who win elections. The unfortunate truth about elections is that candidates who devote more time thinking about how to win than they do what they believe in and what they want to accomplish are much more likely to win.
I whole-heartedly support Jenn Leeper, because she defies this stereotypical mold of an empty politician. She has carefully researched and planned policy objectives that she will advance when she is elected. Rather than attend ribbon cuttings, she has thought deeply about her goals and how to achieve them and is ready to hit the ground running. In formulating her policy goals, she has reached out to community experts for their opinions and guidance—these experts (in tax policy and finance, for example) are one of our town's and state's greatest and yet most underutilized assets. She knows to leverage these important assets, because she is smart and an astute collaborator; and her resulting policy positions—for example, for how to help rebuild our economy—are thoroughly grounded in data.
Jenn does not equivocate to garner votes. Instead, she very openly supports or opposes issues: She has clearly laid out her perspective and opinions for all to see on her website and blog. She also has a clear record of uncompromised support for education (having consistently voted for education budgets, school infrastructure projects and teachers' contracts); as well as supporting essential school infrastructure projects (including the once-controversial proposal to air condition all town schools and expanding Mill Hill Elementary School to a 504 capacity); supporting environmentally friendly projects like solar panels at our schools (when others caved to parochial neighbor concerns about ""aesthetics""); and directly and unambiguously committing to social justice, equality and anti-racism work.
Brian Farnen's record and policy goals are less clear. Mr. Farnen's campaign website does not outline any plans. As an RTM member (a body on which he served for three terms, or 6 total years), Mr. Farnen voted for education budgets that had been cut; voted against multiple teachers' contracts; did not support air conditioning all of our schools; failed to take a position on the size of the Mill Hill renovation (which could have expanded our building capacity); restructured the Senior & Disabled Tax Relief Committee in a way that led to its ultimate inaction and failure to advance much-needed tax relief; and would not co-sponsor the bipartisan plastic bag ordinance, which was the only environmental ordinance passed in all of the time that Mr. Farnen served. Given this record, Mr. Farnen's tenure on the RTM cannot be characterized as pro-education or pro-environment; neither was it pro-seniors nor bi-partisan.
Jenn Leeper is the solid choice of substance, word and action. Jenn Leeper is truly poised to move our town and state forward, and I hope that Fairfield and Southport join me in supporting the best candidate for the job—Jenn Leeper.

October 29 2020
The Sensible Choice
What are some of the hallmarks of a good representative and leader? Considerate,
empathetic, and caring are fine qualities to hope for and expect. If Trumbull wants our
representative from the 134th District to vote with these ideals in mind, then there is only one
candidate we can vote for and that is Carla Volpe.
Carla is someone who will support family leave, a higher minimum wage, and measures
that support the Black Lives Matter movement.
A representative that supports family leave is considerate and practical. Taking time off
to care for a newborn child is something that all parents worry about, regardless of their
employer or financial situation. Bills passed in Connecticut offer a cost-free solution to taxpayers
by setting aside some of the taxpayer's money for when this need arises. This is a win for
business and families.
An empathetic representative supports an increase in the minimum wage. Carla
understands that some people don't have access to the same education and employment
opportunities but should still be able to make a living. Connecticut recently changed the
minimum wage to $15 spaced out over a few years and linked it to inflation.
Finally, a caring representative supports the Black Lives Matter movement and votes for
protections against police violence. Our representative should understand that Blacks have
been disproportionately affected by police brutality and racism in every state including
Connecticut. Voting for measures that support investigating police shootings and police training
on racial issues is a part of that.
The representative who will vote yes on these issues and others to come is Carla Volpe.
Carla is a teacher in Connecticut who firmly believes in funding education. She is a lifelong
Trumbull and Fairfield resident involved in her community. A Democrat, endorsed by the
Independent party, who believes in a better Connecticut economy with less income tax and
more tourism, is a candidate we can rally around. Above all, Carla is the person we need to
elect if we want our representative to be considerate, empathetic, and caring.

October 29 2020
TONY HWANG – THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE
As a mother and daughter writing a letter in support of Tony Hwang, we want to share some of the qualities that impress us about him.
Tony Hwang supports equality and empowerment of women! First, look at Tony's family, which we believe is always the best evidence of one's values and character. Daughter Christina has flowered into a young adult who is capable, independent, bright, thoughtful, fiercely opinionated in a good way and lights up any room she enters. Christina does not share all her Dad's views and the often-rousing debate at the Hwang house is a testament to that. And while we are at it, we must mention son Peter, also a great kid, intelligent, achieving, focused and a kind and caring friend. The Hwang children have been buoyed by the support, encouragement, and endless love of their parents. And then there is Tony's wife Grace, who in Tony's eyes holds the pedestal position in the family. Tony could not be prouder of Grace's accomplishments in all areas of life, personal and professional. He is her most fervent cheerleader.

The indelible mark Tony's parents made on him with their stories about escaping Communist China to live in Taiwan colors many of his views today. Then his Mom had the strength and fortitude to stay behind in Taiwan and manage the family alone while Tony's Dad came to the US to seek better opportunities for their future. Tony will always fight hate which is especially important to us, given the rise of anti-Semitism and racism in our country. Tony cherishes our rights and freedoms and will stand against anything that compromises them.

We do not understand how Tony does it; every time we turn around, he is there. Think about it, besides being omnipresent in our community, he is also spending many hours each month in Hartford on our behalf, building working relationships, finding common ground across the aisle and trying to change the worrisome downward slope our state is traveling. We need Tony's fiscally responsible voice. Don't we pay enough taxes already?

We need our State Senator capable of making the difficult decisions wisely. He understands that thin line between supporting constituents and ensuring the survival of businesses that employ those constituents.

Tony Hwang is a thoughtful leader who is fighting for our best Connecticut. During the recent devastating Storm Isaias, he was out there personally doing what he could to help our citizens. Tony listens to our community and he keeps us informed. Let's allow him to continue to make us our best, Vote for Tony Hwang on November 3rd.

October 29 2020
As Selectwoman of Fairfield, I know without hesitation that in this moment in our Town's critical history, we need Jennifer Leeper in Hartford; she's exactly the partner my friend, Cristin McCarthy Vahey needs alongside her, as we collectively navigate these challenging and unprecedented times.
Fairfield needs Jennifer Leeper and not just because she's nice and sociable (which she is, like her opponent both of these) it's that she's smart, thoughtful, and she's no stranger to hard work. Jennifer has integrity.
Jennifer's transparent and straightforward. She's not going to spew BS to earn votes and curry favor – and especially in this moment, we don't need empty promises, we need results. We don't need leaders who simply show up; we need leaders who will, upon arrival, advocate for us, fight for us …not for the spot in the photo op. We need leaders to stick their necks out for us. We need leaders who will tell the truth audaciously. Jennifer Leeper is that person.
In this Covid-19 world, Jennifer wants to move Fairfield forward in a healthy, safe and productive way that is clinically sound and economically prudent.
Jennifer infuses a serious demeaner with an appropriate amount of good humor. She's serious about job growth in this current climate and good governance and improving transportation. She's very serious about our schools. In fact, Jennifer has a proven track record of success as an elected member of our Board of Education. Jennifer is a mom of two young boys; she's been advocating for our schools, our teachers and our students before hers even went to school or learned at a distance.
Jennifer Leeper will continue to be a strong voice for the 132nd and for us all, we just need to give her the platform and opportunity.
Please vote for Jennifer Leeper on November 3rd

I'm proud to support my friend and mentor, Cristin McCarthy Vahey for State Representative in the 133rd. As the Democratic Selectwoman of Fairfield, Cristin has informed my own style of leadership. We challenge one another's assumptions; question each other along the way; we agree; we disagree; we're in continual conversation about what's in the best interest of this town and in the health, safety and well-being of all who live here.
Cristin does her homework, so that when she shows up (which she often does) on zoom or in person (at a distance, of course) she's well prepared. Using the tools at her disposal -- the wisdom of her own experience, the perspective of others, and facts – Cristin expends her time, energy and emotional resources for the betterment of our community. I'm sure she sleeps, but it's not unusual to receive a middle-of-the night, comprehensive Covid update, followed by an early morning missive pertaining to a previous discussion we were having about State business.
Cristin advocates for justice for all, equality, education, access to healthcare, affordable housing, and parity for women --- not simply to ""fight a good fight"", but because in her bones she's been called to do what's right.
Cristin is always working to turn someone's bad day into a good one; I know because I have been that someone on multiple occasions. She doesn't look for credit; instead Cristin is driven by a deep desire to be the good in the world, to lead by example.
Cristin's belief system has been challenged, but she's always able to stay true to herself and in so doing, gives strength to those around her, even as her own faith falters. Regardless of what's thrown at her, Cristin retains an enviable sense of optimism that a better future will prevail.
Cristin is the antidote to the times we're living in; she's a hero among us and I assure you, like all respectable heroes, she wears a mask.
If you live in the 133rd please cast your ballot for Cristin McCarthy Vahey.

I am a 17-year-old who lives in the 134th district. I moved to this district in 2014, when Laura Devlin first ran for State Representative. Throughout her entire six years serving as the State Representative of the 134th district, Mrs. Devlin has communicated only two times with me and my family. I have sent countless emails regarding multiple pieces of legislation, but have received only one response. One response, during her six year tenure! The other time that Mrs. Devlin knocked on our door, when she first ran in 2014, she asked us for our vote, not our concerns! Mrs. Devlin did not explain her policies, nor did she share her vision for the State.
That is why, in this election for State Representative, I am supporting Carla Volpe. Mrs. Volpe is a Democrat who is also endorsed by both the Working Families and the Independent Parties. (This is the first time that the Independent Party has NOT endorsed Laura Devlin.) Mrs. Volpe has made me feel that she cares about me and the citizens of the 134th. She has done that by listening to my concerns and speaking with me about the issues that affect me and the 134th. Mrs. Volpe doesn't care that I'm only in high school. She treats me like I am a constituent. She cares about what I think. We need someone who cares about us, who cares about their constituents, no matter their race, color, or age.

Cristin McCarthy Vahey is a former social worker known for her empathy and commitment to helping others. I first met Cristin when she knocked on our door as part of her constituent outreach. During our initial discussion, I confided in Cristin my desire to get more engaged in both politics and the nonprofit sector, after having spent many years working in a large corporation. Cristin kindly leveraged her extensive network to help me make important connections, and with her encouragement, my husband, David Schiffer, and I joined the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee.
Cristin also introduced us to individuals who worked at The Triangle Community Center (TCC), which provides services to the LGBTQ+ community in Connecticut. Elliot Leonard, a TCC board member, became a friend and mentor. He and his husband, Roger Litz, are the founders of the newly launched Leonard-Litz Foundation, which will support the LGBTQ+ community by funding nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations in the Northeast U.S.. Elliot and Roger recently appointed me the executive director of the Foundation, which will begin its first funding cycle by early 2021.All of these positive outcomes were set in motion the day Cristin knocked on our door, and are a testament to Cristin's passion for helping others. Cristin moves purposefully and passionately to address the compelling issues facing her constituents. Her energy, her drive, and her boundless empathy, which she demonstrates daily through her work in state government, make her a personal hero of mine.

To the Editor:
As a young Fairfielder studying public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, I proudly write in support of Rep. Laura Devlin's re-election, and I ask all voters of the 134th district to consider her outstanding commitment to young people in Fairfield and across the great state of which I am proud to call home.
Laura Devlin is the thorough, compassionate, and dedicated representative that policy students across the country aspire to be. Her commitment to bipartisanship is at her core during a time when our community, state, and country need it most; this sincere dedication is demonstrated in her work on the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue, and Bonding, Education, and Transportation committees, where Laura passionately advocates to make Connecticut a more ideal place to live and work in partnership with Democrats in Hartford. Laura is guided by one authentic belief — it is her duty to do what is right for Fairfield, Trumbull, and our state, always with her constituents and future generations in mind.
I have known Laura since I was in middle school in Fairfield, and her passion for serving her constituents and future residents of our state has manifested in her dedication as a mentor to local students interested in government, policy, and community service. Laura not only understands that young people are important stakeholders in state policy decisions, but she actively seeks to engage them in the democratic and legislative process. I have Laura to thank for getting me involved in local and state issues, and it is from her that I learned we all have an obligation to make our communities better, to serve the marginalized, and to attack the tough issues facing our state head-on.
I am beyond fortunate to have Laura Devlin as a role model for serving one's community, and we are incredibly lucky to have her as our representative. I encourage all voters of the 134th district to enthusiastically send Laura back to Hartford to fight for us.

Over the last six years I have spent a great deal of time at the state capitol advocating for improved food and environmental policy in CT. I learned about the importance of advocacy in 2013 when I led the effort to pass a GMO labeling law and most recently while working to ban a toxic pesticide, chlorpyrifos. It is empowering to learn about the impact of using our voice, but I also learned that our voice is only powerful if there are state legislators willing to hear us. Cristin McCarthy Vahey not only hears us, but takes action to ensure that our ideas, our passions and our concerns are heard above the noise in Hartford. Not only has Cristin supported the issues I am advocating for, but I have seen her advocating on education, transportation and fiscal issues.
Cristin has worked diligently to make sure she is in a position to bring our voice to Hartford. She doesn't worry if she is in photos or in press releases because she is too busy doing the work of the people. While you or I may not always agree with Cristin on everything, she always listens to all sides of an issue, which has earned her the utmost respect from Democrats and Republicans alike. Most importantly, Cristin is a partner in Hartford, in a way that few elected officials understand. She knows that our government works best when we the people work with our elected officials to achieve results that serve us, not special interests trying to dictate policy. If you are in Cristin's district, consider yourself incredibly blessed. Whether you are voting in person or by mail, don't miss the opportunity to vote for Cristin, a genuine leader who is motivated by making the world a better place for all of us.

October 27 2020
In September 2015, an RTM candidate (Rep. Mark McDermott) randomly knocked on my door in his first bid for a seat on Fairfield's RTM. We spoke, he discovered that I was a lawyer, had worked in the Justice Department and the White House, and asked whether I would consider running for a seat on the RTM with him. To say that my last five years as an accidental politician has been an interesting and enlightening ride is putting it mildly. I have worked with people on both sides of the aisle whom I deeply respect; people who have shown an unyielding commitment to Fairfield and who lead with compassion and respect. Of all of the people whom I have had the privilege to meet through my public service, Representative Cristin McCarthy Vahey best exemplifies what I think we need most at this divisive and unstable time: she leads with love; she does not give in to rank partisanship but instead assesses all issues deliberatively and rationally; and even in the face of nastiness, she maintains a level of civility and decency that is unmatched by any other person.
Cristin has served Fairfield with integrity for nearly 15 years, first at the local level for 9 years and then as a State Representative for nearly 6 years. Her experience and knowledge is an asset to the town. She knows our problems and our great possibilities and potential, and fights for us. Unlike her challenger whom I have never seen at a meeting or on public discussion boards until announcing her candidacy, Cristin has a deep involvement in our community. She has fought for our schools, our childrens' health and privacy, and our infrastructure.
Anyone who knows Cristin has heard her say, ""It's important to keep all channels of communication open."" She refuses to write people off because of their political affiliation or their ideology. Instead, she uses debate to interrogate her own views and consequently, makes informed and vetted decisions. Profoundly process oriented, she lets deliberation guide outcomes, not what she personally decides is right.
We need that sort of objectivity right now. I distrust so much around me these days. Cristin gives me such a tremendous sense of security. She makes government better. In voting for Cristin McCarthy Vahey, you vote for one of our ""better angels"" who puts reason ahead of partisanship and fights for every single one of her constituents.

October 27 2020
Greetings,
I would like to voice my support for Brian Farnen for State Representative in the 132nd House District.
This year has been full of polarizing politics and political discourse. I find myself looking for candidates that have a genuine love of our community and state, working to make their small part of the world a better place. No one epitomizes that better than Brian Farnen.
No, I am not of the same political party as Brian but I strongly believe that you should always vote for the best person, not a party.
Brian Farnen has been working hard on behalf of Fairfield from day one. Since COVID, he has been in constant communication, giving us the latest up-to-date information on the virus, working each weekend at food drives for in-need families, and making sure our local community remains safe.
No political agendas or slogans just doing what's right. That is why I support Brain Farnen for State Representative in 2020.
Sincerely,
Leigh Hannum

October 27 2020
To the Editor:
During this election season people will be focused on the national race, but now more than ever we need to pay attention to the people we are choosing to send to Hartford.
The Democrats in the state continue to use the diversion tactic of blaming the president for Connecticut's troubles. The reality is it is the democratic majority in our state legislature that is responsible for the sad state of affairs in Connecticut. They rubber stamped Dan Malloy's directives and continue to do so with Ned Lamont. It is why our taxes keep going up and why our state is in a state of disrepair both fiscally and physically.
One party rule is never a good thing and until the stranglehold the Democrats have in Hartford is removed there will continue to be no conversation with the Republican legislators. Without conversation there can be no bipartisan solutions, no compromise, no way out of the hole we are in. Connecticut needs to keep the Republicans we have in Hartford and vote out the Democrats who are nothing more than another guaranteed ""yes"" vote for the governor. Please vote to re-elect Laura Devlin in the 134th, Brian Farnen in the 132nd, and Tony Hwang for the 28th senate district and let's get a real voice for the constituents in the 133rd by electing Joanne Csonka-Romano. Cristin McCarthy Vahey has chosen to vote with her party instead of representing the best interests of Fairfield. She voted for a budget that cut our school funding and recently turned her back on our Police. Time for a change.

Back to School: Lessons in Reality
""Back to School!"" is the traditional Fall rallying cry for teachers, students and parents. But this year, things are different. Very different.
As a teacher, I have been ""up close and personal"" with this very strange COVID environment we have all been forced to navigate.
And the upheavals don't just revolve around me going back to work. Our 3-year-old daughter, Hunter, started preK-3 this month; something that would have been a huge transition for both of us without the added confusions caused by this virus.
Further complicating things – as if we needed more complications – we worry about taking the proper precautions so that we don't bring COVID-19 back into the house and inadvertently infect my compromised 74-year-old Dad who lives with us.
Attempting to cope with all this, I have fallen back on three ""tried and true"" principles that I announce to my art class students at the beginning of each semester.
""Be creative,"" I tell them. Don't get stuck thinking you have no talent for this. Open your mind and your heart to any possibility that occurs to you and then go for it!
""Have some patience."" You're not going to be brilliant from Day One. Developing any new skill set takes time and practice.
""Kindness is king!"" This is true not only in relation to other people, but also in relation to yourself. Be sure to 'cut yourself some slack' when it comes to how you thought it was going to turn out versus the actual final result.
Taking my own preaching to heart, I have been trying to be as creative, patient and kind as I can with the changes in my school, in my relationships with students and parents, and in relation to all of the new complications that have arisen in our home.
I'm realizing that practicing these three virtues is not as easy as I make it sound when I'm talking to 12-year-olds, but it has clearly been helping me – and all of those around me – when I can keep them in the forefront of my mind and then actually put them into practice.
Be kind. Be patient. And be creative!
One way or another, we WILL get through this!

As a former policy analyst at the state Department of Education, Jenn has the perfect background to advocate for our children in Hartford. Her focus on data-driven solutions to problems is exactly the type of approach we need in Hartford now more than ever.

The meeting will take place 7 p.m. Tuesday, ahead of the board's regular meeting at 8 p.m. Members of the public must register in advance to participate via teleconference. The school board has not heard spoken public comment since the coronavirus pandemic spread to Connecticut in March, forcing elected government bodies to meet remotely as a precaution against virus transmission.
""Public comment is right now a work in progress,"" board Secretary Jessica Gerber said in an email.
Prior to the board's recent decision to hold the special meeting, officials had been exploring the logistics of offering a live, call-in option for residents, according to Gerber.
Board of Education members and Fairfield residents alike have been vocal about their desire to resume full-time, in-person learning. Last month, a letter signed by more than 300 Fairfield families was submitted to school officials requesting an immediate return to full-time classroom education. An online petition in August seeking an in-person, full-time learning option received nearly 800 signatures.
Fairfield elementary students were set to go back to the classroom full-time in November, until the town was added last week to the state's ""red alert"" zone for coronavirus infections, leading the district to postpone the plan and continue its hybrid learning model.
Since the pandemic reached Connecticut, the school board has been taking public comment solely via email, as has the Board of Selectmen and the Board of Finance. The finance board hopes to resume in-person meetings by the end of the year, and in doing so, accommodate spoken public comment, according to Chair James Brown.
The Representative Town Meeting has plans to soon allow live public comment during its meetings, according to Moderator Karen Wackerman. The Town Plan and Zoning Commission accepts public comment in the form of emails or hard copy correspondence, as well as spoken comments during its public hearings, held over Webex, Chair Matthew Wagner said in an email.

I'm writing wholeheartedly and enthusiastically in support of state Rep. Laura Devlin, a respectful, intelligent, tireless and hard-working leader in Hartford. She was instrumental in educating CT residents all over the state about the complex facts regarding the tolls issue and the Special Transportation Fund. I attended her very first informational forum, after I had done my own research first on this issue. She was factual and made everyone feel comfortable, no matter what side of the issue they were on, and didn't end the meeting until everyone's questions were answered. She tirelessly held at least 20 meetings around the entire state in the evening after already putting in a full day of work.
We get federal funding for not having tolls as part of a special agreement from the Stratford toll accident many years ago.
We pay one of the highest gas taxes in the country, which is supposed to go towards the transportation fund. $1 billion of this has been diverted for other spending during the last 20 years.
Numerous expenses were tossed into the transportation fund, including pensions. They should no longer be included in this fund and it should be used entirely for our infrastructure needs.
It's a very complex issue and nobody should be adding yet another tax onto CT residents, especially a tax for driving to work as many cannot afford it. CT is the second-highest taxed state in the country, yet we rank 48th in fiscal solvency. That screams mismanagement of our tax dollars.
Recently, that four-letter word, toll, has emerged again. Many current legislators and candidates are pro tolls for cars and trucks, including Cristin McCarthy Vahey, Jennifer Leeper, Michelle McCabe and Carla Volpe. Please remember Connecticut this election!

Jessica Giles, 37, of West Haven, waived her right to be indicted and pleaded guilty Tuesday to theft of mail by a postal employee, according to a news release from the Justice Department.
Between October 2019 and May 2020, Giles used a flashlight to examine envelopes in the mail, the news release said. When she found an envelope she believed to contain cash, she would open it, steal the money and tear up the envelope, according to the news release, which said Giles was recorded on video surveillance committing the offenses.
Giles, who is released pending sentencing, is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 4, the news release said. She faces a maximum of five years in prison.

Tuesday was another big night for Democrats across Connecticut as they increased their majority in the General Assembly and swept all five congressional districts.
So how did Trump's support in Fairfield compare with his vote totals in 2016, when he was running against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?
According to the Fairfield registrars of voters, Trump earned 12,048 votes in 2020 and in 2016 he secured 12,112 votes. In 2020, Joe Biden received 22,859 votes in Fairfield and in 2016 Clinton received 18,041 votes.
Trump's vote totals were very consistent from 2016 to 2020, but Biden secured nearly 5,000 more votes than Clinton did in Fairfield.
For the entire state of Connecticut, Biden received 974,279 votes compared to Trump's 682,562 in 2020. In 2016, Clinton received 897,572 votes and Trump received 673,215 votes.

McCabe is the director of the Center for Food Equity and Economic Development with the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport.

Many voters have cast absentee ballots weeks in advance due to the coronavirus pandemic.
All eyes are on the White House race between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden. Neither Connecticut U.S. Senate seat is up for re-election in this cycle, but all five congressional seats are. All of Connecticut's state Senate and House of Representative seats are up for election too.
Democrats hold majorities in both the state House and Senate. There are 22 Democratic legislators and 14 Republicans in the Senate and 91 Democrats to 60 Republicans in the House.

Brian Farnen, a Republican, has conceded to Democrat challenger Jennifer Leeper in the race for the 132nd House District.
Preliminary, unofficial numbers Tuesday from the Fairfield registrars of voters showed Farnen behind by 269 votes.
""We're really disappointed in the results,"" said Farnen, who noted he believed the presidential race had an impact on the outcome of the local contest. ""We worked really hard, and we couldn't overcome the national issues. ... I wish Jennifer best wishes in moving our community forward over the next two years.""
UPDATED 10:30 pm. Tuesday: Incumbent state Reps. Laura Devlin and Cristin McCarthy Vahey have taken substantive leads as preliminary vote totals come in.
McCarthy Vahey, a Democrat representing the 133rd House District, had 7,696 votes, while Republican challenger Joanne Romano-Csonka had 4,160 votes, according to unofficial numbers provided by Fairfield Democratic Town Committee Chair Steven Sheinberg.
""I am so, so humbled and just grateful for the opportunity to continue to serve the people of Fairfield,"" McCarthy Vahey said. ""I love our town so much and I know that there are some real difficulties ahead, and I'm grateful to be a social worker and be a mom and take those perspectives back to Hartford with me.""
Devlin, a Republican serving the 134th House District, had 6,435 votes across the district, according to Sheinberg. The 134th District includes parts of Fairfield and Trumbull. Her opponent, Democrat Carla Volpe, had 5,196 votes.

According to preliminary data provided by Sheinberg, Leeper leads incumbent state Rep. Brian Farnen with 7,536 votes to Farnen's 7,267.
The 132nd District is a former Republican stronghold and its House seat was held by Fairfield First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick, before she was elected to lead the town in 2019. Tuesday's race between Leeper and Farnen is a rematch after Farnen claimed a narrow victory in a January special election.
UPDATED 9:46 p.m. Tuesday: With preliminary data available for three of the four polling places in the 133rd House District, state Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, a Democrat, has taken a significant lead over her challenger, Joanne Romano-Csonka, a Republican.

FAIRFIELD, CT — The polls have closed, the votes are being counted, and every General Assembly seat in Fairfield is up for grabs.
President Trump isn't the only incumbent facing a challenger tonight. Locally, the offices held by state Sen. Tony Hwang, and state Reps. Brian Farnen, Cristin McCarthy Vahey and Laura Devlin are all contested.
(The votes are currently being counted, so continue to refresh this article for updates as the night progresses. To sign up for free real-time election updates from Patch, click here.)
Hwang, a Republican who has held the 28th Senatorial District seat for five years, campaigned to keep the office against Democrat Michelle McCabe, a member of the Fairfield Public Library Board of Trustees and the director of the Center for Food Equity and Economic Development with the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport.
In a Patch candidate questionnaire, Hwang emphasized his 15 years of experience as a state and local elected official, and prioritized local control and input, particularly in the context of the coronavirus pandemic response as well as housing, land use and zoning processes.
""I have always demonstrated my independence and have done my best to represent the interests of our communities,"" he said.
Stay on top of all the returns from across Connecticut and our five congressional districts by checking these stories throughout the night.
In her questionnaire responses, McCabe focused on the need for Connecticut to build resiliency in the face of not only the pandemic, but also severe weather events and statewide inequity.
""I bring both innovation and boots-on-the-ground experience solving problems at the community level,"" she said. ""I know how to do more than simply apply a Band-Aid and I know how to bring stakeholders around the table to develop effective solutions.""
Down the ballot, Republican Farnen faces Democrat and Board of Education member Jennifer Leeper in a rematch after he won the 132nd House District by a narrow margin in a January special election to fill the state representative seat vacated by Brenda Kupchick after she was elected first selectwoman of Fairfield.
Democrat McCarthy Vahey, a state representative for the 133rd House District since 2015, is up against Republican Joanne Romano-Csonka, a former member of the Norwalk Common Council who currently sits on the Fairfield Affordable Housing Committee.

While many had a positive experience at the polls, some voters encountered ballot scanners that weren't working.
""Considering the importance of this election, why was there only one scanner?"" Kevin Jennings, who encountered a broken scanner at Fairfield Ludlowe High School, said in a comment on Patch. ""Not a good experience.""
In a Q&A posted Tuesday on the town website, Fairfield's registrars of voters said they were seeing more machine jams than usual due to the large volume of voters and folded ballots.
""We experience these problems every year, and had 3 machines where we had this problem this year, which were resolved in under an hour,"" the post said.
Voter Jake Liebowitz had concerns about crowding at his polling place, and said he was sometimes ""literally shoulder to shoulder"" with other voters in line.
""There were way too many voters in the room at one time,"" he said in a Patch comment. ""… They had voters lined up and wrapped around the auditorium standing too close to the makeshift voting booths waiting to deposit their ballots.""
Joe Schwartz said in a comment on Patch that one of his poll workers appeared to have a runny nose and cough.
""I raised the issue with the moderator who referred me to the Registrar of Voters,"" Schwartz said. ""I also called the Fairfield Health Dept. who said they would send someone to investigate.""
Most voters who shared their experience with Patch reported wait times under an hour, and praised those at the polls for wearing face masks and practicing social distancing.
""I arrived at Sherman School at 5:45 a.m., waited and voted within 40 minutes,"" Tom Moore said in an email to Patch. ""The people waiting to vote were very respectful of distancing, everyone (except one person) wore a mask and the volunteers were very helpful and courteous.""
Jill Bennett said in an email that her mother took advantage of the curbside voting option, while Bennett herself chose to vote in person.
""I voted at 6 a.m. with my 11-year-old daughter in tow,"" Bennett said. ""We arrived at 5:30 to stand in line at Ludlowe High School and had an I Voted sticker on by 6:04 a.m."""

Police were called about 9 a.m. Saturday to the Davis Road home of Board of Finance Vice Chair Chris DeWitt.
Outside the home, they found Republican campaign signs spray-painted with the acronyms ""BLM"" and ""ACAB,"" which stands for ""all cops are bastards."" The words ""f--- Trump"" were written on the driveway in shaving cream, images showed. Shaving cream also covered the mailbox and a vehicle parked in the driveway was egged, according to police.
""We felt like we were targeted,"" DeWitt said Monday, noting the vandals left an anti-Trump message on his driveway even though the only political signs in his yard were for local candidates.
DeWitt was not home at the time of the vandalism, and the car that was damaged belonged to a friend who was house sitting, he said.
DeWitt's son is president of the Warde Young Republicans Club, and DeWitt said he was impressed when the leaders of the high school's Young Democrats Club reached out to both of his children and offered to help with the cleanup.
""They're really promoting bipartisanship,"" he said, noting he had not been contacted by anyone from the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee.
The committee published a Facebook post Saturday addressing the vandalism.
""Regardless of our political beliefs, we are all Fairfielders,"" the post said. ""We are one community and must behave as such. Let's do better, Fairfield.""
The Democratic and Republican town committees said the vandalism was likely committed by juveniles.
""Our community deserves better and we ask parents to speak to their children about this type of behavior,"" the Fairfield Republican Town Committee said in a Facebook post Saturday.
Police continue to investigate the vandalism.
""The Fairfield Police Department understands that this incident has caused concern to those living within our community,"" Lt. Antonio Granata said in an email Sunday. ""We are working diligently to identify the person(s) responsible for this incident.""
In the meantime, DeWitt said he has replaced the signs that were defaced with new ones.
""We're undeterred by this vandalism,"" he said. ""We're going to support our candidates, we're going to do it up front and open, unlike the people who vandalized our property."""

Originally scheduled to be filmed in-person Oct. 23, the League of Women Voters of Fairfield moved the debate online and instead held it Oct. 26 — just over a week before the Nov. 3 election — after two participants were potentially exposed to the coronavirus.
Candidates for the 28th Senatorial District, 133rd House District and 134th House District faced off in brief, one-on-one debates.
There was no debate for the 132nd House District. Due to a family health issue, Republican state Rep. Brian Farnen was unable to take on Democrat challenger Jennifer Leeper.
Each pair in attendance was asked about the pandemic in some capacity.
""We can no longer look at tax and spend as a continuum of putting pressure on people who are struggling already,"" state Sen. Tony Hwang, a Republican, said in response to a question about how to compensate for declining revenue and rising expenses as a result of the virus.
Hwang's opponent, Democrat Michelle McCabe, in her response noted the influx of people moving to Connecticut.
""Our tax revenues are up at this moment in time,"" she said, adding the state should be considering how best to invest in residents and businesses moving forward.
When asked how the government should support those who have lost jobs as a result of the pandemic, state Rep. Laura Devlin, a Republican representing the 134th House District, called for a business-friendly approach, and noted mortgage relief and rent assistance are available. Democrat challenger Carla Volpe advocated for health care accessibility and job training programs.
In response to a question about how she would make decisions about the virus after the governor's executive orders expire, Democrat state Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, of the 133rd House District, prioritized reliance on health experts. Her opponent, Joanne Romano-Csonka, a Republican, said she would consider how to protect children, the elderly and first responders from the virus.
""We have to be very careful of opening up places and not wearing masks,"" Romano-Csonka said.
When asked about the police accountability bill passed over the summer, McCabe called it ""an important first step,"" while Hwang said it was ""rushed through,"" adding that the public safety committee on which he sits never saw the legislation.
McCarthy Vahey referred to a ""false choice"" between wanting greater equity and supporting the police when she answered a question about how to address issues illuminated by the Black Lives Matter movement.
""Our country has really cried out for a new kind of conversation and really a new way of doing things and new levels of accountability,"" she said, adding she supported curriculum changes requiring Black and Puerto Rican studies in schools.
Romano-Csonka spoke in favor of implementing education programs that address discrimination and teach young people about the importance of equality.
When asked about state infrastructure, the Republican candidates criticized the use of transportation funds for projects that were not related to transportation, and backed the use of federal money — instead of tolls — to pay for transportation needs, a sentiment the Democrat candidates did not always share.
""We need to explore tolling as a solution,"" McCabe said.
McCarthy Vahey voiced support for investment in broadband and electric transportation, while Volpe prioritized improving Interstates 95, 91 and 84."

November 1 2020
I have had the opportunity to work on Senator Hwang's re-election campaigns twice now, back during the 2018 race and during this current election cycle, and the main theme of both campaigns is authenticity. Tony Hwang is someone who genuinely cares about the communities he represents and actively works to display that devotion to the people who have trusted him as their State Senator. As of right now, the campaign has made many calls to residents, but those calls have only been to respond to the needs of people during this coronavirus pandemic to see how Tony can help them. Whenever Tony is talking to a constituent, he is fully focused on listening to what they have to say so that he can be a better legislator and maintain his connection to the community. Furthermore, whenever someone has said that they do need aid, Tony has made it a point to respond to these people quickly and get them the help they need. Decisive steps forward to improve the community seems to be the senator's personal creed and this is what made me want to come back to work on his campaign a second time.
The first time I worked on one of Tony's campaigns I was just a college freshman with very little experience working in politics, but I remember meeting Tony and feeling immediately welcomed into the group. He was thankful that I was there and devoted part of his time to listen to why I decided to get involved in politics. That is what makes Tony a unique official: he takes an interest. He understands that there is always more to learn about his community so that he can better represent them, and he knows that there is always more to learn about people so he can work and serve them more effectively. Tony Hwang is a person who is involved in politics to improve his state and local community. But what makes him a great State Senator, is that he is eager and willing to solve issues through personal actions that will help the community in the present. Anything less wouldn't be Tony.

We Need More Teachers in Hartford
Connecticut has a broken education system, and we need someone who has seen the system from the inside to be able to fix it. There are serious problems in Connecticut surrounding the widening achievement gap between low- and high-income families.

Carla Volpe, the Democratic candidate for Fairfield and Trumbull's 134th district, is a teacher in Connecticut, and she's seen firsthand the problems plaguing the system. We need teachers in Hartford to solve this crisis, and she's the teacher for the job.

The education crisis in Connecticut is deepening. In a 2018 lawsuit, parents, teachers, and school boards alleged that state lawmakers have a responsibility to not only fix the problem, but also to guarantee equal learning for all students regardless of socioeconomic status. Connecticut has one of the worst achievement gaps in the country, with lower-income school districts in Bridgeport and Hartford having only a quarter of the students reading at grade level, with half of the students significantly behind. This is an issue that is not to be taken lightly. It involves the future of the state and the country.

We need more teachers in Hartford crafting education policy because the politicians of the past so clearly failed us. If we are going to be able to guarantee equality in the education system in this state regardless of socioeconomic status, we need someone to fight based on what works, instead of what looks good on a campaign flyer. We need someone who will be able to use their background in education in order to fix the issues in our flawed system.

Carla Volpe is that person and we know that she will fight for what is right, and she will fight for equality in education.

Education is fundamental. It provides a platform for understanding and attacking problems for individuals and families, and for building a dynamic economy. No news there. And no news, too, that education in Connecticut has fundamental issues needing fundamental responses. Today, our government officials who plan policy, can't simply continue to react to every emergency that comes their way as it comes their way—whether a pandemic or disturbing study results. We need someone with experience in planning ahead and developing policies not only for the present but the future as well.
Michelle McCabe has the skills for and experience in tackling some of the biggest economic challenges facing the people of Connecticut, honed by working with Connecticut communities. These inspire her vision for Connecticut: building a better future for our state. Michelle has the ability to devise dynamic plans and policies to address the gap in educational advancement caused by the pandemic and to invest in our ability to respond to future emergencies. She's tackled problems like these before. Michelle knows how to work with educators to develop robust online learning options that work both for students and teachers. She's done it before. And she's committed to developing a pathway to universal pre-K, one of the most basic building blocks for educational.
We need Michelle McCabe in Hartford. She has a track record for success in attacking community problems at the community level. She has the professional, on-the ground experience that will help drive the fundamental challenges we face in Connecticut, rather than complacently accept the same-old/same-old. She has my vote on November 3.

October 31 2020
We have known Tony Hwang for over 15 years. Tony was one of our RTM Representatives when he first got into politics in Fairfield in 2005, and then subsequently our State Representative and State Senator since 2008. During this entire time, Tony has also been our neighbor and our friend, so we can certainly speak for his integrity, decency, and solid moral compass. While we have written letters in past elections in support of Tony and his command of the issues, his legislative successes, his responsive constituent servicing, and constant accessibility – all of which are still of the highest caliber - it's important to also focus on his character. Tony is a truly dedicated family man and a deeply passionate public servant and community leader – someone who not only cares about keeping Connecticut and Fairfield strong, but about the people who live in our community. One of Tony's special gifts is showing a genuine empathy for people. He wants to be there for people and his compassion shows no bounds – as both a state representative and a friend. Tony is visible everywhere in town and thrives on staying engaged with and caring about the people he meets. That is really one of the most important qualities we want in our government representatives – Empathy – something Tony has an abundance of.

December 23, 2020
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays Fairfielders!
""This week's update has a great deal of information and I also included a reflection of accomplishments by our town departments despite the challenges faced in 2020. I hope you will take a few moments to read through the information and resources provided.
I want to start by first thanking you, our residents, for sharing your kindness through emails, calls and gestures over this past year. Your support and encouragement has been a real blessing to me. I'm looking forward to a new year filled with hope and promise for Fairfield.
COVID-19 UPDATE
Quarantine Guidance: The Connecticut Department of Public Health has developed new quarantine guidance based on the CDC's recommendations. These recommendations provide options to reduce the quarantine time from the 14-day period to a 10-day period with specific additional criteria, and 7-day quarantine period with a negative test collected day 5, or after an additional criteria. For more information see the CT Department of Public Health Guidanceand the CDC Quarantine Guidance.
While this new recommendation has been made, the State Department of Education has not yet updated the Addendum 5 guidance. Therefore, students will continue to follow the 14-day quarantine before returning to school, until the Addendum is revised.
Vaccine Information: Connecticut has prepared for the authorization and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and is currently in Phase 1a, which is outlined here. According to the CT COVID website, the goal is for all residents of Connecticut to have access to the vaccine, although this will likely not occur until late Spring or early Summer 2021. I am very proud of our Health Department that has worked around the clock to set up a clinic to assist in the vaccination of first responders and health care professionals. Right now the Town is limited to provide vaccinations only to those registered with the state and in the Phase 1a category. We are not able to provide vaccinations to anyone outside those parameters at this time. Once we are allowed to start vaccinating other priority groups, we will let residents know through the Health Department webpage and social media accounts.
Town Data: The Town of Fairfield has had 2,785 cases to date, and 172 of Fairfield residents have sadly lost their lives. Charts and data on Fairfield cases, including daily & weekly changes, age, gender, nursing home statistics, testing results, different trends, and university statistics, can be found at www.fairfieldct.org/covid19data. The Health Department updates this page daily.
The Health Department also updates the COVID-19 School Data page, which details the school-related metrics and is updated each week as the State releases the data. The Fairfield Board of Education also has a dashboard on their homepage at https://www.fairfieldschools.org.
Both Fairfield and Sacred Heart Universities published dashboards with their daily testing information, which can be found here:

CHRISTMAS EVE STORM:
Weather forecasts are showing high winds and heavy rains Christmas Eve into Christmas morning. While the forecasts are varying, we expect wind gusts between 45-65 mph, and UI is anticipating power outages. Click here to read more information on storm preparedness.
The number to contact United Illuminating's automated phone line to report power outages is 1-800-722-5584 or you can do so online here. Click here for more information on how to contact the various utility companies.

I want to remind residents in case of possible power outages to charge phones and computers, and put new batteries in flashlights. It also might be a good idea to turn your heat up in advance of the storm. We are expecting colder weather on Saturday.
COMMUNITY NEWS
Tax Deferment: Governor Lamont's recently signed Executive Order No. 9R allows towns to again offer deferment for property tax payments. This past spring the Town of Fairfield approved a tax deferment program (for taxes due April 1st and July 1st) that Governor Lamont authorized in response to the pandemic. The new Executive Order allows towns to offer deferment for taxes due January 1. The extension will be for a total of 90 days, (an additional 60 days beyond the normal grace period). The revised due date is April 1. Anyone who fails to pay by the new April 1 deadline would have to pay three months of interest added along with his or her existing bill. Escrow accounts are still ineligible for deferment. For more information and eligibility for commercial landlords, visit fairfieldct.org/taxcollector. Read the Fairfield Citizen article here.
Town Property Acquisition: In my December 12 update I shared with you the Town's interest in purchasing the property of the former Giant Steps School in order to move the Walter Fitzgerald Alternative High School. This week, all three town bodies approved the $5.1 million for the town to purchase the 12-acre site in Southport at 309 Barberry Road. Read an article in the Patch here. I am excited our alternative high school will have a new and improved home and I believe this is a great investment for the town. I look forward to discussions and community input on how the town can best use this property in the future.
Fairfield in 2020
While this has been a very challenging year and most of us are looking forward to a brand new year, there were some positive highlights in 2020 that I would like to share with our residents. Our Town Departments have worked very hard over the past nine months through the pandemic to keep our town services up and running. While many towns completely closed down and sent employees home, we did all we could to maintain our town operations. Our town employees stepped up and worked through some difficult and stressful circumstances to meet the needs of our residents. I want to thank them for their good work on behalf of our community and share with you some of their accomplishments.

THANK YOU:
I never thought in my wildest dreams when I won election last year that I would lead the Town of Fairfield during a global pandemic. I have heavily relied upon the guidance and advice of the Emergency Management Team, who I have consistently worked with since March. I want to take a moment to recognize two individuals who have really gone above and beyond in their service to our Town: Health Director, Sands Cleary and Emergency Management Director & Fire Chief, Denis McCarthy. Their professionalism, leadership and commitment to our community is truly remarkable. I am grateful for their support and dedication during this very challenging year and want our residents to know how blessed we all are to have such consummate professionals serving our community throughout this public health emergency.
HOLIDAY CHEER: I want to thank the Fairfield Police Department for spreading joy last weekend through their annual Toy Drive. What a wonderful sight to see!
The Fairfield Holiday Light Tour allows residents to view the best and brightest holiday displays around town. Be sure to check out the tour here. All of their proceeds will be donated to the Tommy Fund for Childhood Cancer. Thank you to the Fairfield Fire Fighters Charitable Foundation and the Parks & Recreation Department for organizing this wonderful activity for families.
Our town has not been able to gather together to enjoy the holiday season, most especially to attend our school's holiday concerts. I hope you will enjoy this virtual Carillon 2020 Warde High School shared with me featuring our young and talented performers.
I hope you have found my weekly newsletters to be helpful and informative. This is the last newsletter of 2020 and I look forward to sharing town updates with you again in 2021. I hope you have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy & Healthy New Year.""

WINTER WEATHER
Per Town ordinance, Fairfield property owners are responsible for removing snow and ice from the sidewalk along their property line within 24 hours after the storm and keeping the sidewalk clear of snow and ice. Heavily used sidewalks near schools and public buildings, and the commercial areas are particularly important. Property owners may be fined and/or charged the cost of removal if the property owners do not comply. Please remember to shovel around fire hydrants.
If you have snow removal concerns or would like to request a street be re-plowed, please enter a Citizen Service Request and select 'Snow Removal Issues' or call the Town Garage at 203-256-3177. For more information on Fairfield plowing and snow removal policies, click here.
It is also state law in Connecticut to remove snow and ice from your vehicle before driving on roads. When you fail to remove snow and ice from your vehicle you are putting yourself and others at risk. Penalties can be as much as $120 fine.
FAIRFIELD SOCIAL SERVICES HOLIDAY GIVING PROGRAM
On behalf of the families that receive the support from the Holiday Giving Program, the Town of Fairfield and Department of Human and Social Services would like to thank the community for keeping all our residents in mind for the upcoming holiday season.

FAIRFIELD REVALUATION
For the past few months, I have included information in my newsletter about the revaluation taking place in Town to make sure residents are aware that the Connecticut General Statutes require each town to do a revaluation every five years. Following the appropriate RFP process, the Board of Selectman voted to hire a revaluation company to conduct the revaluation.
The revaluation analyzes all sales in Fairfield between October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2020 and will correspond to the tax bills that will be due beginning in July of 2021. The Town does not play a role or have any authority regarding how a revaluation is conducted.
I have received some feedback from residents who are concerned about their specific valuations. I would like to note that the revaluation company, Municipal Valuations, is available for informal hearings with residents by appointment through January 8th. Information on scheduling an informal appeal can be found here. The valuation information found on our website, https://gis.vgsi.com/fairfieldct/ is updated with the information you received in the mail.
If you miss the informal hearings, the next step is a formal public hearing before the Board of Assessment Appeals in March. To listen to the presentation from Municipal Valuations and the Town Assessor from the December 7th Board of Selectman meeting that provides more information on the methodology of the revaluation, please click here. You can also check fairfieldct.org/taxassessor for updates.
HOLIDAY SHOPPING - BUY LOCAL!
If you haven't finished your holiday shopping, a perfect way to get through your list is to purchase e-gift cards for family and friends through our Chamber's ""Love Local"" program. It's super easy, and a lovely gift that allows family and friends to use at a long list of Fairfield businesses. I hope you'll join me in supporting our businesses while giving fun and safe gifts for the holidays. Find out more here. And the Town also has a Virtual Holiday Gift Guide for Fairfield you can view here.

COVID-19 TESTING
Testing capacity has increased in our area. To view locations where to get tested, please visit fairfieldct.org/covid19testing.
Contact Tracing
One of the key tools we have to contain the spread of COVID-19 is Contact Tracing. For this initiative to be successful, the Health Department needs the cooperation of residents who test positive for COVID-19. Both Universities were trained and assisted by our Health Department to manage their own contact tracing for their respective campuses.
The primary purpose of contact tracing is to identify and notify direct contacts of confirmed cases as quickly as possible and to ensure those exposed are self-quarantining. The information provided in the interviews with confirmed cases helps reduce the potential spread of the virus in our community.
Any Fairfield resident who tests positive for COVID-19 and has not received a phone call from the Fairfield Health Department or the Connecticut COVID Tracing system within 24 hours of receiving their result is urged to contact the Fairfield Health Department at 203-256-3022. Calls received after hours or on weekends, will be returned by the next business day.

December 22, 2020
Governor Lamont's recently signed Executive Order No. 9R allows towns to again offer deferment for property tax payments. This past spring the Town of Fairfield approved a tax deferment program (for taxes due April 1st and July 1st) that Governor Lamont authorized in response to the pandemic. The new Executive Order allows towns to offer deferment for taxes due January 1. The extension will be for a total of 90 days, (an additional 60 days beyond the normal grace period).

117,/connecticut/fairfield/5-1-million-approved-fairfield-buy-12-acre-southport-site,2020-12-22T10:12:32Z,$5.1 Million Approved For Fairfield To Buy 12...,1,6,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — Fairfield's plan to buy a 12-acre property in Southport is moving forward, as three town bodies voted Monday to set aside more than $5 million for the purchase and initial site improvements.
The property at 309 Barberry Road was formerly home to Giant Steps School. The town intends to turn it into the new location of the Water Fitzgerald Campus alternative high school, although much of the site would remain available for a range of other possible uses.
The Board of Selectmen, Board of Finance and Representative Town Meeting all approved the issuance of $5.1 million in 20-year bonds to fund the endeavor.
""I think the price is just right for almost 12 acres right in the heart of Southport,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said to town meeting members when the body's joint committee discussed the purchase Thursday.
Giant Steps was a school for people with learning and developmental disorders that operated for nearly 30 years before it was shuttered over the summer, with officials citing difficulties related to the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the closure.
The property includes the roughly 18,000-square-foot building where Giant Steps was located, which will become Walter Fitzgerald's new facility, as well as a second structure that is nearly 24,000 square feet but has been vacant for decades.
The town may knock down the long-empty building or reconstruct its roof, Kupchick said. The structure could be used for public works, education and summer camps, or it could be turned into a field, according to Kupchick. If the town demolishes the existing structure, it could be replaced with ""quite a sizable building"" without the town infringing on the property setbacks, according to Angelus Papageorge, executive director of operations for Fairfield Public Schools.
A few town meeting members expressed concern about traffic and costs associated with Fairfield's acquisition of the property, but Kupchick and town attorney Jim Baldwin were adamant that any ideas for town use of the site were speculative and would be priced out in advance.
""The future use of the other part of the property is to be determined and fully vetted by town bodies,"" Baldwin said.
The Walter Fitzgerald Campus is currently located in a building at 108 Biro St., which is owned by the Diocese of Bridgeport, costs the Fairfield school district $110,250 per year in rent, and is in need of extensive maintenance. The diocese plans to sell the Biro Street facility and does not intend to invest in it further.
""It would have cost us more than this to purchase the property that alternative high school is on right now,"" Kupchick told the town meeting, after referring to the Giant Steps site as a ""turnkey operation."" ""This is a much better acquisition and a much more cost-effective acquisition.""
Officials hope to buy the property and complete any needed improvements by the end of summer 2021, in time for the new school year."
118,/connecticut/fairfield/january-taxes-will-be-accepted-late-april-fairfield,2020-12-22T02:00:50Z,January Taxes Will Be Accepted As Late As April...,2,0,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — The governor recently signed an executive order allowing towns to once again defer property tax payments — an opportunity Fairfield intends to take advantage of on behalf of its residents.
In the spring, Fairfield approved a deferment program for taxes due April 1 and July 1 that was authorized by Gov. Ned Lamont in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The new executive order allows towns to offer deferment for taxes due Jan. 1.
""The pandemic has created many challenges for residents, and I am grateful the governor again provided this option for towns so we in turn can provide relief to residents,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said in a town news release.
The extension will be for 90 days. Anyone who fails to pay by April 1 will have to pay three months' interest along with the existing bill. Escrow accounts will be ineligible for deferment.
""Because the executive order was granted so late, there was not enough time to include notice about the grace period in the bills to residents, however, we are working to send out a post card, and are doing all we can to get notice out on social media, via news outlets and the town website,"" Tax Collector Dave Kluczwski said in the news release.
No approvals are needed from any other town bodies to implement the tax deferment program as long as the town is doing the same tax break program that was authorized earlier in the year, according to the executive order.
About $10 million was deferred during the last program, Kluczwski estimated, but the deferred payments were ultimately received within three months, based on Kluczwski 's analysis of overall tax collections.
Seventy-one percent of towns opted for the deferment over a low-interest program earlier in the year. The last deferment and the new deferment do not address the sewer and real estate taxes that were due Oct. 1. They are not eligible for deferment, interest is still charged and interest paid cannot be refunded or transferred.

The body signed off, with 21 in favor and 19 opposed, to fund agreements for the voluntary incentive plan with unions representing the town's public service, and professional and technical employees.
""This is a crucial part to my reorganization plan,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick told the town meeting when its joint committee met Dec. 7.
Fairfield officials expect 23 workers to opt for early retirement. If that happens, the plan will create a $5.9 million liability impact over 20 years, in addition to $400,000 in lump sum payments for retirees. The net budget savings for the plan are estimated at just under $3.2 million over 10 years, although town officials made clear that because the program is voluntary, there is no way to know the exact savings in advance.
""Nothing is guaranteed in this process because there are so many variables,"" Kupchick told the body at its meeting Monday.
Kupchick intends to use the early retirement plan to build a more efficient town government with better customer service, integrated technology and reorganized departments. She has also resolved to eliminate three funded positions, without reducing services.
""I have committed, no matter what, that this will be budget neutral,"" she said Monday.
Town representatives questioned Kupchick both Dec. 7 and Monday about financial aspects of the plan, with Majority Leader Jill Vergara, D-District 7, repeatedly referencing a draft of the town's comprehensive annual financial report. According to Vergara, the document said that as of June 30, 2020, the town's pension plan had dropped year-over-year from 86 percent funded to 78 percent funded.
""Those numbers are concerning, and it reflects serious risk in my mind,"" Vergara said Monday.
Vergara questioned whether the early retirement plan would further exacerbate the funding decline, and at one point introduced Board of Finance member Lori Charlton to the teleconference.
Charlton said the retirement plan would bring the funding level down to 76 percent.
""We had the pension board review this extensively and this never came up,"" Kupchick said.
At the meeting, Chief Finance Officer Jared Schmitt said he did not expect the pension plan's funding level to drop below 81 percent.
In an email Wednesday, Schmitt said the annual report draft cited by Vergara contained no actuarial analysis of assets, an essential component of determining how pensions impact a town budget. Schmitt did not provide Patch with a copy of the draft when the publication requested one Wednesday, on the grounds that the document was not finalized.
Kupchick's administration has committed to fully funding the actuarially defined employer contribution of the pension fund — the amount the town must save annually to ensure the necessary retirement funds are available.
Representative Sharon Pistilli, D-District 3, had multiple concerns about the specifics of the retirement plan, and questioned whether the town's savings calculations accounted for attrition or for the raises new hires who replaced retirees would receive over the years.
""The savings numbers are overestimated,"" Pistilli said Dec. 7.
At the same meeting, representative Karen McCormack, R-District 2, said such statements were ""beyond speculative."" Representative Marisa Ringel, R-District 10, said Monday that other members of the town meeting were ""micromanaging"" the first selectwoman, and urged the body to support the plan.
Kupchick agreed to update the town meeting on her progress in September."

121,/connecticut/fairfield/fairfield-police-making-changes-after-dog-mistakenly-euthanized,2020-12-13T09:54:21Z,Fairfield Police Making Changes After Dog...,3,16,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"FAIRFIELD, CT — Fairfield officials are making changes to police procedures after a family pet was mistaken for a baby coyote last month and euthanized, an incident that resulted in a part-time animal control officer being placed on leave.
First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick and the Fairfield Police Department are in the process of drafting new policies in the wake of the incident, Kupchick said Saturday in her weekly email to residents.
In the interim, senior police officers will accompany animal control officers who are sent out on calls involving wildlife, and animal control staff will undergo additional training.
The incident occurred the evening of Nov. 11, when police and animal control officers responded to a report of a distressed baby coyote on a porch on Lawrence Road, law enforcement said at the time. When state officials told local authorities there were no rehabilitation facilities equipped to help, the animal — who police said appeared to be suffering from exposure — was taken to the town animal shelter.
Once there, it was euthanized with a service weapon, in accordance with department policy for severely ill or injured animals for whom there is no other humane recourse. Officials later learned the animal they thought to be a coyote was actually a 13-year-old Shiba Inu named Kitsu that weighed 15 pounds.
In her Saturday update, Kupchick said she had heard from many residents who were upset by the circumstances of Kitsu's death.
""I vowed to the family who lost their dog that I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again,"" Kupchick said.
Kupchick has been in contact with animal welfare groups and animal control officers from other towns, she said.
Detectives began an investigation after Kitsu died, and a part-time animal control officer was placed on administrative leave pending the investigation's results."

December 12, 2020
Good Afternoon Fairfielders,

""I would like to wish a very Happy Hanukkah to our residents who are celebrating this week. May your lights shine bright and that you safely enjoy celebrating this festive and joyous holiday.
COVID-19 Data
We are continuing to see widespread community transmission of COVID-19 in Fairfield and the State, and the peak is expected to be at the end of December/beginning of January. We are now seeing an impact on case rates from Thanksgiving gatherings. I urge residents to continue to limit interactions to those within your immediate household.
As you have likely read, the vaccines for COVID-19 have been approved and distribution is underway. Healthcare workers, long-term care facilities and medical first-responders will start to see supply in the next few weeks.
It has been widely reported that the CDC has changed quarantine guidance and we have received a lot of questions from residents about why we haven't changed our policies. The State Department of Public health is waiting on final word from the Governor's office before putting out new recommendations. Our Health Department will follow the guidance they set forth and we will share that with you when it is available.
The Town of Fairfield currently has 2,556 cases, and 161 of Fairfield residents have sadly lost their lives. Charts and data on Fairfield cases, including age, gender, nursing home statistics, testing results, different trends, and university statistics, can be found at www.fairfieldct.org/covid19data. When looking at the data page, please be sure to read the notes around each chart as they explain some of the changes in the data. The Health Department updates this page daily.
The Health Department also updates the COVID-19 School Data page, which details the school-related metrics and is updated each week as the State releases the data. The Fairfield Board of Education has a dashboard on their homepage at https://www.fairfieldschools.org.
Both Fairfield and Sacred Heart Universities published dashboards with their daily testing information, which can be found here:

COMMUNITY NEWS
Animal Control: As you may be aware, we had an incident involving a part-time Animal Control Officer (ACO) that mistook a lost dog for a wild coyote. This was devastating for the family who lost their dog and for our community. Many residents have written and called me to express their sadness and concern about how this tragic mistake happened while also asking what the town is doing to prevent this in the future.
I met with the Police Department the very next day to review what transpired, and have continued to meet with law enforcement to update our town's policies regarding wildlife calls. I have also been in contact with animal welfare groups and several ACOs from other towns, that I worked with when I served as co-chair of the Animal Welfare Caucus in the state legislature. We are currently drafting new policies and practices, and I look forward to sharing them with the community as soon as they are completed. In the interim, since the incident happened, I've asked the Chief of Police to ensure that a senior police officer respond to all calls regarding wildlife when an ACO is dispatched. The Police Department has also secured and scheduled additional training for our ACOs.
I reached out to the family and shared my sincere and heartfelt apologies as did our Police Department. I vowed to the family who lost their dog that I will do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.
Giant Steps: The Town is seeking to purchase the property of the former Giant Steps School in order to move the Walter Fitzgerald Alternative High School, which needs to be relocated. The property purchase price is $4.9 million for almost 12 acres of land in Southport and presents many opportunities for the Town, in addition to the school. You can read more from a recent Fairfield Citizen article on the property.
The Board of Selectman will vote on this purchase December 14th, the Board of Finance will vote on the 16th and the Representative Town Meeting will vote on the 17th. Check the town website for meeting agendas which contain information on how to watch the meetings and/or provide public comment. I believe this will be a positive acquisition for our Town, similar to when John Sullivan purchased the property many years ago where the Burr Street School is now located.
Town Government: In my November 6 newsletter, I discussed the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program (VERIP) I have put forth for approval by the Representative Town Meeting. I explained how VERIP will enable us to:
This type of program is commonly utilized in towns and cities with employee union contracts as a way to open up positions, and allow for reorganization. VERIP is the only path that will allow me to efficiently achieve meaningful change to the way town services are delivered. We presented an amended version of the VERIP after getting feedback from many elected officials in town, which enabled us to lower the overall costs for the program.
If the RTM passes the VERIP plan, my administration will report to our residents and to our elected boards, on the progress of this program, including the budgetary savings. After working in Town Hall for the past year as First Selectwoman, I've gained valuable insight on what is needed. I'm excited to offer the RTM the ability to vote on a package that meets the needs of my administration, employees, and taxpayers.
The RTM will vote on this package at their Monday evening meeting. I hope the RTM will vote in favor of helping me reorganize and modernize our town government, which is long overdue.
GRAND REOPENING
Last Friday I joined my friends Greg and Harry French to cut the ribbon on their newly renovated jewelry store. Harry C. Reid has served the people of Fairfield with integrity and top level customer service for over a century. The New Henry C. Reid is spectacular while maintaining the families long legacy of a proud family-run business. I hope residents will pop in to see the space and shop local this holiday season.
GRAND OPENING
Today I joined Bridget and Jason Lesizza to cut the ribbon for their brand
new business, the Reef Shack, which has opened in the old 7/11 building on Reef Road. It is so encouraging to welcome a new business to town, especially during this challenging year. I hope you will welcome this new addition to our community with your patronage. I can say from experience, the food is fantastic! Read this week's CT Post article on the new eatery here. Thank you to the Fairfield Chamber for organizing the ribbon cutting to celebrate this occasion.
I will continue to communicate directly to you, our taxpayers and residents, every week, with the work I'm doing, the state of our town, and the initiatives I am working on your behalf. As always, I will continue to listen and learn and lead on issues that our community values.

FAIRFIELD REVALUATION
For the past few weeks, I have included information in this weekly newsletter about the revaluation taking place in Town. The Connecticut General Statutes requires each town to do a revaluation every five years. This revaluation analyzes all sales in Fairfield between October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2020 and will correspond to the tax bills that will be due beginning in July of 2021.
Revaluation notices are in the mail and you should expect to receive them next week. The notices will indicate the prior assessed valuation from the 2015 revaluation and the new proposed assessed value from the 2020 revaluation. The value provided to you will be the total assessed value, which is equal to 70% of the market value. Please do not use the current Mill Rate to estimate your taxes as the Mill Rate may change based on the final overall Grand List and the town budget.
Should you have questions concerning your revaluation, the letter will provide instructions on how to schedule an informal hearing with the revaluation company, Municipal Valuations. The valuation information found on our website, https://gis.vgsi.com/fairfieldct/ is scheduled to be updated December 7, 2020.

Contact Tracing
One of the key tools we have to contain the spread of COVID-19 is Contact Tracing. For this initiative to be successful, the Health Department needs the cooperation of residents who test positive for COVID-19. Both Universities were trained and assisted by our Health Department to manage their own contact tracing for their respective campuses.
The primary purpose of contact tracing is to identify and notify direct contacts of confirmed cases as quickly as possible and to ensure those exposed are self-quarantining. The information provided in the interviews with confirmed cases helps reduce the potential spread of the virus in our community.
Any Fairfield resident who tests positive for COVID-19 and has not received a phone call from the Fairfield Health Department or the Connecticut COVID Tracing system within 24 hours of receiving their result is urged to contact the Fairfield Health Department at 203-256-3022.

In response to the recent letter to the editor titled: ""A need for change following fill pile arrests,"" let me say this ...
That happens to be the most ridiculous LTE I have seen to date. Really, this tops the cake. When you look up temerity in the dictionary you will see pictures of those who signed this and were in office when it took place.
Let's start with this shall we?
John Mitola and Sheila Marmion were on the Board of Finance when this took place and in fact Sheila was a selectwoman alongside Mike Tetreau while this was going on.
Jill Vegara has been an RTM member since 2015
Karen Wackerman has been on the RTM since 2015 and when she was a member of the PHS committee on the RTM she didn't support a motion to go to the police to launch a criminal investigation into this matter!
And today both are leaders on the RTM.
Nancy ran alongside Mike as his selectwoman.
All the people listed above campaigned, supported and or endorsed Mike Tetreau for reelection.
This really is audacity at its finest, and now they want transparency? You were the ones minding the store when this took place, and now me, along with the rest of the residents and taxpayers of this town, have to clean up your mess while all of you were asleep at the wheel! You should all do us a favor and resign immediately for negligence of duty!
This is gaslighting at its finest,

We want to thank the Fairfield Town Planning and Zoning Commission for their decision at the special session on Dec. 8 concerning the proposed project at 131 Beach Road. The thought, effort and careful consideration by the commission of all of the evidence that went into modifying and reducing the proposed development was not only impressive, but courageous given the history of legal challenges to 8-30g developments in Connecticut.
Again, we as a neighborhood and a community welcome affordable housing but, as the commission recognized, the proposed building was simply too tall and massive for such a small parcel, and, according to the commission, would have had an adverse effect on the local historic district.
READ MORE: Fairfield Apartment Complex Approved — With Conditions
We also believe, as does the commission, that safety is an important factor for all developments in Fairfield and the requirement to improve ""line of sight"" for the tenants and the general public was very well articulated. Old Post Road Area Association reiterates our stance that surrendering six public parking spaces to improve the line of sight for the development should be denied by the Police Commission. These public parking spaces on Beach Road should not be relinquished as they are required for dozens of special events year round and are also used each day by the Montessori school.
A personal and sincere ""thank you"" to state Sen. Tony Hwang, who spoke at one of the many sessions of the public hearing. Sen. Hwang's passion and concern for Fairfield was clearly evident during his testimony. Beyond making a very passionate plea to the commissioners, Sen. Hwang stayed in regular contact with the neighbors to see if there was anything else he could do. He is a hard working, true representative for our district.
To Commissioner Tom Noonan: Thank you for your comprehensive and detailed presentation on this subject. Clearly your words were well researched, citing case law and precedent. Mr. Noonan, thank you from the Old Post Road Area Association and the neighborhood! Excellent job! Thank you very much for maintaining the integrity of historic Fairfield and the safety of the neighborhood.
To Chairman Matthew Wagner: We understand the burden this posed to you and your commissioners, and we applaud the thoughtful and hard work that went into what was a very difficult decision. We believe you achieved a fair and equitable outcome for the developer, the Town of Fairfield and the historic district.
It was never our intention to prevent the development of a new building on this site. As a neighborhood organization, we simply felt it was too large and would have a negative impact on the abutting neighbor's homes and the surrounding historic area. Again we welcome affordable housing in our neighborhood and look forward to engaging in a dialogue and assisting the developer to achieve that important goal for our community.

In order to move forward, the 40-unit structure planned for 131 Beach Road would need to drop from 62 feet tall to 40 feet tall under the approval granted Tuesday by Fairfield's plan and zoning commission. Zoning officials also required the developer to get clearance from the police commission to remove six on-street parking spaces in order to achieve the necessary 319-foot sight line.
Concerns about traffic safety and the property's proximity to a historic district dominated the zoning commission's discussion.
""It's up to the developer here to come back to us with a revised proposal that mitigates against these hazards,"" Chair Matthew Wagner said.
Chris Smith, attorney for developer 131 Beach Road LLC, did not respond Wednesday to questions about how the project would proceed in light of the new conditions.
The proposed complex was intended to replace the Masonic Temple building at 131 Beach Road, built in 1950 and located on a 0.65-acre site. The planned five-story development would have included 40 apartments, 12 of which were to be rented below market rate, plus 55 parking spaces, with a ground-floor parking structure.
The developer sought approval under state law Section 8-30g, which dictates the only way the commission could have denied the proposal would have been by proving the project posed a threat to public health, safety or ""other matters which the commission may legally consider"" that outweighed the need for affordable housing. Section 8-30g applies to towns where less than 10 percent of housing stock meets state criteria to be recognized as affordable.
Hearings for the project continued for months as residents signed petitions, wrote letters and, in at least two cases, hired attorneys in the fight against the development.
""We took a long time with this for a reason,"" said Commissioner Thomas Noonan, who proposed the conditions, which initially set the maximum height at 36 feet but were later amended to increase the height to 40 feet.
As presented, the project would ""improperly and irreparably"" damage the abutting historic district, Noonan said, arguing the condition that lowered the proposed building's height by more than 20 feet was reasonable and would result in a structure that mirrored other affordable housing developments in town.
""If constructed as proposed this would be one of the tallest buildings contemplated in Fairfield,"" he said.
The developer had argued a shorter maximum height would not be financially feasible, but Noonan said 131 Beach Road LLC provided no evidence to substantiate its case.
""I find it very hard to believe that no reduction in scale is possible,"" Noonan said. ""Other developers have made it work at much lower density.""
The only commissioner to vote against the approval with conditions was Steven Levy, who said the proposal should be granted a maximum height above 40 feet in order to accommodate a fourth story, although he agreed the building as proposed was too tall.
""I think our condition is a little too restrictive,"" he said.
In discussing traffic safety concerns related to the proposal, Wagner referenced a recent crash near the site that injured an employee of local nonprofit Operation Hope so severely she required intensive care.
""There are numerous reports in the record of there being congestion,"" he said.
The complex is projected to generate 218 car trips in or out of the property on a typical weekday.
While the developer's construction application was approved with conditions, a separate proposal for a zoning regulation amendment that would bring the project into compliance with town regulations was unanimously denied. Such compliance is unnecessary for proposals that fall under Section 8-30g."

As elected leaders and Fairfield residents, we are angered and saddened by the recent arrests of former and current town employees on criminal allegations related to the fill-pile scandal originally uncovered in 2019. The alleged criminal activity, abuse of power and negligence is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated; anyone responsible must be held accountable. We appreciate the diligent efforts of law enforcement in investigating these matters. In the wake of this crisis, it is critical that we learn from this terrible failure in our procedures to better understand how to prevent something similar from occurring in the future. We have an opportunity to emerge stronger.
We are fully committed to working with our Republican colleagues and the town administration to not only remediate the injuries to our town lands but also to enact policies and procedures that will protect our town going forward. Both RTM caucuses put forward valuable action steps to address the failures revealed in fall 2019, and we would like to make a renewed call to take a hard look at the town's operations and make the needed structural changes. We urge the administration to identify and address the root causes of the fill pile abuses and institute a culture of accountability and transparency. The solution cannot solely rely on the replacement of individual employees accused of wrong-doing; it must include intentional action plans that address the following:
We urge immediate and ongoing action to address these underlying structural and operational inadequacies so that we can move Fairfield forward and emerge stronger as a community.

A former town contractor accused in the pile contamination crisis discouraged workers from wearing protective equipment out of concern it would alarm the public, police said.
These are just a few examples of how Fairfield employees repeatedly misrepresented the situation surrounding the use of contaminated material in the construction of a berm at the pile, according to affidavits associated with an investigation of pile activity.
Defendants recently charged in the investigation include: Brian Carey, conservation director and interim head of public works; Emmet Hibson, former human resources director; Joe Michelangelo, former public works director; Scott Bartlett, former public works superintendent; and Robert J. Grabarek, an environmental contractor hired by the town.
All five are accused of conspiracy and of illegally disposing of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls — or PCBs — during the 2018 berm project. The affidavits offer a more detailed account of their actions.
Carey was accused of calling police liars, an affidavit said. He is on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and did not respond to a request Friday for comment.
""I heard you were talking to the police,"" Carey said to a subordinate in August or September 2019, according to the affidavit. ""Don't talk to the police. They don't know what they are talking about. They are a bunch of liars.""
Carey went on to tell his employee, ""I can't tell you what to do,"" the affidavit said.
During a Board of Finance meeting in August 2019, Carey admitted the berm was built without state permission but did not disclose that the material used to construct it contained PCBs, according to the affidavit.
""I placed Mr. Carey on administrative leave when I was alerted to the warrant ... signed by a judge for his arrest,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick, elected to lead the town in November 2019, said in an email. ""I'm disheartened this situation was allowed to happen in our town and hope all who participated in any criminal activity will be brought to justice and held to account for their actions.""
Carey, along with Michelangelo and Bartlett, is also charged with illegal disposal of solid waste, receiving solid waste without a permit and an additional conspiracy charge after allowing contaminated material dredged from Owen Fish Pond to be dumped at the fill pile while the berm was being built, according to police.
In February 2020, when a state inspector requested paperwork associated with the dredging, Carey seemed upset and provided the inspector with documents that omitted information about where the dredged material would be disposed, an affidavit said. Carey confirmed to the inspector that there was no record of the disposal location, and said, while walking away, that the material was in the berm, according to the affidavit.
Three years prior, in May 2017, when a finance board member asked if the berm would be made with ""clean material,"" Michelangelo said that it would, according to police.
""Traditionally, arrest warrants are filled with accusations,"" Michelangelo's attorney, Eugene Riccio, said. ""The merits of those accusations ultimately get tested in court.""
An affidavit also contends that when employees involved in the construction of the berm asked contractor Grabarek in April 2018 about protective equipment such as hazmat suits and respirators, he told them the equipment was available but unnecessary and that ""it would just cause concern with the citizens.""
Grabarek did not respond Friday to a request for comment.
The recent charges concerning the berm and Owen Fish Pond are far from the first criminal accusations related to the fill pile.

In summer 2019, Michelangelo, Bartlett and contractor Jason Julian, of Julian Development, were arrested and accused of participating in a conspiracy to illegally run a dump for contaminated material at the pile and allow fraudulent billing, court records have shown.
Also charged is Fairfield's former chief fiscal officer, Bob Mayer, who was arrested in January and accused of stealing a file related to the fill pile and two folders on the Penfield Pavilion building project. Around the same time, Bartlett was charged again, in connection with accusations that he stole thousands of dollars from a mentally disabled woman whose affairs he was appointed to manage.
Fairfield hired Julian Development in 2013 to operate the fill pile and reduce the amount of unused material on the site by 40,000 cubic yards. But over the next three years, the pile tripled in size, and days before the agreement was set to end, contaminants were discovered on the property. Police opened an investigation into activity at the pile in 2017.
In summer 2019, around the same time Bartlett, Julian and Michelangelo were charged, asbestos at a local park was reported to police in connection with the use of town fill. More than 80 areas in Fairfield have since been tested for contamination.
The vast majority of those sites have been deemed safe, but some locations were found to contain asbestos, arsenic and other contaminants, and are undergoing expensive remediation.
Fairfield's town attorney has estimated the remediation cost for the pile and sites affected by its contamination at up to $10 million. The town has already taken steps to set aside well over $3 million for the aftermath of the fill pile scandal and Fairfield is pursuing multiple legal actions to recoup the cost."

The charges, made public by police Friday, were brought against former public works director Joe Michelangelo, who is already accused of environmental and financial crimes associated with the pile.
Michelangelo, who was arrested Friday, joins four other current and former town officials recently charged with illegal disposal of PCBs and conspiracy in connection with the construction of the fill pile berm in 2018, according to police.
Michelangelo's attorney, Eugene Riccio, declined Friday to comment on the new charges.
""I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time,"" he said.
All five officials facing new charges had authorized the use of PCB-contaminated material in the berm's construction, a violation of state law, police said.
The other four defendants are: Brian Carey, conservation director and interim head of public works; Emmet Hibson, former human resources director; Robert J. Grabarek, an environmental contractor hired by the town; and Scott Bartlett, former public works superintendent.
Michelangelo, Carey and Bartlett are also charged with illegal disposal of solid waste, receiving solid waste without a permit and an additional conspiracy charge after they allowed contaminated material dredged from Owen Fish Pond to be dumped at the fill pile while the berm was being built, according to police.
Carey, the only defendant still employed by the town, was placed on administrative leave this week pending an internal investigation.
The cases are being prosecuted by the Office of the Chief State's Attorney's Environmental Crimes Unit. A spokeswoman for the office did not immediately return a call Friday seeking comment.
The five defendants are free on a promise to appear in court Dec. 4.
In summer 2019, Michelangelo, Bartlett and contractor Jason Julian, of Julian Development, were arrested and accused of participating in a conspiracy to illegally run a dump for contaminated material at the fill pile and allow fraudulent billing, court records have shown. All three have pleaded not guilty and requested jury trials.
Michelangelo's charges prior to Friday have included first-degree larceny, second-degree forgery and a variety of environmental crimes including dumping, accepting waste without a permit and illegal disposal of PCBs, according to a document filed by prosecutors in February.
Also charged in connection with the case is Fairfield's former chief fiscal officer, Bob Mayer, who was arrested in January and accused of stealing a file related to the fill pile case and two folders on the Penfield Pavilion building project.
Fairfield hired Julian Development in 2013 to operate the fill pile and reduce the amount of unused project material on the site by 40,000 cubic yards. But over the next three years, the pile more than doubled in size, and days before the agreement was set to end, contaminants were discovered on the property. Police opened an investigation into activity at the pile in 2017.

The vast majority of those sites have been deemed safe, but some locations were found to contain asbestos, arsenic and other contaminants, and are undergoing expensive remediation.
Fairfield's town attorney has estimated the cost of remediation of the pile and sites affected by its contamination at up to $10 million, but because town officials accepted a fraudulent performance bond from Julian Development, Fairfield has no recourse to seek financial restitution, according to police."

New charges were announced Thursday against current and former Fairfield employees, just days after officials approved more than $1 million for remediation and investigation of the pile and sites affected by its contamination.
Those charged include Brian Carey, conservation director and interim head of public works; Emmet Hibson, former human resources director; Robert J. Grabarek, an environmental contractor hired by the town; and Scott Bartlett, the former public works superintendent, who has been arrested three times since summer 2019, according to police.
All four men are charged with illegal disposal of PCBs and conspiracy in connection with the construction of the fill pile berm in 2018, police said. Carey and Bartlett are also accused of illegal disposal of solid waste, receiving solid waste without a permit and an additional conspiracy charge after they allowed contaminated material dredged from Owen Fish Pond to be dumped at the fill pile while the berm was being built, according to police.
Carey, Hibson, Grabarek and Bartlett were all arrested Wednesday or Thursday and released on a promise to appear in court Dec. 4, police said.
Former Fairfield public works director Joe Michelangelo is expected Friday to surrender on new charges, his attorney, Eugene Riccio, confirmed.
Bartlett's attorney, Fred Paoletti, declined to weigh in on the latest charges. Carey, Hibson and Grabarek did not return calls Thursday seeking comment.
The new cases are being prosecuted by the Office of the Chief State's Attorney's Environmental Crimes Unit. Director of Communications Alaine Griffin declined to comment on whether any additional arrests or charges were expected, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.
""We'd like to thank the Office of the Chief's State's Attorney, their staff and their Environmental Crime Unit for their expertise and guidance during this long and difficult investigation."" Fairfield Chief of Police Christopher Lyddy said in a department news release.
The investigation began in 2017, but its origins go back even further.
The charges announced Thursday are far from the first in the fill pile scandal.
In summer 2019, Bartlett, Michelangelo and contractor Jason Julian, of Julian Development, were arrested and accused of participating in a conspiracy to illegally run a dump for contaminated material at the fill pile and allow fraudulent billing, court records have shown. The trio has pleaded not guilty and requested jury trials.
Fairfield hired Julian Development in 2013 to operate the fill pile and reduce the amount of unused project material on the site by 40,000 cubic yards. But over the next three years, the pile more than doubled in size, and days before the agreement was set to end, contaminants were discovered on the property.
After conservation officials said the transportation and dumping of contaminated material could have violated state or federal law, police opened an investigation in 2017.
In addition to the charges against Bartlett, Julian and Michelangelo, Fairfield's former chief fiscal officer, Bob Mayer, was accused in winter 2020 of stealing a file related to the fill pile case and two folders on the Penfield Pavilion building project.
Also during winter 2020, Bartlett was charged in connection with accusations that he stole thousands of dollars from a mentally disabled woman whose affairs he was appointed to manage following the death of her father.
In summer 2019, around the same time Bartlett, Julian and Michelangelo were initially charged, asbestos at a local park was reported to police in connection with the use of town fill. More than 80 areas in Fairfield have since been tested for contamination.
The vast majority of those sites have been deemed safe, but some locations were found to contain asbestos, arsenic and other contaminants, and are undergoing expensive remediation.
Town officials this week began the approval process to issue $1.48 million in bonds to pay for investigation and cleanup at several sites connected to the pile. In 2019, $1.8 million was allocated for pile-related expenses, and in 2017, the town paid $280,000 for an initial remediation, police said.
Fairfield's town attorney has estimated the cost of remediation for the site at up to $10 million, but because town officials accepted a fraudulent performance bond from Julian Development, Fairfield has no recourse to seek financial restitution, according to police.
In May, the town filed a legal complaint against Grabarek's company, Osprey Environmental Engineering LLC, seeking damages and alleging 13 counts, including negligence, breach of contract and ultra-hazardous activities. The lawsuit focused on the company's advice that Fairfield use contaminated material to build a berm at the fill pile without state permission.
A similar case was made by police this week against Carey, Hibson, Grabarek and Bartlett. All four officials authorized the use of PCB-contaminated material in the berm's construction, a violation of state law, police said.
Carey was placed on administrative leave Tuesday, pending an internal investigation by the town into the criminal charges, according to First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick.
That leaves both the conservation and public works departments without a director. Kupchick said she met Thursday with department heads, public works middle managers and conservation staff.
Kupchick has contacted retired public works professionals about serving the town on an interim basis and noted that Doug Novak remains on staff as public works superintendent.
""He's prepared to step up and do whatever's needed,"" she said.
Kupchick also in a prepared statement Thursday pledged to remain accountable to Fairfield residents.
""As I shared with residents when I was sworn in to lead the town of Fairfield, I will continue to do everything within my power to regain the public's faith and trust in our town government, which was damaged in the wake of the fill-pile contamination and public corruption,"" she said."

Brian Carey, conservation director and interim public works director; Emmet Hibson, former town human resources director; and environmental contractor Robert Grabarek are among those newly charged in the case, police said.
Carey has been placed on administrative leave, pending an internal investigation, according to a statement from First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick. Hibson was terminated in January.
Scott Bartlett, the town's former public works superintendent, was arrested Wednesday for the third time since summer 2019, when the first charges were brought in the investigation of corruption and environmental crimes at the town site, according to police. As of this week, Bartlett faces several additional charges.
The charges primarily pertain to the illegal disposal of PCBs in connection with construction in 2017 and 2018 of a berm surrounding the fill pile, police said. The estimated cost to remediate the site is between $5 million and $10 million, according to the town attorney.
Carey and Bartlett are also charged with multiple offenses related to the illegal disposal of solid waste after they authorized contaminated material that was dredged from Owen Fish Pond to be dumped at the pile while the berm was being built, according to police.
Also previously charged in the case are former public works director Joe Michelangelo, whose lawyer confirmed Michelangelo was expected to surrender on new charges Friday, as well as former chief fiscal officer Bob Mayer and contractor Jason Julian.
Carey was named to take over the public works department after Michelangelo's termination in 2019.
Carey, Hibson, Grabarek and Bartlett are all free on a promise to appear and set to go before a judge Dec. 4, police said. Their cases are being prosecuted by the Office of the Chief State's Attorney's Environmental Crimes Unit.

The arrest was Scott Bartlett's third since August 2019, when he and another public works administrator were charged in connection with a contamination and corruption scandal that shocked and angered residents.
Bartlett, the town's longtime superintendent of public works, was charged Wednesday with repeatedly breaking state environmental laws, among them improper disposal of solid waste, according to the Post, which reported Bartlett was released on a promise to appear in court Dec. 4.
An attempt to contact Bartlett's lawyer, Fred Paoletti, was unsuccessful Wednesday evening.
Former Fairfield public works director Joe Michelangelo — already charged with larceny, forgery, conspiracy and environmental crimes — is expected Friday to surrender on new charges, his attorney, Eugene Riccio, confirmed. Riccio declined further comment.
As many as six people — including another former town employee — may face charges in the case, the Post reported, citing sources.
Bartlett, Michelangelo and former town contractor Jason Julian are accused of participating in a conspiracy to illegally operate a dump for contaminated material at the town fill pile and to allow fraudulent billing, court records have shown.
The trio was arrested in August, and has since pleaded not guilty and requested jury trials. Bartlett was also charged in February after he was accused of stealing thousands of dollars from a mentally disabled woman whose affairs he was appointed to manage following the death of her father.

On Thursday, November 12th, three hours before the RTM was scheduled to vote on the First Selectwoman's voluntary early retirement incentive plan (VERIP), the plan was withdrawn from the RTM's agenda. The VERIP, which was presented as a necessary ""investment"" in future modernization and efficiency initiatives, allowed eligible employees to retire early with no early retirement penalty; added 6% onto regular retirees' pensions; and included generous health care enhancements that would have paid or heavily subsidized insurance premiums for periods up to 10 years. The price of these enhanced benefits were estimated to be $340k per employee—on average, a severance package equivalent to 4 years of salary. The total cost (depending on how many employees opted in) was estimated by the town to be $10-19 million. And in exchange for this, the Administration made a commitment to reduce town staffing by only 3 people.

Aside from its steep cost, the VERIP presented untenable long-term financial risk. The VERIP would have added to the Town's unfunded long-term pension and healthcare liabilities—currently a whopping $171 million. The Town's obligation to pay for the enhanced benefits would have impacted our annual budgets for the next 21 years. Further, the total cost would have compounded if annual payments were not budgeted and funded every year—something the Administration would not commit to do. We know how this ""kick the can"" approach led to the State's precarious fiscal position. It would be irresponsible for us to make the same mistake at the town level.

In today's climate of great economic and social uncertainty and loss, the decision to expend $10-19 million on an overly rich deal with the unions is unfair to the taxpayer and is poorly timed. We are facing $11 million in shortfalls from last year's budget. These shortfalls alone represent fiscal cliffs that translate to a 3.79% tax increase. I am proud of the RTM Democrats for averting this expensive golden handshake. We did our job and served as an important check and balance for the people. As a result, fiscal responsibility prevailed. I am hopeful that we can now work together to achieve a retirement deal that meets the needs of the Administration, employees, and taxpayers.

""Looking back on my 38-year career, I have been blessed to work alongside some of the finest individuals this profession has ever produced,"" Lyddy said in a department news release. ""I am the product of many officers and supervisors who came before me and shaped me through the years.""
Lyddy was first introduced to the department in 1976 at age 16, when he joined the Fairfield Police Explorer Program. Three years later, while pursuing a bachelor's degree in criminal justice at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island, he was hired as a special officer in Fairfield to work the summer and holiday seasons.
Lyddy joined the department as a patrolman in 1982, and over the years he rose through the ranks as a detective, sergeant, lieutenant and captain. He was promoted to deputy chief in 2010 before being sworn in as the chief of police in January 2019.
Throughout his career, Lyddy has served in various positions that have helped to bring new and innovative policing approaches to the department. These advancements have included state-of-the-art equipment such as in-car report writing, computer-aided dispatch, a robust records management system, license plate reader technology and automated fingerprint identification systems, according to the department.
""I was impressed with Chief Lyddy's thoughtful approach over the years and have relied on his experience and vast knowledge as first selectwoman over the last year,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said in the news release. ""The town of Fairfield has benefited greatly from Chief Lyddy's professionalism and long dedicated service to our community.""
Lyddy will retire Jan. 22. The department will begin the process of selecting a new chief immediately, and the position is expected to be filled upon the date of Lyddy's retirement.
""I have no doubt that I am leaving the agency in extraordinarily capable hands as the current men and women of the Fairfield Police Department are individually and collectively the best of the best,"" Lyddy said in the news release. ""It has been a sincere honor and privilege to serve this great community with each of our officers."""

Fairfield's Board of Selectmen discussed the changes in value and how they will impact taxpayers at a meeting earlier this month, where they heard a presentation on the town's recent revaluation, a process the state requires towns to conduct every five years to assure the equalization of property valuations.
""I know that people are on edge about this,"" First Selectwoman Brenda Kupchick said. ""It's going to be difficult for our residents who are going up.""
Property owners in neighborhoods where value increased by more than 7 percent should expect a tax increase, according to Michael Fazio of Municipal Valuation Services LLC. Among the 23 neighborhoods included in the town's assessment, eight grew in value by over 7 percent.
Those neighborhoods are: South Pine Creek (up 8 percent), east of North Benson Road (up 9.5 percent), Pine Creek (up 9.7 percent), Sherman (up 10.3 percent), Kings Highway (up 11.3 percent), Tunxis Hill (up 12.3 percent), Reef Road (up 16.2 percent) and Fairfield Beach (up 19.6 percent).
Beach area properties are the most sought after in town, according to Fazio, who said Tunxis Hill and Kings Highway are also ""really hot at this time.""
""The market under $600,000 is a very vibrant, strong market,"" he said.
On the other end of the spectrum, the Sasco Hill, Hoydens Hill, Low Greenfield and Greenfield Hill neighborhoods all dropped in value by more than 10 percent, with Sasco Hill declining the most, at 17.4 percent.
Sasco Hill has historically been overpriced, according to Fazio, who said values in Greenfield Hill ""really got decimated"" after 2015 but have begun to recover in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
Property sales have significantly increased in town year-over-year, with more than twice the number of sales in August, September and October of 2020 compared to each of the same months in 2019, according to a revaluation summary presented to selectmen. During August of 2020, the town had over 150 sales.
Recent average sale prices in Fairfield neighborhoods range from nearly $3 million in Sasco Hill to less than $500,000 in Kings Highway and Tunxis Hill. Between Oct. 1, 2019 and Oct. 1, 2020, there were 978 property sales in town and 847 were residential.
The real estate section of Fairfield's grand list is up 7.5 percent, according to Assessor Ross Murray, who said the town's portion of real estate taxes from commercial and industrial properties increased about 2 percent year-over-year, and was recently more than 11 percent.
""That'll help take some of the burden off the residential taxpayers,"" Selectman Tom Flynn said at the meeting Dec. 7.
Commercial property values grew 27 percent in Fairfield over the course of the five-year revaluation period, with increases in apartments, car dealers and service centers, and medical buildings, according to the summary.
Homeowners received notices about their new assessed value — 70 percent of market value — in early December. Those interested in appealing their assessments can obtain forms to do so in late January from the assessor's office.

137,/connecticut/fairfield/open-letter-fairfield-rtm-member-switches-dem-republican,2020-12-29T21:28:17Z,Open Letter: Fairfield RTM Member Switches From...,4,13,Anna Bybee-Schier,Patch Staff,"Dear Fairfield Democratic leaders,
As you know, I have been disillusioned for some time with the CT Democratic Party's leadership regarding a push for legislation to remove the religious exemption to vaccination mandates in Connecticut.
I feel personally very strongly that the right to informed consent for any medical procedure is a sacred human right, as codified in the Nuremberg Code, and I am opposed to removal of this exemption, as there is no other exemption available in Connecticut, with the exception of medical exemptions, which have become almost impossible to obtain and do not address personal convictions vis-à-vis human and religious rights.
I have observed behavior by CT Democrats in the past that I considered to be disrespectful and dismissive of the concerns of parents and constituents opposed to vaccine mandates (particularly Mr. Tetreau's ugly negative mailing), but I have always felt that there was still a place within the Democratic Party to dissent from what has become a party bias against vaccine rights, as there have always been Democrats who stood for human rights in regard to this issue, and in fact, Robert Kennedy Jr., who is vocal on this issue, is a Democrat.
However, the recent removal on the state level, of the only two Democrats on the Public Health Committee who voted against moving forward HB 59044, the bill to remove religious exemptions to vaccinations in CT, during the 2020 legislative session prior to the COVID epidemic, has convinced me that I no longer want to be affiliated with a party that uses its power to pressure dissenting voices to capitulate to party leadership.
I do not know why the Democratic caucus is so hell-bent on removing the religious exemption, but Rep. Jonathan Steinberg stated last year that it was the No. 1 goal of the Democratic caucus, and again, this year, the communication has been that this is of the highest priority to the Democratic leaders.
The two dissenting Democrats on the Public Health Committee, Rep. Jack Hennesy and Rep. David Michel, have been replaced by two representatives, Rep. Liz Linehan and Rep. Josh Elliot, who have regular social media battles with the mothers of injured children. To replace the two ""friendly"" Democrats with such vocal and often rude opponents to these mothers shows disdain in a way that I cannot conscience.
Because of this, today, when I renewed my driver's license, I switched my party affiliation, and registered as a Republican.
I'd like to say that I appreciate the consideration from the Fairfield Democrats who tried to allow space for my viewpoint within the Democratic Party in Fairfield, and I regret leaving the friends that I have worked with on issues related to our town within the caucus.
However, I cannot stand by as I watch the Democratic Party become a bully pulpit, as I believe was demonstrated by the replacement of Reps. Hennessy and Michel with these particular new Public Health Committee members.
I must also now resign from the DTC, as well as the Democratic caucus of the RTM.
Regretfully,
Representative Hannah Gale, District 6, Fairfield"
