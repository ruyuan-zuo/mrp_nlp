Max Rosen of Glencoe has been selected to receive New Trier Township's Peer Jury Scholarship Award for 2020. The $1,500 prize will be used toward his education at George Washington University in Washington D.C. where he begins freshman year this fall.
Community Services Director Brian Leverenz said, ""His essay was outstanding, but Max's leadership, attendance and thoughtful participation as a juror put him over the top against other candidates.""
Created in 1998, the township's Peer Jury program provides an opportunity for first-time, (non-violent) offenders to face a jury of his/her peers. The jury hears the charges presented by a police officer, and the jurors, under the supervision of the Peer Jury Coordinator agrees on an appropriate sentence - usually a number of hours of community service and sometimes a written paper or an apology.
The Peer Jury Scholarship is normally presented at the Township's Annual Town Meeting, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

April 28, 2020
Dear Governor Pritzker,
During this unprecedented challenge to our state, you stressed multiple times your willingness and eagerness to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle and from every part of the state. As the women of the House Republican Caucus, we stand ready to offer solutions and work with you to implement a safe and reasonable regional plan to open Illinois. We are business owners, scientists, mayors, lawyers, community organizers, volunteers, officers, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, caregivers, and legislators. We represent 880,000 Illinoisans across all regions of the state—from the Chicago suburbs to regions in northern, western, eastern, southern, and central Illinois.
Our family members and constituents are fighting on the front lines as healthcare workers. We know and love people who are diagnosed with and suffering from COVID-19. We know, love, and represent people who lost their jobs, closed their small businesses, and exhausted their savings. For us, this is not political. This is personal.
We asked many questions concerning IDPH modeling, PPE procurement process and inventory, IDOC policies for transfers and releases, issues at IDES, safeguarding Long Term Care Facilities, and protecting state facilities for veterans and the developmentally disabled. We made many suggestions to promote physical and mental wellbeing, including opening state parks, locking down our prisons, housing our homeless, and protecting our most vulnerable populations. You did respond to our request for IDNR to open our state parks, thank you.
Unfortunately, a majority of our questions and suggestions are not acknowledged. We reached out to you, but you have not contacted one Republican woman legislator to discuss our concerns, suggestions, or solutions. We are writing to tell you as a matter of record the House Republican Women are here for Illinois. We are ready to offer suggestions, strategies, and solutions; and we are calling for the legislature to reconvene. We want to do our job as essential employees for our state and want to work with you to safely and regionally reopen our state.
SAFELY
● As elected officials, we have a responsibility to all Illinois citizens. Our number one priority as wereopen Illinois is to protect those who are vulnerable to this virus and ensure they have the appropriate support and necessary resources.
REASONABLY
● Illinois needs a reasoned and common-sense plan to reopen our state region by region understanding the virus affects each region differently. Some of these common sense steps include:
RESPONSIBLY
● Our constituents deserve a responsible government—a government where there are effective checks and balances and a government where all voices are heard. A responsible government means calling the legislature back to session.
REGIONALLY
● One size does not fit all. We must safely open our state on a regional basis. Other states including New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa proposed measured, regional reopening strategies.
We, the women of the House Republican Caucus, ask you to work with us. We are prepared to work on a serious plan to reopen Illinois safely, reasonably, responsibly, and regionally. We request you meet with us collectively as a group to share our ideas and offer solutions. We must continue to protect our vulnerable populations and safeguard our healthcare delivery systems, while we must also save our economy and our families. We are prepared to assist in developing and implementing a plan to safely get Illinois back to business reasonably, regionally, and responsibly.
Finally, as members of a co-equal branch of government, we request you call a special legislative session to start work on reopening Illinois safely and regionally.
We are ready and await a meeting with you.
Sincerely,
Rep. Avery Bourne

2,/illinois/wilmette/face-coverings-required-wilmette-slow-spread-coronavirus,2020-04-20T16:00:00Z,Face Coverings Required In Wilmette,0,1,Jonah Meadows,Patch Staff,"WILMETTE, IL — Face coverings are mandatory for shoppers and workers at essential businesses in Wilmette under an amended coronavirus disaster declaration signed by Village President Bob Bielinski. An order requiring everyone aged 3 and up within village limits to cover their nose and mouth while engaging in essential activities or riding in public transportation, taxis or ride-hailing vehicles took effect Monday. It does not apply while outdoors or in personal cars.
Village staff were already required to wear face covering anytime they have contact with the public or come within 6 feet of another employee, Bielinski said in a letter to residents and business owners. Business managers may refuse admission or service or anyone who fails to wear a face covering, ""should the business feel that the safety of customer or employees would be best served by doing so,"" he said.
""We, as residents, business owners and visitors, are all part of the community that makes Wilmette a great place. As part of that communal relationship, we all owe each other a duty to help prevent the spread of this disease,"" he said. ""Wearing a face covering when entering a business open to the public is a simple task that we can all do for the good of not only Wilmette, but for everyone near and far.""
Illinois Coronavirus Update April 20: Don't miss updates about precautions in the Wilmette area as they are announced. Sign up for Wilmette-Kenilworth news alerts and newsletters.

On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recommendation people wear face coverings when they are unable to practice socially distancing. The effort is aimed at reducing the risk of coronavirus transmission, especially from those who do not show symptoms of infection. Due to a chronic shortage of protective equipment across the country, public health officials have called for surgical masks and N95 respirators to be reserved for emergency personnel and health care workers. The CDC has published instructions on how to make, wear and clean cloth face coverings at home.
According to the village's second amended local disaster declaration, acceptable face coverings in Wilmette include, but are not limited to, non-medical grade face masks, cloth or plastic masks, scarfs, bandanas or handkerchiefs. Face coverings are not required for employees of Amazon, FedEx, UPS or the United States Postal Service, according to the village's website. Landscapers do not have to wear face coverings while working outside, and private contractors are not required to cover their faces while working indoors, although village officials encouraged homeowners to ask them to do so.
As of Monday, Wilmette had 75 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and there were 13 cases detected among Kenilworth residents, according to the Cook County Department of Public Health. Cook County Medical Examiner's Office records indicate one Wilmette resident, a 101-year-old woman, died of the virus, however, the CEO of the nursing home listed as her residence said she had not lived there under its current ownership.
Municipal officials in Wilmette followed those in the Chicago-area suburbs of Glenview, Cicero, Skokie, Morton Grove, Niles, Northbrook and Highland Park in issuing local face-covering orders. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said he is considering a statewide requirement, describing wearing a mask in public as a ""common sense way"" to reduce the spread of COVID-19."

The $375,000 tax rebate program allows eligible businesses to receive half of the municipal sales tax they collected last year as a grant. That money can be used for payroll, paying bills and operating expenses but cannot be used for capital improvements or rent, according to village staff.
""We recognize that COVID-19 has placed a substantial burden on the Village's small business community. This program will provide funds for businesses that need help now making payroll or paying suppliers,"" Village President Bob Bielinski said in a release. ""As a local government, Wilmette has the ability to move faster than the federal and state governments which are implementing more substantial financial assistance programs for small businesses. The intent of this program is to put money into the hands of businesses immediately so they can continue to remain in business until they are able to access those larger programs.""
Illinois Coronavirus Update March 27: U.S. Surpasses China: Don't miss updates about precautions in the Chicago area as they are announced. Sign up for Patch news alerts and newsletters.

The grants are available to businesses with village businesses licenses that generated between $50,000 and $7.5 million in municipal sales tax-eligible revenue in 2019. Those sales must have declined by at least 15 percent between March 21 and the application date, compared to the prior year. Chains with five or more locations, franchisees, private clubs and home occupations are not eligible, according to program rules.
""Because our local businesses are a critical part of the vitality of the Village and because the sales tax they generate is an important funding source for municipal services and infrastructure, supporting local businesses is good public policy,"" Bielinski added. ""While we are hopeful that this program will give businesses some short-term economic relief, it is absolutely vital that Wilmette residents continue to support our local restaurants and retailers by responsibly shopping at local businesses which remain open because the State has deemed them essential, ordering takeout and delivery from restaurants, and making online purchases. We can all work together to help our business community during this very challenging time.""
Municipal sales tax is separate from the village's home rule sales tax. In 2019, the village received $2.63 million from municipal sales tax, which is equal to 1 percent of all retail sales that occurred in a given municipality.
To receive the tax relief from the village, local businesses must have been operational March 17 and must not have permanently ceased operations, according to rules. Businesses that plan to reopen after being forced to close due to Gov. JB Pritzker's stay-at-home order are eligible for the rebate.
Bielinski declared a local disaster public health emergency on March 17, and the amendment to the village code and resolution extending the disaster declaration approved Tuesday added the authorization to spend up to $500,000 to help local businesses, according to a memo to the board from Village Manager Michael Braiman and Corporation Counsel Jeffrey Stein. The declaration also allowed the village to request reimbursements from the state and federal government in the future.
Other amended emergency authorities include:

The March 17 vote, which happens to fall on St. Patrick's Day, will allocate the state's delegates to the Democratic and Republican national presidential nominating conventions this summer, and voters will also pick candidates in some contested statehouse and congressional party primaries.
With the recent impeachment of Republican President Donald Trump and 13 Democratic candidates set to appear on the Illinois ballot, eight of whom are still campaigning for the nomination, the race for the White House is heating up.
Six Democratic candidates submitted lists of delegates they are seeking to represent them from the 9th Congressional District. The list of potential delegates set to appear on the ballot included Wilmette resident Christoper Dunn, who hopes to be a convention delegate for former Vice President Joe Biden. Billionaires Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer did not submit delegate lists, nor did U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
There are no competitive congressional primaries in the 9th District, where Sargis Sangari makes his second attempt to unseat U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky.
Likewise, voters will not have a choice in local races for the Illinois General Assembly. In the 17th District, Rep. Jennifer Gong-Gershowitz, of Glenview, is unopposed in the Democratic Party primary and Yesoe Yoon, of Skokie, has no opposition in the Republican primary. No Republicans or Democrats are seeking the nomination to run against Rep. Robyn Gabel, of Evanston, in the 18th District.
Before early voting begins on March 2, Patch wants to hear from the community. What are the biggest issues facing Illinois and the nation heading into the primary? What impact does national politics have on local voters?

10,/illinois/wilmette/trustees-consider-updated-optima-wilmette-development-plans,2020-02-20T21:06:46Z,Developers Submits Updated Plans Ahead Of Vote,0,0,Jonah Meadows,Patch Staff,"WILMETTE, IL — The developer behind a proposal to build a 109-unit mixed-use development across from the Metra station submitted revised plans this week ahead of next week's Wilmette Village Board meeting.
Optima Inc. wants trustees to permit a seven-story planned unit development at the northwest corner of Green Bay Road and Central Avenue, on the current site of the Wilmette branch of the International Bank of Chicago. The Glencoe-based residential real estate firm submitted a preliminary application in November. The proposed design includes retail, office and residential space at ground level and a penthouse on its top floor.
Following discussions at two meetings earlier this year, the village's plan commission voted 5-2 against recommending approval of the proposal to the village board. Commissioners expressed concerns about the height of the building as well as the proposed public benefit. At its tallest point, the building would be nearly 80 feet high. The maximum height permitted at the site under existing village rules is four stories and 52 feet.
As a result, the development would require a supermajority of trustees of the six-member board to vote in its favor, William Bradford, the commission's chairman, said at the Feb. 4 meeting. Though he voted against the plans as presented at the meeting, Bradford said he saw the public benefits of the project, in terms of increasing housing units and additional potential retail space.
""I think from a vitalization standpoint, if you look along Green Bay Road right now, it's like somebody with a bad set of teeth. It's very porous,"" Bradford said. ""This development proposal does help to get rid of a lot of open surface parking lot but also helps to reinforce the street edge, and I think that helps to create a much stronger street presence for the village.""
Commissioner Mariah DiGrino said she remained unconvinced by the public benefits promised by the developers, which mainly boiled down to commitments to bird-friendly design and a donation toward affordable housing.
""For me, it's not enough to justify the significant amount of relief they're requesting. These really ask us to balance a policy decision in favor of affordable housing, which, while it is a very important policy decision, it requires us to, really, ignore everything else,"" DiGrino said.
According to Optima's updated application materials, the developer wants a dozen exceptions to village regulations. They include: permitting office use and residential units on the ground floor, allowing the development to exceed the maximum allowable height by more than 20 feet to allow a seventh-floor penthouse, and decreasing minimum ground floor height and pedestrian access requirements, among other things.
Benefits identified by the developer include a 1,212-square-foot public plaza with seating and an art installation, 23 additional public parking places and two electric vehicle charging stations. The development would also be the village's first to be built with a bird-friendly design, would achieve the equivalent of LEED Silver certification and would promote redevelopment and reinvestment in the village center, according to Optima Senior Vice President Mark Segal.
The proposed building would not have any affordable units on site, but the developers said they intended to donate $1.6 million to the nonprofit Community Partners for Affordable Housing. That would be enough to establish 14 permanently affordable homes elsewhere in the village and ""develop a sustainable infrastructure to build, expand and manage a stock of affordable housing that will remain affordable in perpetuity for Wilmette residents,"" Segal said in a Feb. 18 letter to village staff.
""We believe that our efforts to fully respond to the comments and direction provided by the Plan Commission have resulted in significant enhancements to our project that will enable it to be an attractive and desirable contribution to the Village Center District and the Village as a whole.""
Commissioner Jeffrey Head said he believed everyone on the commission agreed that the development would generally be a positive addition and meet the goals of the village's master plan.
""But as I think most of us have said,"" Head said, ""the benefit relative to the relief seems mismatched.""
Bradford, Head and DiGrino voted against the proposal, as did Commissioners Homa Ghaemi and Justin Sheperd. Commissioners Michael Taylor and Steven Schwab voted in favor.
Village trustees are scheduled to consider the proposed at their Feb. 25 meeting.

Frenzer joined the Village of Wilmette as its corporation counsel in Jan. 1993 and served in that role for 15 years until he assumed the role of interim village Mmanager. The village board unanimously appointed Frenzer to village manager in July 2009.
""Over the years, I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with many elected officials, as well as boards and commissions members, and residents,"" Frenzer said. ""The commitment of the Village Board members to ensuring good government and providing forward-looking leadership has ensured that Wilmette is a very special place in which to live and work.""
Frenzer also thanked the members of the Village staff, saying that, ""It has been my privilege to work with, and my honor to lead, an incredibly talented and highly committed Village staff. Their professionalism, dedication and expertise leaves me filled with pride in them and humbled to have had the opportunity to work as their manager for the last ten years.""
When Frenzer took over as manager, the village was experiencing serious revenue disruption due to the Great Recession. Frenzer and his team worked to stabilize the village's finances and reduce costs while maintaining the village's coveted AAA bond rating and village services.
According to the village, Frenzer led many projects that will have long-lasting positive benefits to the Wilmette community, including preparation of a Village Center Master Plan and revitalization of the village's downtown, modernizing solid waste and recycling collection, infrastructure projects, such as the successful West Park Sanitary Storage Facility project, and many new resident services, including online services and resident request tracking.
Frenzer also negotiated several new wholesale water contracts with other municipalities that generate new revenue hold down water rates for Wilmette. He said he looks forward to having additional time to spend with his family, and to explore other professional opportunities.
""Tim took over as Village Manager during very challenging economic times,"" said Village President Bob Bielinski. ""His steady and thoughtful leadership stabilized and then improved the Village's finances, and has contributed to new economic development and improved resident services. The Village is fortunate to have an incredibly professional and qualified staff, which is a testament to Tim's leadership and his ability to attract and retain top talent. The Village Board and I are all grateful to Tim for his dedicated service to the Village and wish him all the best in retirement.""

16,/illinois/wilmette/disgraced-pastor-sues-radio-host-over-defamation-claims,2019-12-17T01:18:41Z,Pastor Sues Radio Host Over Defamation Claims,0,2,Jonah Meadows,Patch Staff,"CHICAGO — The disgraced former pastor of a suburban megachurch sued a radio host last week, alleging he broadcast defamatory stories on his syndicated morning show and podcast.
James MacDonald, fired earlier this year as senior pastor of Rolling Meadows-based Harvest Bible Chapel, filed the defamation suit Thursday in Cook County Circuit Court against longtime shock-jock Erich ""Mancow"" Muller, who currently hosts a daily program on WLS-AM in Chicago.
The eight-count complaint names as defendants Muller, five unidentified producers and Cumulus Media, the station's parent company. It includes four counts of defamation, four counts of false light invasion of privacy, four counts of intentional infliction of emotional distress, two counts of eavesdropping and one count each of negligent hiring, reckless hiring, negligent supervision and reckless supervision.
A congregant at the 12,000-member Harvest Bible Chapel since 2014 and friend of MacDonald since 2016, Muller began publicly criticizing the pastor on his show in January as former church members detailed allegations of financial and personal misconduct by MacDonald. That month, Muller published an editorial in the Daily Herald calling for the pastor and the church elders to be fired and replaced.
""[MacDonald's] advice put me 'on the sunny side' and kept me on the right path more than once, Muller wrote. ""But he also created THIS: a culture of authoritarianism, secrecy, intimidation, outlandish fundraising expectations, poor financial controls and debt.""
MacDonald was fired from the church in February, and the entire board of elders was replaced.
The message that the lawsuit claims shows Muller's malice — ""that MacDonald lacked integrity as a pastor"" — was later substantiated by the results of Harvest's own internal investigation, which led the church to disqualify its former pastor from ever again holding a leadership role there.
Harvest leaders announced last month an investigation into his conduct revealed a ""substantial pattern of sinful behavior."" Its founding pastor was ""biblically disqualified"" from ever serving again as a pastor or elder in church he founded in 1988, according to a statement from the board. Harvest and MacDonald later entered into binding arbitration to resolve claims related to his termination and the ownership of broadcast ministry Walk in the Word.

According to the defamation suit against Muller, the radio host launched a ""campaign to disparage"" the pastor ""through a series of false and defamatory statements"" in February. It claims Muller was motivated by a desire to promote his radio show — rather than out of a sense of betrayal and desire to prevent the pastor from being ""able to fleece people in the future,"" as the broadcaster claimed.
""Muller began his show with negative speculation that MacDonald was involved in a racketeering scheme, suggested to listeners that MacDonald lacked the integrity to be a pastor, and smeared MacDonald's name generally, communicating to listeners his malice against MacDonald. He then falsely accused MacDonald of engaging in specific bad acts,"" the suit alleges.
Some of those specific bad acts relate to statements made by MacDonald himself in recorded phone conversations, which include the pastor suggesting the CEO of a Christian news magazine could be brought down by planting child pornography on his computer. Muller played audio of the conversation on his radio show and said people from the church told him MacDonald would attempt to place ""child porn on my computer to get me to shut up.""
The lawsuit claims Muller knew the statements were false when he made them and described Muller's description of MacDonald as a ""con man"" as malicious and defamatory. Also defamatory, according to the complaint, was Muller's Feb. 18, 2019, interview with a woman who described being groped by MacDonald while returning from a mission trip to California on the private plane MacDonald shared with Bill Hybels, the founder of Willow Creek Community Church who resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations.
The complaint was filed on MacDonald's behalf by Phil Zisook and Richard Goldwasser of Chicago-based Schoenberg Finkel Newman & Rosenberg. Zisook, who specializes in defamation cases, has previously unsuccessfully sued the University of Illinois at Chicago student newspaper, an ex-professional wrestler and two brothers who described abuse by a Catholic priest, according to court records and media reports.
But Zisook has found success suing Muller in the past. With Zisook as his attorney, former Chicago Bear Keith Van Horne sued Muller in 1994 in a case presented in last week's complaint to suggest Cumulus should have known the radio host had been sued for ""defamatory speech in the course of his radio broadcast."" According to media columnist Robert Feder, the suit was settled five years later for $1.6 million in what was considered one of the largest settlements in a defamation suit against a radio host at the time.
""For me this has always been about trying to help people and trying to expose a bad guy,"" Muller told Feder in response to MacDonald's suit. ""For years I had endorsed [McDonald] and his church. When I found out the truth, I felt it was my duty to tell my listeners.""
The defamation suit, first reported by the Cook County Record, is the second filed by the pastor against his critics in the past 18 months.
In October 2018, MacDonald and Harvest sued reporter Julie Roy as well as the authors of a blog wrote about MacDonald and their wives. According to Roy, that suit was dropped after a judge denied the church's motion to keep documents secret.
Church officials later publicly apologized for the ""sinful violation"" of the suit and reimbursed the people it sued for their legal expenses, according to a statement posted and later removed from the church's website.

The mayor's office had argued the arrangement allowed the adviser to live in Wilmette and avoid the residency requirement that applies to most city employees.
Lisa Schneider-Fabes, Wilmette School District 39 board president, is stepping down Friday from her position with World Business Chicago, the 20-year-old public-private partnership that promotes Chicago to businesses and pushes for economic development, the Tribune reported. The same day, she will end her ""planned detail"" to the mayor's office.
Before that, she served as transition manager for the Lightfoot administration, the Chicago Sun-Times reported days after the April runoff election. According to Politico, the business and government consultant had previously worked with the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force, Chicago Public Schools and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, where she helped government and department clients follow housing and environmental regulations.
World Business Chicago is chaired by the mayor and receives about $1.7 million in annual public funding but is exempt from public records laws and the city's residency requirement. Schneider-Fabes began her position as vice president of strategic initiatives when Lightfoot was sworn in. The Tribune reported the nonprofit refuses to say how much it has been paying Schneider-Fabes in the role, which involved being immediately detailed to the mayor's office, according to the Tribune. The newspaper identified 11 volunteer employees in the mayor's office from the Civil Consulting Alliance, branch of the Commercial Club of Chicago chaired by Brian Fabes, the husband of Schneider-Fabes.
According to the Tribune, Schneider-Fabes attended senior staff meetings, human resources interviews and planning for major speeches in the mayor's office. A spokesperson for the inspector general's office told the paper the office had previously advised the mayor that those who manage city resources and employees and make decisions impacting city policy should be considered employees, whether paid or unpaid, and subject to city residency requirements."
18,/illinois/wilmette/wilmette-residents-start-paying-annual-stormwater-utility-fee,2019-11-20T17:32:04Z,Wilmette Residents To Start Annual Paying Stormwat,0,0,Jonah Meadows,Patch Staff,"WILMETTE, IL — Starting Jan. 1, property owners in Wilmette will start to be assessed a new fee to cover the cost of the village's largest-ever single public works investment. The $68 million Neighborhood Storage Improvement project will cost approximately $4 million a year to cover its cost, according to village staff.
To calculate residential stormwater utility fees, homeowners will be divided into three tiers depending on how much impervious surface area their property has. Impervious areas include pavement, decks and patios. It does not include lawns, gardens or swimming pools.
About half of single-family homes in the village have between 3,000 and 4,300 square feet of impervious surface, according to the village. A quarter of homes have less, a quarter have more and all homeowners will be billed quarterly on their utility bills.
The largest homes will pay $186 in the first year. Those in the middle will be billed $144. The smallest will pay $118 in 2020. Over time, the fees will increase, with the rates eventually calculated based on the actual final cost of the project and the interest rates paid to finance it, according to the village.
Village trustees decided on a three-tier fee schedule based on property size was the most practical and reasonable way of covering the cost of the project, since it would be ""logistically impossible"" to calculate a fee based on the unique features and sizes of more than 8,000 single-family homes.
Residents can check which tier their home is included in can click on ""stormwater bill estimate"" in the village's community portal or review a video showing how to check their property's estimates impervious area. Those who feel their properties have been included in the wrong tier can submit a request to change it online or by email to stormwater@wilmette.com. Each commercial property will have its impervious surface area measured individually to calculate their fees, staff told Pioneer Press.
In July, an Illinois appellate panel ruled unanimously that stormwater fees based on impervious area are not illegal on the Illinois Constitution and Municipal Code, rejecting a challenge from Winnetka resident Mark Green. The decision ended more than four years of litigation that cost the village over $280,000 in legal fees.

The first construction on the project is complete on Orchard Lane with work on Lavergne Avenue expected to be complete by Thanksgiving, according to a project page for the West Side Neighborhood Storage Project.
The first stages of the project are expected to be complete by the end of the year, with the other stages complete by the summer of 2020 allowing for work to begin at Community Playfield at 702 Locust Road.
The initial work includes building large relief storm sewers in residential areas currently subject to flooding. Once they are complete, three more phases of construction are anticipated, with the whole project complete by 2023.

The new stormwater fee is anticipated to be the largest tax or fee increase Wilmette residents will be paying. For the average home, the village's proposed 2020 budget also includes an annual increases of $40 in property tax, $50 for the road program and $13 to sewer rates, according to a presentation to the village board last month. The budget includes $23.21 million for Phase 1A and 1 of the project."

""With such an unusual start to summer, we hope that the addition of the season extension will allow season pass holders to maximize their time at the beach,"" park district officials said in a statement.
On Wednesday, district staff learned an employee at the sailing beach tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The employee was last at work between 2 and 8 p.m. Monday and may have been contagious at that time, according to a statement from park district staff.
The beach is set to remain open, but all facilities and supplies related to the area of the sailing beach are being disinfected. District staff encouraged the public to monitor their own health if they may have been exposed to the infected staffer.
The decision to have a one-time extension to the beach season was made in response to the circumstances surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.
The swimming beach and parking lot will be open for season pass and parking permit holders only, and the temporary fence at the South Beach is due to remain up until late in the fall, according to the district.
Last month, district staff erected the the fence because of a large number of visitors congregating in large groups and neglecting social distancing requirements.
During a postseason period from Sept. 8 to Sept. 27, there will be no lifeguards on duty at the swimming beach. Swimmers may swim at their own risk.
The prohibition on swimming at South Beach will be strictly enforced by park district staff and Wilmette police, according to the district. South beach is open only for walking, and congregating there is also forbidden.

One of these drop boxes will be available at Centennial Ice Rinks, 2300 Old Glenview Road in Wilmette.
The drop boxes will circumvent the USPS as the mail ballots will be securely delivered directly to the clerk's office, according to its website. Mail ballots will be mailed out to all Cook County voters who apply to receive a mail ballot beginning Sept. 24.
The decision to add the mail boxes comes at the same time operational changes within the USPS have reportedly led to widespread mail delays, elimination of overtime for postal workers, carriers being instructed to leave mail behind and the decommissioning of mail sorting machines.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in May and began in the position in June, has been connected to the changes. Following the filing of a federal lawsuit by 14 state attorneys general —including Kwame Raoul of Illinois — and public outcry, DeJoy said Tuesday the changes will be suspended until after the Nov. 3 election.
There will be postage-paid return envelopes for voters who wish to mail back their ballot, according to the clerk's office. Voters are urged to complete and mail their ballot back as early as possible once they receive it.
Voters can drop off their completed mail ballots between 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. on weekends at the drop boxes located at early voting sites in Cook County. Mail ballots will be collected on a daily basis and will be time stamped.
Voters who applied for their mail ballot online will receive an email at the time their mail ballot is sent to them, as well as an email notifying them when the completed ballot has been received back from the voter, according to the clerk's office.
Drop boxes for mail ballots will be available beginning Oct. 9 at 69 West Washington St. in Chicago, as well as the five regional courthouses in suburban Cook County located in Rolling Meadows, Skokie, Maywood, Bridgeview and Markham. Drop boxes will be available at the remaining early voting sites beginning Oct. 19.
Other nearby confirmed drop box locations include the Lorraine H. Morton Civic Center at 2100 Ridge Ave. in Evanston and Village Hall at 5127 Oakton St. in Skokie. Clerk's office officials said a complete list of Cook County drop boxes will be updated when new locations are added or with any changes.

Wilmette voters will be asked whether they favor permitting local cannabis business in a non-binding question on the November ballot. When asked if local officials should allow marijuana shops in town, nearly 59 percent of self-identified Wilmette and Kenilworth respondents to the unscientific survey favored opting in.
More than 70 percent of Wilmette-Kenilworth Patch readers who responded said the state legislature made the right decision when it voted to legalize the possession and sale of recreational cannabis last year. That's 5 percent less than average among the poll's nearly 1,700 north suburban respondents.
Local respondents broadly shared the view of their North Shore counterparts when it comes to how the implementation of cannabis legalization has proceeded when compared to expectations.
Respondents who supported allowing recreational marijuana businesses in town were asked where they would like the tax revenue to be allocated. The most common responses were infrastructure, schools, and property tax relief.
When respondents were asked what they would change about the state's cannabis rules, Wilmette-Kenilworth Patch readers were mostly supportive of existing regulations. A few suggested allowing buyers to see products before buying them, allowing Amsterdam-style ""coffeeshops"" and reducing the opportunities for politicians to determine who gets a license.
""Try to make it easier for employers to navigate laws surrounding use, avoid mishmash of politicians pushing different legislation that confuses the issues,"" one respondent said.
""I'm more of a libertarian and would legalize all drugs in an effort to 'defund' Chicago street gangs and Mexican narco cartels; who are killing tens of thousands of people a year and destroying more lives than addicts,"" another suggested.

Not even COVID-19 could stop the New Trier Township Food Pantry's Thanksgiving distribution. The township's first-ever contactless meal distribution was held in the parking lot of the Winnetka Presbyterian Church, as State mandated gathering restrictions prevent pantry clients from shopping inside the township hall in Winnetka.
The township pantry with assistance from generous individuals and the business community was able to provide 112 complete meals that included dinners to group homes of Glenkirk, Clearbrook and Lambs Farm, non-profit organizations that serve the needs of individuals facing developmental challenges.
This contactless distribution day was managed by a group of mask wearing volunteers and township staff, who greeted clients and placed a full-boxed meal in the trunk or hatchback area of the recipient's vehicle.
With the encouragement, goods and financial assistance of the generous North Shore residents, the township was able to deliver on this decades- old tradition of providing Thanksgiving joy to residents in need.

The current site of an International Bank of Chicago branch is located across the street from the downtown Wilmette train station.
Set to include 109 luxury apartment units and 8,000 square feet of ground floor retail space, developer Optima Inc. received final approval last month to build a planned unit development at 1210 Central Ave., less than a year after filing a preliminary application. All but nine of the apartments will be located above the ground floor, while the top floor will include a roof deck and garden.
Optima CEO David Hovey, the project's architect, contractor and developer, said he was excited to develop another project on Chicago's North Shore.
""As with each project we design and build, we're very careful to ensure the buildings respect their environment and have a positive impact on the surrounding neighborhood,"" Hovey said in a statement.
""This development will be no different, as not only will it deliver the size of homes and amenities residents in Wilmette want, but the exterior design will feature our signature vertical landscaping system and public art component that will enhance the downtown community's energy and aesthetic.""
Hovey's Glencoe-based firm has built 1618 Sheridan Road in 1991, Optima Center Wilmette at 1100 Central Ave. in 1997 and Lake Courts at 1925 Lake Ave. in 1998. In 2010, Optima completed the 20-story Old Orchard Woods condominium towers overlooking the Edens Expressway and the Harms Woods Forest Preserve. According to the firm, it has completed 20 projects on the North Shore over the past four decades.
The latest Wilmette proposal first came before the village's planning commissioners, who voted 5-2 on Feb. 4 to recommend trustees reject the project. The project was then revised with increased setbacks and added public benefits, and on March 10 the village board voted 5-2 to grant preliminary approval to the proposal. Ordinances clearing the way for the project were granted final approval unanimously at the Oct. 27 meeting of the Village Board.
RELATED: Trustees Considering Updated Optima Wilmette Development Plans
As part of the village ordinance authorizing the development, the developer is required to donate $1.6 million toward affordable housing, which the firm said should be enough to establish 14 permanently affordable units in the village and develop an infrastructure to expand its stock of affordable housing. Optima must also contribute $120,000 to the village to fund infrastructure improvements in the surrounding downtown area.
Village officials required the development to have bird-friendly glass, 28 public parking spaces in the development's new downtown garage and a public plaza area with outdoor seating at the southeast corner of the development.
Hovey has also committed to designing an original 8-foot sculpture near the entrance as public art and earning at least a Two Green Globes certification for sustainable construction practices.
Optima plans to include landscaping on the roof, with plans that stay green throughout the year, and have self-containing irrigation and drainage. The village has required that the development aid in reducing stormwater runoff.
""While we've long included green and sustainable features at our Chicago-area developments, the Wilmette project will introduce Optima's signature vertical landscaping to the region,"" Hovey said. ""We've identified some very special plants that will thrive in this environment.""
No information was immediately available from representatives of the firm about the expected cost of rent in the building or what kind of retailers are expected on the ground floor.
Optima is expected to begin demolishing the bank in the first quarter of 2021, with construction on the new building to begin before the end of the year. The developer and village staff said they anticipate the project will be complete sometime in mid-2023."

35,/illinois/wilmette/illinois-weed-sales-blaze-new-record-voters-welcome-pot-shops,2020-11-05T19:33:08Z,Illinois Weed Sales Blaze New Record As Voters...,0,8,Jonah Meadows,Patch Staff,"CHICAGO — A day after state regulators announced a sixth consecutive month of record cannabis sales, voters in six of the seven Chicago suburbs who were asked about allowing recreational marijuana retailers in their town appeared to answer in the affirmative. Five more states also legalized some form of cannabis at the ballot box Tuesday, including four more where voters approved its use by all adults.
In Illinois, all the referendums were non-binding, as state law does not allow voters a direct say on policy questions, although it does allow them to change their form of government and approve bond issues. (For instance: the constitutional amendment on Tuesday's ballot would have expanded the legislature's authority to set different income tax rates — but the rates themselves are a policy set by lawmakers.)
According to unofficial election results, residents of Batavia, Elk Grove Village, Mount Prospect, Park Ridge and Wilmette favored advisory referendum questions of whether to permit adult-use cannabis dispensaries in their suburbs. Voters in Western Springs rejected it. In Glen Ellyn, the pro-pot vote led by fewer than 300 votes as of Wednesday evening.
Two years ago, voters in Cook County were presented with the non-binding question of whether to legalize recreational marijuana. More than 68 percent favored allowing the production and sale of adult-use cannabis. The following year, Illinois became the first state in the nation where the legislature legalized the retail sale of marijuana rather than the voters.
Rather than asking voters if they favor legalization, the latest advisory referendums placed on the general election ballot by local government officials ask residents if they want marijuana businesses to be allowed in the suburbs. Local officials in each community would still need to adjust their zoning codes to make way for cannabis companies to set up shop, and an operator with a license from the state would still have to be interested in doing so.
Note: Election results below are unofficial and do not include late-arriving mail-in ballots, which must be accepted until Nov. 17 if postmarked on or before Election Day.
Across the nation on Election Day, five additional states legalized some form of cannabis, with voters approving measures in each state where they were asked. Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota said ""yes"" to recreational weed, while Mississippians approved medicinal marijuana.
A total of 15 states — containing nearly a third of the U.S. population — have now legalized recreational marijuana or voted to do so. All but 14 states have enacted or voted to allow medical marijuana.
Erik Altiieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, said the results show that cannabis legalization has bipartisan support from a majority the country and is not only an issue in ""blue"" states.
""The public has spoken loudly and clearly. They favor ending the failed policies of marijuana prohibition and replacing it with a policy of legalization, regulation, taxation, and public education,"" Altiieri said in a statement. ""Elected officials — at both the state and federal level — ought to be listening.""
Marijuana Policy Project Executive Director Steve Hawkins called for landmark federal marijuana reform in 2021, regardless of who controls the White House and Congress.
""This historic set of victories will place even greater pressure on Congress to address the glaring and untenable conflicts between state and federal laws when it comes to cannabis legalization,"" Hawkins said. ""This is not a partisan issue. And with more Republican Senators representing states with medical marijuana and legal marijuana for adults, we're hopeful that marijuana reform can serve as an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation.
But last week, a joint statement from the medical societies of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania warned the costs to the public health system from cannabis use is likely to outweigh any financial benefits states gain through marijuana legalization.
""We appreciate the enormous challenges state policymakers face to address burgeoning budget deficits, but we strongly believe that further detailed research must be undertaken and assessed regarding the effects legalization of cannabis will have on important public health markers, such as emergency department visits and hospitalizations, impaired driving arrests, and the prevalence of psychiatric and addiction disorders,"" the statement said. ""We are very concerned that the long-term public health costs associated with hospitalizations and treatment for psychiatric/addictive disorders could significantly outweigh any revenues that these states anticipate would be received from the legalization of cannabis.""
On Monday, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation released figures showing sales of recreational cannabis rose by more than 11 percent from September to October.
More than $75 million worth of cannabis products — over 1.5 million items — were purchased last month in Illinois from the state's 67 recreational marijuana dispensaries, a significant portion of which are controlled by a handful of multi-state operators.
Illinois has collected more than $120 million in tax revenue in the first 10 months of sales. More than 95 percent of that goes to the state government. Local government's share of the adult-use cannabis tax revenue is capped at 3 percent, not counting other retail sales taxes.
The sales figures below do not include taxes or medical marijuana sales. Dispensaries in Illinois have sold record amounts of cannabis to in-state and out-of-state pot purchasers in each of the past six months.
Three new recreational cannabis dispensaries have opened in Illinois each of the last four months. Each is licensed under the state's original medical marijuana program, as the administration of Gov. J.B. Pritzker has delayed the issuance of licenses for 75 additional dispensaries that the legalization legislation had called for by May — as well as licenses for craft growers, infusers and transporters.
Illinois reportedly has the highest prices for legal cannabis in the nation.
No licenses have yet been issued under the ""social equity applicant"" program created by Illinois lawmakers. The governor's administration initially blamed the coronavirus pandemic for delays. After state officials announced the finalists for the licenses in September, lawsuits alleged problems in the scoring process, and Pritzker announced a review, which he said would be completed in the fall."

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, record numbers of early and mail-in votes have been cast, with about 100 million people having already voted heading into Election Day.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Cook County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.

According to the Cook County Clerk's Office, there were about 300,000 mail ballots received and still awaiting tallying across the Cook County suburbs. More than 100,000 more mail-in ballots also have yet to be received by the clerk's office, with state law requiring ballots received until Nov. 17 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked Tuesday or before.
More information about the number of outstanding votes remaining in each Wilmette precinct is expected by late Wednesday.
Following the passage of the law legalizing the possession and retail sale of marijuana in Illinois, village trustees chose not to allow retail cannabis businesses until after their constituents could express an opinion on the matter non-binding, advisory referendum.
Since then, several adult-use cannabis retailers have begun operating across the North Shore. A dispensary in a city-owned downtown Evanston parking garage opened on Jan. 1, in Niles in May, across from the Old Orchard shopping center in Skokie in August, and last month in Northbrook at Skokie Boulevard and Dundee Road.
Other New Trier Township communities have effective banned retail cannabis business through their zoning codes. Highland Park and Deerfield, though they each allowed medical cannabis dispensaries, did not allow recreational cannabis sale once it became legal in January. Deerfield built a temporary moratorium into their ordinance allowing a dispensary, and a divided Highland Park City Council changed course last month on whether to allow such businesses.

Regardless of what voters say — and what the Wilmette Village Board decides to do in response — there is no guarantee it will lead to weed being sold in Wilmette.
Although the village has never had any medical cannabis businesses, such operations are permitted under Wilmette's zoning code — but only in a very limited area.
With ample opportunities for affordable commercial properties on the borders of wealthy North Shore enclaves, cannabis retail operators have expressed little interest in setting up shop in any of the towns where they are currently forbidden.
The highly coveted permits to sell pot are tightly restricted. State cannabis regulators have delayed the licensing process by months, citing the challenges presented by the coronavirus. The ""social equity applicant"" process has been put on hold, leaving the owners of pre-existing licensed medical cannabis dispensaries a monopoly on the retail market. Announcing the delay amid a flurry of lawsuits and questions over the no-bid consulting services the state employed, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said ""the expectation here is that we'll be able to get this done this fall.""
In the first nine months of legalized marijuana in Illinois, buyers spent more than a half-billion dollars, including tax — even with far fewer retailers than the law contemplated. The vast majority of the $100 million in tax revenue collected goes to state coffers and programs. Local governments can only collect up to 3 percent tax. Current revenue estimates show municipalities expect to collect about $500,000 in sales tax per facility this year.
In an unscientific survey this summer, a majority of self-identified Wilmette-Kenilworth Patch readers favored opting to allow recreational cannabis businesses.
Illinois law does not permit binding referendums on matters of policy — only modifications to forms of local government, raising taxes and issuing debt.
Six other Chicago area communities also have non-binding referendums addressing cannabis businesses on the ballot this election.
In addition to Wilmette, cannabis referendums are also on the ballot in six other communities: Batavia, Elk Grove Village, Glen Ellyn, Mount Prospect, Park Ridge, Western Springs.

New Trier Township and the Village of Glencoe conducted a contactless children's book collection drive at the Glencoe Metra parking lot on October 16th. The event netted 15,000 books in four hours. An additional collection of 3,000 books from parents at the Joseph Sears School in Kenilworth was donated, elevating the final tally to 18,000.
The recipient of this massive donor turnout is Bernie's Book Bank, a Lake Bluff based non-profit organization that sources and distributes books to at-risk children throughout Illinois. Bernie's has distributed nearly 19 million books to children in low-income neighborhoods throughout Illinois since opening its doors in 2009.
""The pandemic has created additional income worries for low-income families who have little or no discretionary income for children's books, stated Dr. Alan Goldberg, Supervisor of New Trier Township. We are proud to be part of the solution that narrows the reading readiness divide, and are grateful to the hundreds of generous donors who took time to support Bernie's Book Bank.""
