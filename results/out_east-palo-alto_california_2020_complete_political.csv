According to the city manager's office, the increase of RVs in the city due to a lack of affordable housing options presented health and safety concerns that prompted the design of the pilot program.
The site, located at 1798 Bay Road, will accommodate 16 RVs throughout the night. The RVs are then asked to vacate during the day.
Participants will be required to engage with social workers sent by the nonprofit Project WeHOPE to assist them in their search for housing. Only RVs verified to have been in the city as of Jan. 15 were permitted to apply to the program because the city ""did not want to create a regional attraction for RVs,"" city officials said. There were 48 applicants. A waiting list remains active and RVs on the list are permitted to park on the streets for a while until they are admitted into the program.
A ceremony is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday to mark the opening of the site. Mayor Lisa Gauthier and other city officials and community members are expected to attend.

Haloti Lauese, 26, faces a sentence of up to life in prison for a crime spree on April 29, 2015, that began with a home invasion robbery at an apartment building in the 39800 block of Fremont Boulevard in Fremont and ended with him shooting at Newark and Fremont officers who pursued him to Menlo Park.
But Lauese will be eligible for parole after serving 20 years because he's considered a youthful offender since he was under the age of 23 at the time of his crimes. He's scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 11.
Alameda County prosecutor John Brouhard told jurors in his closing argument on Tuesday that Lauese should be convicted of three counts of premeditated attempted murder of a police officer because Newark officers Lisa Schwerin and Jeffrey Saunders and Fremont Detective Jeff Lawrence
""almost got killed"" when Lauese fired at them after they chased him to Menlo Park.
But Lauese's attorney Stephen Avilla said Lauese shouldn't be convicted of premeditated attempted murder because he thinks Lauese was only shooting in the general direction of the officers as he tried to flee and didn't intend to kill them.
Jurors, who only deliberated for a day, delivered a nuanced verdict, as they only found Lauese guilty of one count of premeditated attempted murder, which was for shooting at Lawrence.
Jurors found Lauese guilty of attempted murder for shooting at Saunders but didn't find that that the shots he fired at her were premeditated.
Jurors acquitted Lauese of the attempted murder charge involving Schwerin but found him guilty of three counts of assault on a police officer with a semi-automatic firearm for shooting at all three officers.
Jurors also found Lauese guilty of two counts of robbery in concert for the home invasion robbery in Fremont in which Lauese and co-defendants Demetrius Crayton and Shawn Thomas stole marijuana, a laptop, a cellphone and cash.
Thomas pleaded no contest to robbery with the special use of a firearm and Crayton pleaded guilty to one count of home invasion robbery in concert with the use of a firearm. Both men will be sentenced next year.
After the verdict, Brouhard said, ""I'm very pleased with the jury's verdict because Mr. Lauese put the officers' lives in great danger.""
Brouhard said he believes Lauese really wanted to kill the three officers because he aimed at them.
""Luckily he missed,"" Brouhard said.

The bill will go into effect in January, making any infractions punishable by a $500 fine. Employees of the prisons who are authorized to operate drones as part of their job will be exempt from the restrictions of the bill.

Potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl pose a high risk to drug users, members of the public and law enforcement officers alike. In 2016, there were 19 people in San Mateo County who died as a result of exposure to the drug, and more than 1,900 fatalities statewide, according to the report.
Equipping police with naloxone, which can be administered nasally, can save the lives of anyone accidentally exposed to fentanyl through skin contact or inhalation of airborne particles.
Sometimes those victims include law enforcement officers investigating drug cases. Police dogs face some of the same risks, and can also be saved by administering naloxone.
While medical professionals frequently already have access to naloxone, law enforcement officers are frequently the first on scene for opioid overdoses, particularly in sparsely populated areas, according to the
report.
With roughly an hour of training, officers can administer the drug relatively easily -- and so far more than 35 law enforcement agencies in California have opted to equip their personnel with it.
The grand jury's report indicates that there's a pilot program under development by the San Mateo County Joint Narcotics Task Force, but as of this morning no other law enforcement agencies in the county were training or equipping their personnel to use or carry the life-saving drug.
Thursday afternoon, however, the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office announced that their deputies had undergone the training and would begin carrying Narcan to assist the public and each other.
Sheriff' Carlos Bolanos called it ""an important safety tool for my personnel and the community.""

Measure L, a $166 parcel tax proposed by the Brisbane School District, narrowly passed with 67.3 percent of voters, just above the two-thirds majority needed for approval.
School district funding measures in the Las Lomitas Elementary School District, Pacifica School District and Ravenswood City School District passed with more comfortable margins.
Millbrae School District had 74.5 percent of the vote needed for Measure N.
The two non-school district measures on the San Mateo County ballot -- Foster City's Measure P to fund up to $90 million in bonds for levee improvements and Portola Valley's Measure T to reduce the utility user tax on telephone, gas, water and electricity -- also passed.

Unsealed Court Documents Reveal CPUC Repeatedly Blocked Investigation Stemming from the Penalty Case in the 2010 San Bruno PG&E Pipeline Explosion and Rate Cases Involving Other Utilities
SAN MATEO – State Senator Jerry Hill, Assemblymember Kevin Mullin and San Bruno Mayor Jim Ruane called upon Attorney General Xavier Becerra today to strongly urge that charges be filed as a result of the state's long-running criminal investigation of alleged corruption at the California Public Utilities Commission.
In a letter sent this morning, the three pointedly note that it has been more than three years since the investigation began—and since they first asked the Attorney General's Office to pursue charges in the probe that stemmed from the PG&E penalty proceeding in the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion and rate cases involving other utilities.
The letter today to Attorney General Becerra said recently unsealed court documents make an even more compelling case for forceful steps because it is now clear that ""the CPUC has been blocking your efforts at every turn."" This has included spending millions in taxpayer money for outside lawyers who, the CPUC claimed publicly, were to help the agency ""comply with all applicable legal obligations,"" the letter said.
Instead, the CPUC and its lawyers refused to turn over documents, did little to comply with search warrants and subpoenas, and filed motions to quash search warrants. The legal maneuvering and the misrepresentations of how taxpayer money was used were disclosed in records that were unsealed last week.
In addition to their letter, San Bruno Mayor Ruane and Assemblymember Mullin and Senator Hill, who represent San Bruno in the state Legislature, issued the following statements:
""It has been over seven years since the explosion in our community that took the lives of eight innocent citizens,"" said San Bruno Mayor Ruane. ""Numerous investigations since that time have revealed many troubling deficiencies in the CPUC's regulatory process ranging from lack of appropriate transparency to outright and pervasive collusion and corruption at the highest levels of the agency. It is time for the Attorney General's Office to take action. We cannot continue to wait.""
""Recently unsealed court records show that the CPUC continues to have a significant credibility problem and as a result, the public interest is not being served,"" said Assemblymember Kevin Mullin, D-South San Francisco. ""Not only do Californians have to worry about whether or not they are being protected by the entity responsible for regulating public utilities, they also have to worry about how ratepayer dollars are being spent. The collusion and dereliction of duty that came to light after the PG&E pipeline explosion in San Bruno appears to be alive and well and it is imperative that the Attorney General and his staff fully investigate these latest allegations and prosecute them fully.""
""The actions revealed by recently unsealed legal records are deeply troubling,"" said Senator Hill, D-San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. ""They are not what we have come to expect from the CPUC, given its new leadership and stated commitments to transparency and accountability. We have zero tolerance for the incidents that were at the core of the original investigation, and we have zero tolerance for actions that echo past practices by bad actors. We emphatically urge the Attorney General to fully and vigorously prosecute any violations of the law.""
In 2016, a federal jury found PG&E guilty of felony charges for obstructing the federal investigation of the 2010 natural gas pipeline explosion that leveled a San Bruno neighborhood and for violating pipeline safety laws before and after the tragedy. In January 2017, a federal judge imposed the maximum $3 million fine on PG&E.
No charges have been filed against the CPUC related to the San Bruno explosion or in the investigations that followed the disaster and unrelated proceedings involving other utilities.

The deadline for contest entries is Jan. 12, 2018.
For the contest, Senator Hill will consider ideas from constituents for new legislation or the repeal of outdated laws. Typically, the senator selects a standout bill idea and introduces legislation based on it. But the contest isn't limited to a single winning idea, if there are other equally strong entries.
""I always welcome great bill ideas and if there is more than one winner, that's terrific – our record is four winners in a single year,"" said Senator Hill, referring to four bills inspired by constituents that he introduced in 2016, two of which became laws. The laws crack down on water-guzzling households during droughts and ease the property tax burden of two small nonprofits that provide affordable housing to families and individuals in need.
""I already plan to introduce a bill in January requiring the three major credit reporting companies to provide free credit freezes to Californians – and that legislation was prompted by the outrage and demand for action from constituents after the massive breach of personal data and credit information at Equifax,"" Senator Hill said. ""Sixteen constituents contacted my office after learning that the data of 145 million people was exposed in ahack of Equifax. All 16 constituents said consumers should be allowed to freeze and unfreeze their credit information without the $10 fee usually charged for this measure of self-protection.""
""If there are strong ideas for other bills that can aid our community as well as California, I'll definitely consider them,"" the senator added. ""We've had great legislative successes with the 'Oughta Be a Law Contest…Or Not.' It is a wonderful opportunity for constituents to participate in the legislative process and help bring about positive change.""
The contest is open to all constituents of the 13th Senate District. Constituents may submit their ideas for improving the quality of life in San Mateo County, Santa Clara County and the state of California. Ideas may vary from statewide reforms to local community improvements that are within the purview of the state Legislature. Entries may call for the creation of a new law or the repeal of an obsolete law.
Past winners have testified on behalf of their bill idea in Assembly or Senate committees and many have also had their bill ideas signed into law.
To obtain an entry form, visit Senator Hill's website at:
An entry form also can also be obtained by calling Senator Hill's district office at 650-212-3313.
Completed entry forms may be emailed to Senator.Hill@senate.ca.gov, faxed to his district office at 650-212-3320, or mailed to the district office at 1528 South El Camino Real, Suite 303, San Mateo, CA 94402. Entries must be received by Jan. 12, 2018.
