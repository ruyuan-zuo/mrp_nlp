5/28/2020 - New Jersey Tree Recovery Campaign Provides Free Tree Seedlings to Residents in Aberdeen Township on Saturday, May 30
On Saturday May 30, residents will be able to pick up free tree seedlings at the Butterfly Garden at the rear of the entrance driveway at Aberdeen's Municipal Building. Aberdeen Township's Municipal Building is located at 1 Aberdeen Square, which is right off of Church Street. Seedlings will be available on a first come, first served basis. Each seedling comes with instructions on how to store, care for, and plant the trees. The guides help residents choose the right place on a property to plant a tree while keeping in mind the tree's full-grown size in the future. Residents should plant the seedlings within two days after pick-up in order to prevent the roots from drying out.
The goal of the Tree Recovery Campaign is to distribute over 600,000 tree seedlings to New Jersey residents over the course of six years was met last year. With natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy, and the damage caused by several new invasive insects to New Jersey, our state needs more new tree seedlings than ever before. Therefore, the campaign is moving into its 7th year. The program is a joint effort between Aberdeen Township, New Jersey Forest Service, New Jersey Soil Conservation Districts, Sustainable Jersey, Arbor Day Foundation, FedEx, and International Paper.
When properly planted and maintained, trees can be assets to a community. They improve the visual appeal of a neighborhood or business district, increase property values, reduce home cooling costs, remove air pollutants, and provide wildlife habitat, among many other benefits.
The 67,150 trees planted last year will reduce carbon dioxide by 87,064 tons, reduce non-carbon dioxide air pollution by 379 tons, save $12,024,729 in energy costs, and intercept 1,444,796,059 gallons of rainfall.

Central New Jersey's longtime congressman, Frank Pallone, Jr., a Democrat, will seek to hold onto his seat. He is facing two Democratic challengers in the upcoming primary, pushed back to July 7.
Pallone represents New Jersey's sixth congressional district, which stretches from Woodbridge down to Asbury Park, and includes Bayshore towns like Matawan and Hazlet. Pallone has represented this area in Congress since 1993 and is considered one of New Jersey's leading Democrat voices. He is a regular critic of President Trump.
There are no Republicans running against Pallone in 2020. But he does face a challenge from within his own party: The two Democrats running against him this year are Russell ""Russ"" Cirincione and Amani Al-Khatahtbeh. Both are far left progressives running in the vein of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Cirincione describes himself as a ""New Deal Democrat,"" who supports Universal Basic Income ($1,000 a month per adult and $500 per child), the Green New Deal and universal healthcare, in the form of Medicare for All, according to his campaign website.
He is a government housing litigation attorney and 2013 Seton Hall Law School grad.
Al-Khatahtbeh, 27, is a Rutgers grad and founder and editor-in-chief of MuslimGirl.com, a popular news and opinion site about Muslim womanhood in the U.S. She is also a supporter of Medicare for All, student loan forgiveness and says she wants to continue Sanders' movement. Al-Khatahtbeh is also a supporter of the Green New Deal; while at Rutgers, she was part of a student-led movement to push the university to divest from fossil fuels.
She has said she counts Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as among her role models.
The 2020 primary election has been postponed from June 2 to July 7, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
""NJ 6"" stretches from Carteret and Woodbridge into Edison, Metuchen, New Brunswick and down to Asbury Park. It hugs the Bayshore coastline, including towns such as Aberdeen, Matawan, Hazlet, part of Middletown, Atlantic Highlands and Highlands, Sea Bright and West Long Branch. Marlboro Township is also in the district.
Pallone was challenged in 2018 for the Congress seat by Rich Pezzullo, a proudly-Trump supporting Republican who hoped to identify with fellow Trump-supporters in the area.
Like many before him, Pezzullo was unsuccessful in his attempt to topple Pallone."

ABERDEEN, NJ - June 24, 2020 - Aberdeen Township's Mayor and Council announced today that
the annual Independence Day fireworks show will be postponed to the evening of Aberdeen

The annual town-wide celebration, scheduled to take place on Saturday, Sept. 26, will feature the much-anticipated fireworks show, if permitted by the state regulations regarding gatherings.
""The decision to postpone our annual fireworks show from July 2nd to September 26th was difficult. But given the popularity of this event and the Governor's current order regarding outdoor crowd sizes, we didn't want to have to turn people away,"" said Mayor Fred Tagliarini. ""We're hopeful that by the time late-September rolls around, outdoor attendance limits will be considerably higher, allowing us to safely cap off Aberdeen Day's daytime events with a spectacular show that all can see.""

Patch asked all the candidates to fill out this same questionnaire and here are Gunn's answers: (Here are Esposito's and Saggese's answers: https://patch.com/new-jersey/m...) Buckel did not respond.
Deana Gunn
Age (as of Election Day): 46
Position Sought: Councilperson
Party Affiliation: Democrat
Family: Husband Todd 48, son Tyler 15, daughter Lyla 12
Does anyone in your family work in politics or government? No
Education: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration
Occupation: I've been on the Matawan town council since 2018. Previously I was a health coach and small-business owner from 2014-2017. Prior to that I worked in finance for a large financial institution from 1997-2004.
Previous or Current Elected or Appointed Office? Currently elected at a Councilwoman in the Borough of Matawan
Campaign website: Restorematawan.com
Why are you seeking elective office? There are many accomplishments I'm proud of from my first term. We've repaired roads, fixed up parks and restored historic landmarks. We've removed eyesores like the two abandoned gas stations on Main Street. We've laid the foundation for infrastructure repairs and upgrades that will allow us to take the next step in developing our downtown and train station. We are working with the businesses and people that are interested in investing in Matawan. We are on our way but we still have more work to do.
Matawan taxpayers deserve a downtown they are proud of and a community with services and amenities for them to enjoy. I hope the residents give me the opportunity to continue with the team that has a vision of a restored Matawan and will continue to get things done.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it:
Due to the COVID crisis, the single most pressing issue facing our community right now is supporting our local economy. We've been in touch with our businesses so they are aware of any state and federal support. We are listening to what they need. Since dining outside is something that will help restaurant owners get back on their feet, we've waived the fees for outdoor dining permits and streamlined the process to make it easier.
Along those lines we need to continue working to enhance our downtown and transit area to bring in new businesses and customers. That isn't possible without the work that's been done over the last few years, newly paved roads, new sidewalks, the demolition of the two abandoned gas stations one in the downtown on Main Street and the other by the train station. The work we are doing will help existing businesses stay open and will bring in new businesses and commercial ratables. This will help to keep property taxes stable for homeowners for years to come.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I'm proud of the progress we have made to restore Matawan and the people I talk to are very happy with the improvements we have made as well. Also, our team has a vision and a real plan for Matawan going forward. During times like these I think it's important to have Council members with a record of getting things done. The only thing I have seen from our opponents is a lot of negativity and attacks on the work we've been doing the last few years.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency):
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform:
As a resident of this town for 20 years, I've always believed Matawan had a ton of potential and we have made more progress in the last five years than the 15 before that. Our goal has always been to give taxpayers a return on their tax dollars through parks to enjoy with their families, a downtown they are proud of and a community with services and amenities.
We've done this by fixing up what was neglected, restoring our historic sites, providing our departments with the necessary equipment they need to do their jobs and service the borough. We've fixed or improved much of our infrastructure. These steps were necessary to make Matawan a place where people want to invest. Now we've laid the foundation to take the town to the next level with our downtown and train station area. It's time to continue pushing forward.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
In the 10 years before we were elected, the previous administration let the town fall apart. Our team fixed it up. We refurbished neglected parks, restored historic sites, put in new sidewalks, fixed old infrastructure. Most recently we've worked with the county to pave two of our main roads in our downtown. Because of this we are now ready to tackle the next phase, which will be further redevelopment of the downtown and the train station.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
The best advice and the thing I always go back to is 'focus on the people that are counting on you, not the ones trying to bring you down.'
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I've been a resident for twenty years and I love my community. I think the key question that voters need to ask is themselves, is Matawan in a better place than it was four years ago?
The primary election has been pushed back to July 7. The general election is Tuesday, Nov. 3."

Why are you seeking elective office? I have been serving as the Monmouth County Clerk for the past five years. It is my great honor to serve the residents of Monmouth County as one of the four County Constitutional Officers. I have always had a passion for public service, and have held roles in public service throughout my life both in a professional and volunteer capacity.
Since becoming Clerk, I have been dedicated to better serving the residents of Monmouth County with the implementation of new and improved government services, as well as the overall modernization of the County Clerk's Office. I would like to continue this work and build on the progress I have made thus far. I would be honored to be re-elected by the residents of Monmouth County to serve as Monmouth County Clerk for another five-year term.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The most pressing issue facing our community is the coronavirus pandemic. Not only are we facing a health crisis of a highly contagious virus, but also the devastating effects to our community that the stay at home restrictions have caused. Throughout this crisis my office was at the forefront of providing key information and resources to the community. We created a central web page for official government notifications relating to closures, curfews, and updates about government operations in Monmouth County so our residents could keep up to date with the rapidly evolving situation. In addition, we continued our property recording operation so that residents could continue their real estate transactions during the pandemic, and we found innovative ways to still be able to provide other services. I will continue to find ways to help our residents get through this crisis.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
My experience as an attorney, a Commissioner on the Monmouth County Board of Elections and as County Clerk for the past five years makes me uniquely qualified for this position. Prior to being elected as County Clerk, I practiced law for over 20 years, focusing my legal practice, most recently, on government affairs and municipal law. As a former Commissioner on the Monmouth County Board of Elections, serving as Secretary for two years, I developed a full understanding of the election process and the issues involved with effectuating free and fair elections. My past five years of service as County Clerk have educated me as to all of the issues and requirements of running the Office of the County Clerk.
I am also involved in many organizations throughout the County, giving me a broad perspective as to the needs of our community. I currently serve as the Vice Chair of the Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), working closely with the SPCA Board of Trustees and leadership to ensure that the SPCA is able to provide a safe haven for animals while they await adoption, veterinary care, as well as advocate for the shelter and its animals. I am also on the Executive Board of the Monmouth County Bar Association and a Trustee for the Monmouth County Bar Foundation. I also serve as a Trustee for the Monmouth Council of Boy Scouts and as Secretary for the Constitutional Officers Association of New Jersey.
My background in law enforcement, as an assistant county prosecutor in Bronx, N.Y. and more recently as a municipal prosecutor in Monmouth County, also demonstrates that I support the law enforcement and first responder community, and will always work to support those who put themselves in harm's way for the good of the community.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency):
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform: My campaign is about providing the highest quality and most accessible services to our Monmouth County residents. Since becoming County Clerk, I have initiated many programs to better serve the public, and to make the public more aware of our services.
I created a new website for the Monmouth County Clerk's Office with a focus on customer navigation and better access to the public. In addition, since the County Clerk also serves as the Clerk of Elections for the County of Monmouth, I created a voter education website, MonmouthCountyVotes.com, in conjunction with the two other Monmouth County Election Offices. The elections website is a one-stop shop for voters and candidates to access election information, and includes an ""Election Night Reporting"" website to provide election results online in real-time. I also created the ""Monmouth County Votes"" Mobile App providing elections information and deadlines, including push notification reminders. In addition, I initiated the ""Your Vote Matters"" Program through which I visit local high schools to educate students about voting and encourage young people to be involved in the democratic process.
To support our veterans in the county, I also created the ""Honoring our Heroes"" Military Appreciation Program, which encourages local businesses to offer special services to Monmouth County's veterans and Gold Star parents. The program provides a way for local businesses to honor our veterans and Gold Star parents, and to in-turn, give them the ability to receive valuable discounts. Since initiating the program in 2015, the ""Honoring our Heroes"" program has expanded to include hundreds of stores, restaurants, and other businesses within the county.
In coordination with Sheriff Shaun Golden and Surrogate Rosemarie Peters, I launched the first-ever Mobile County Connection to bring the government services from their respective offices directly to the people, by visiting various libraries, communities, and municipalities throughout the County. I also worked with Golden and Peters to open a Mobile County Connection storefront at the Monmouth Mall which serves as a satellite office and is open on the first Thursday of each month.
In an effort to help combat the effects of property fraud, I implemented the Property Fraud Alert service which is a free subscription service that allows Monmouth County property owners to have their name/property monitored within the Recording Division of the Monmouth County Clerk's Office, in order to track possibly fraudulent activity. Subscribers are then notified when the name they have submitted to the alert system is used in any recording activities within the office.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
One of the most important qualifications for this position is strong leadership. Throughout my life, I have held many leadership positions and have been recognized by various organizations in this regard. These awards include: 2020 Women of Distinction Award from the Girl Scouts of the Jersey Shore; 2020 Woman of History from the New Jersey Daughters of the American Revolution; 2019 Silver Gull Award for Government Leadership from the Monmouth-Ocean Development Council; 2018 Person of the Year Award from the Monmouth County Fraternal Order of Police, Superior Officer's Lodge #30; 2017 Spinnaker Award for Public Service from the Eastern Monmouth Area Chamber of Commerce; 2005 ""Outstanding Chamber Service Award"" from the Greater Ocean Twp. Chamber of Commerce; 2004 Young Lawyers' from the Monmouth Bar Association.
The best advice ever shared with me was: ""Always do your best and the rest will take care of itself.""
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
During my tenure as Clerk, I have sought to provide our wonderful residents of Monmouth County with the highest quality of service. I believe my record as Clerk, including the many new initiatives I have spearheaded, show that I am dedicated to the position and will always try to think of new ideas to better serve the public.
The primary election has been pushed back to July 7; the general election is in November."

It hugs the Bayshore coastline, including towns such as Aberdeen, Matawan, Hazlet, part of Middletown, Atlantic Highlands and Highlands, Sea Bright and West Long Branch. Marlboro Township is also in the district.
Pallone has represented this area in Congress since 1993 and is considered one of New Jersey's leading Democrat voices. He is a regular critic of President Trump.
Both Cirincione and Amani are far-left progressives running in the vein of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Cirincione describes himself as a ""New Deal Democrat,"" who supports Universal Basic Income ($1,000 a month per adult and $500 per child), the Green New Deal and universal healthcare, in the form of Medicare for All, according to his campaign website.

Al-Khatahtbeh is also a supporter of the Green New Deal; while at Rutgers, she was part of a student-led movement to push the university to divest from fossil fuels.
She has said she counts Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as among her role models.

Aberdeen Paves the Way for Outdoor Dining
ABERDEEN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (6/9/20)—The Aberdeen Township Council today announced that the municipality is now issuing temporary use permits for outdoor dining for restaurants with an active Food Handlers license that currently do not have approved outdoor dining, or wish to expand already approved outdoor sections. The move comes in tandem with new state rules that paved the way for outdoor dining to commence on June 15, at which time 'non-essential' retailers can re-open with enforced social distancing.
Created in consultation with the Aberdeen Economic Business Council (EBC), the permit guidelines are designed to encourage appropriate social distancing in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), State of New Jersey and Monmouth County Health Departments, and in conformance with State and Local Executive Orders. Permit holders must also comply with sanitation and infection control guidelines specified under New Jersey Executive Directive No. 20-014 that provides COVID-19 protocols for outdoor dining service.
The temporary permits will remain in effect until October 31, 2020, unless extended by Aberdeen Township. The permit application can be obtained by contacting Paula Ramsay of the Building Department at: paula.ramsay@aberdeennj.org. The state's outdoor dining protocols will be attached to the application.
""While many of our restaurants have done a brisk take-out business during the pandemic, others also want to offer their loyal patrons the option to safely 'eat out' again,"" said Mayor Fred Tagliarini. ""The outdoor dining rules provide a good interim step in advance of any future move by the state to allow indoor seating. Our Building Department will do everything possible to expedite the permit process for applicants.""

2020 Summer Concert Series
Aberdeen residents will once again have the opportunity to jam out for the rest of the summer on Tuesdays at Veterans Memorial Park in Cliffwood Beach thanks to the township's annual Summer Concert Series. Shows will take place each Tuesday from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Residents are encouraged to bring their coolers with food and drinks, blankets, chairs and bug spray. There will be no concert on August 4. The beachside concert series kicked off July 7th with ""Parrot Beach,"" a well-known Jimmy Buffett tribute band. The night was such a success that Aberdeen has decided to move forward with the rest of the summer lineup. Next up on July 14 will be a seven-piece local band called ""Madison Avenue"" that promises to have a song in its repertoire for everyone. The group's three lead singers will rock the house with a variety of music. You won't want to miss Sammy, Dino and Frank on July 21, as ""The Rat Pack Track Show"" cover band performs some of the most iconic '60s standards. The jam-packed lineup then showcases ""Southern Steel,"" a local southern classic rock band, on July 28. A popular returning act from last year, this Southern rock tribute band will perform songs by the Allman Bros., Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet and many more. ""Random Test Reggae Band"" is up next to kick off the start of the series in August on the 11th. For over a decade, the band has been rocking the Jersey Shore with music heavily coated in Caribbean traditions. And last but certainly not least will be ""40 North Country"" on August 25, which will play everything from today's country hits to the classics. If you are a country music fan, a line dancing lover or just looking for a fun way to end the summer, ""40 North"" is right up your alley. ""Our Summer Concert Series is an event that I look forward to each year. We are happy to once again bring the excellent programming to our residents,"" said Aberdeen Public Information Officer Brittany Shea. Families are asked to socially distance and when 6 ft. cannot be maintained to mask up. Please be sure to check the Aberdeen website (www.aberdeennj.org) or Facebook page for updates.

Please note that colored paint and flags may be appearing on the trees and along the roadway and sidewalk. These marks indicate the presence of important underground utilities. Please do not remove these flags or attempt to remove the marks.
Every effort will be made to minimize any inconvenience during construction. The Township's Consulting Engineer, CME Associates, will have representatives in the area while the work takes place. If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to approach one of these representatives or to contact Mr. Paulo Benatti of CME Associates at 732-727-8000 x1217.
Thank you for your anticipated cooperation during these improvements.

8/7/2020 - A Message from Mayor Fred Tagliarini Regarding Power Outages
Good Morning Aberdeen,
This is our third power outage update message. This morning, the Township Manager and I were on call with our JCP&L representative, advising us that 29% of Aberdeen is still without power. We all continue to work diligently to emphasize the urgency of getting Aberdeen residents restored.
JCP&L provided the following schedule of restoration: Currently, 2,344 customers are without power. They expect 1,136 customers to be restored today, and 556 customers to be restored on Saturday, August 8th. We have a totally of 10 damaged circuits.
Please be reminded to stay clear of any downed wires, even those believed to be no longer electrified as they could become re-energized during the restoration process. If there are any downed wires that you believe have yet to be reported, first notify the Police Department at 732-566-2054 and then report the downed wire to JCP&L at 1-888-544-4877.
We also were able to get an update regarding cable service providers. Altice/Optimum and Verizon have informed us that their crews are out, and working around the clock to restore service in impacted areas. Please note that electrical power is needed to operate cable and internet services. Verizon stated that if you are Fios customer your phone line will continue to work, as long as there is not a physical cut of the fiber, due to battery backup. If electricity to your home or business location has been restored and you are still unable to access Optimum services, it could be because the power that feeds the network in your area comes from a different commercial power source than the power that feeds your home or business location. Or, restoring your service may require repairs (such as damage caused from downed trees and fiber cuts during a storm), even down to the connection between your home and the nearest utility pole. Altice/Optimum and Verizon technicians often cannot begin work until the power company completes their repairs, so customers may experience some lag time between when power is restored and their cable/internet services are restored. Any Altice/Optimum customers without cable should contact them by calling their customer service line at 973-230-6048, please keep in mind the volume of calls is currently higher than most times, it may take a few tries to get through. Any Verizon customers without service should contact them by calling 1-800-837-4966.
As a reminder the George Hausmann building, located at 30 Noble Place, is open as a charging/cooling station for residents. The building will be open on Friday, August 7th until 4:30 pm. If a charging/cooling station is needed over the weekend, we ask that you contact the Police Department at 732-566-2054.
Please know that on behalf of the Council, the Township Manager, Chief of Police, we all understand your frustrations and will continue to contact JCP&L until we have everyone in Aberdeen restored. We thank you for your patience in this matter.
Sincerely,
Fred Tagliarini
Mayor

8/6/2020 - Message from Mayor Tagliarini Regarding Restoration
Dear Aberdeen Residents,
On behalf of the Council, Town Manager and the Chief of Police, I hope that you are staying safe. I realize that for most of you, frustration levels are high, please know we are in contact with JCP&L. Yesterday at 3:00pm, Aberdeen was on a conference call with JCP&L. I again have the unpleasant task of reminding you that the restoration period will be a "" Multi Day Task"". We were informed that the estimated restoration time for the most severe cases is by 11:30 pm on August 11. As of this morning, Aberdeen went from having 80% of the town without power to 39% of Aberdeen experiencing outages. Please be aware that even though we are monitoring the situation with JCP&L, we are unfortunately, not always notified with updates in a timely manner. This morning, a transformer blew on Van Brackle Road, which disrupted service to Highway 34 and some of you that had already been restored. As of now, most of the impacted area has been or is in the process of being restored. We will continue to pressure JCP&L to restore the power in Aberdeen and we will continue to update you as much as we can.
Below is a list of numbers that I believe you will find to be resourceful.
Police Department: 732-566-2054
Town Hall: 732-583-4200
To report an outage to JCP&L : 1-888-544-4877
Text STAT to 544487 or call 888-544-4877 to receive an update for your specific outage. This personalized information is also available in your online account.
Please stay safe and reach out to us in any emergency.
Sincerely,
Fred Tagliarini
Mayor

I need my ballot mailed to a mailing address that is not my home residence. How can I change my mailing address?
To change the mailing address for which your ballot will be mailed, please complete a Vote by Mail Ballot Application. In Section 4 of the application clearly print the mailing address as to where to mail your ballot to. Vote by Mail Applications sent by mail must be received by the Monmouth County Clerk's Elections Office by October 23, 2020.

Be advised that if a VBM Application is received too close to Election Day, time may not permit the application to be cured to allow the voter to receive a VBM Ballot by mail.

Who counts the ballots?
The County Board of Elections counts the ballots. The Board of Elections is overseen by Commissioners who represent the two major political parties. In Monmouth County, the Board of Elections is overseen by three Republicans and three Democrats.
Do all VBM Ballots get counted?
Ballots that are properly cast are counted by the County Board of Elections. Two common errors causing ballots to be rejected are: 1. neglecting to sign the Certification, and 2. the tampering of the Certificate of Mail-in Voter. Do Not Detach the Certificate and attempt to tape it. If your Certificate is detached or damaged, request a new Certificate by contacting the County Clerk's Election Office at 732-431-7790.
Will I be notified if my VBM ballot is rejected?
YES. The Board of Elections will notify you of the reason why your ballot was not counted.
Voting at the Polls on November 3, 2020 Frequently Asked Questions
How will I know where my polling place will be located?
The Board of Elections will be choosing a limited number of Polling Places available for voters on Election Day, where only Provisional Paper Ballots will be available for voting unless the voter is disabled. A Provisional Paper Ballot is similar to voting on your VBM Ballot, but is counted after all the mail-in ballots are counted. You will be receiving a post card notifying you of the polling location in your municipality. The Board of Elections has until September 15th to certify the polling locations.
Will I be receiving a Sample Ballot?
NO, because this is a primarily vote by mail election, you will be receiving a VBM ballot, which will be the ballot that you will cast your vote. Samples of the mail-in ballot will be available by mid-September on the County Clerk's website at www.MonmouthCountyVotes.com to view and will be available at the polling location.
Monmouth County 2020 General Election Frequently Asked Questions for the November 3 General Election
6
Will I be permitted to vote in-person on a voting machine if I go to my polling place?
Only disabled voters will be permitted to vote on voting machines on election day. All other voters will be given paper provisional ballots.
A Provisional Paper Ballot is similar to voting on your VBM Ballot, except that it must be verified after the election and is counted only after all of the mail-in ballots are counted.
We urge you to use your VBM Ballot, as Provisional Ballots are counted last and must be checked against the VBM Ballots that have already been cast before they are accepted and canvassed.
Do all provisional ballots get counted?
ALL provisional paper ballots that are properly cast are canvassed and counted, after all of the mail-in ballots are counted.
Will I be notified if my provisional ballot is rejected?
YES. The Board of Elections will notify you of the reason why your ballot was not counted.
How will I vote if I am disabled and require an accessible ballot?
If you have a disability and need an accessible ballot for voting at home, please contact the Monmouth County Clerk's Office at 732-431-7790 or you may go to your assigned General Election polling place, which will provide access to an in-person accessible voting device on General Election Day.
When will we know the results of the November 3, 2020 General Election?
Due to the challenges of this unprecedented election process and the time allotted to receive ballots and counted by the Board of Elections, the results may not be available on election night. Every effort will be made to provide results as quickly as possible. The Governor's Executive Order gives the County Board of Elections until November 20, 2020 to count the ballots.

ABERDEEN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (9/04/20)—Aberdeen Township today announced that it will be cancelling the 2020 edition of its annual Aberdeen Day event, which had been scheduled for September 26.
""It saddens me to announce to the residents of Aberdeen and surrounding towns, that we must cancel our largest and most popular event,"" said Mayor Fred Tagliarini. ""This town-wide celebration has steadily grown over the years, and now draws thousands of attendees. But in this time of COVID-19, it would be wrong to invite that many families to our town, creating an unsafe environment for our Police, Fire Department and other First Responders, along with other township employees, volunteers, vendors and guests.""
He added: ""In 2021, Aberdeen Day will return with our full schedule to celebrate our great town. We look forward to seeing all of you next year.""

61,/new-jersey/matawan-aberdeen/battle-open-sober-living-home-matawan,2020-09-30T15:52:26Z,Group Tries To Open Matawan Sober Living Home,0,0,Carly Baldwin,Patch Staff,"MATAWAN, NJ — A Monmouth County brother-sister team seeks to open a 10-person sober living home on Shainy Lane in Matawan, but the town rejected their initial application, saying it violates local zoning laws.
Matawan Administrator Scott Carew said the town has nothing against a sober living home; it's just that the number of tenants who would be living on the property exceeds residential zoning laws.
The group that wants to open the home is CFC Recovery, an addiction recovery program based out of Farmingdale. CFC Recovery is run by Daniel Regan and his sister, Ashley Regan.
In August, CFC put in a zoning application to the Matawan construction/zoning office to rent out the Shainy Lane property, and convert it into a sober living facility. They said in their application 10 residents would be living there.
""Because the proposed use would violate Matawan's local zoning ordinances, the application was denied,"" said Carew. ""It is my understanding that the number of residents they were proposing to house at this site would have been at least double the amount of residents allowed in a group home in this residential zone.""
Carew said the town of Matawan checked with the state, specifically the Department of Community Affairs Bureau of Rooming and Boarding House Standards, which issues licenses for such facilities. He said the state confirmed the town's rejection.
""Having 10 tenants in a rental home would put the property in a different occupancy class for a residential unit,"" said Carew. ""That classification is not permitted in our R-100 residential zone. A sober living home must comply with local zoning ordinances. So there is no battle that Matawan is participating in. Certainly not against the idea of sober living homes.""
Carew also said there already exists similar rehab facilities in Matawan ""without any issues."" He also said he emailed the CFC executive director, saying he ""would be more than happy to help you and CFC with your efforts.""
""We're not going to stop fighting,"" countered Ashley Regan.
""This is a classic case of not in my backyard; people don't want someone in recovery in their backyard. Unfortunately we've encountered this age-old stigma many, many times before. There are a lot of state laws that townships are not aware of.""
She said she could not immediately say how many residents would be living in the home because ""it depends what kind of license we get from the state.""
Daniel Regan, 29 — who was interviewed in this article about drug relapses skyrocketing during the lockdown — beat heroin addiction himself. He founded CFC (Coming Full Circle) Recovery with his mom, Lynn Regan, and currently runs five sober living facilities in Monmouth and Ocean counties. It is his life's mission to help others stop using drugs.
CFC has been working with Matwan residents Marianne and Claude Thouret Jr, whose son Justin died of a heroin overdose at the age of 31. CFC has already been holding weekly support group meetings for recovering addicts at the Freneau fire house in Matawan.
""There's a reason we're in Matawan. They asked us to come,"" said Regan. ""These are longtime Matawan residents; she taught in the Matawan school district for thirty years.
""They offered to rent their house on Shainy Lane to us. They would move out, and those in recovery would move in and live there full time, along with a live-in house manager and peer support specialists on staff coming in every day.""
The Thouret home is only a few blocks away on Shainy Lane and it would serve as a base for men and women who are in the last steps of their recovery from drug/alcohol addiction.
""These are people who are in the final stages of recovery,"" explained Regan. ""They've gone through treatment, they've stopped using drugs. They are now just working to get their lives — and often their kids — back.""
""We already have a wait list to get in,"" she continued. ""These people are 22 to 32 years old, the majority are from Monmouth County. They go to work from 9-5, and then a recovery meeting at 7 and then on weekends we have a whole list of activities for them to do. That's been their life for the past two years. It's very structured.""
CFC residents already volunteer at Matawan park clean-ups and such around the borough on weekends.
To live at the home, you must have a full-time job and attend recovery meetings. Drug screening is done every day and if a person has been found to relapse, they are kicked out of the home, she said. Also, registered sex offenders are not allowed to live there.
Heroin addiction is high in all of Monmouth County, but the Bayshore area, from Matawan to Sandy Hook, has been particularly hard hit.
""There is nowhere else for them to go; their families don't want them back right now,"" said Regan. ""We are fighting a very old, old stigma and it's never easy. I wish people would say, Please, come in and help our communities. If it doesn't happen at Shainy, it will happen somewhere else. We'll make it happen. We will continue to fight for these people.""

Ballot drop boxes are collected and returned directly to the Monmouth County Board of Elections office. These ballots are only handled by designated Board of Elections representatives.
Gov. Murphy ordered that the Nov. 3 presidential election be vote by mail in New Jersey, due to COVID fears.
Expect to start getting your ballots mailed to you soon. All registered voters can deposit their completed mail-in ballot in a drop box by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3 at the following locations:
And if you do not want to mail in your mail-in ballot, you can also vote at your assigned place on Nov. 3, Election Day. But even then you will only be able to vote by paper ballot-marking device and not by machine.
There will no voting machines in New Jersey this fall.
""Regardless of the state-mandated changes, it is essential to have your vote counted for the general election,"" said Freeholder Lillian Burry, liaison to the Board of Elections. ""On November 3, there will be limited in-person polling locations with only paper ballots available. Because of the State mandates, residents will need to utilize the 17 mail-in ballot drop boxes throughout the County to deposit your mail-in ballot."""

All were officially sworn in Wednesday in a ceremony outside Town Hall.
Geyer, whose promotion was effective July 1, was appointed second-in-command by Township Manager Bryan Russell to fill the position that had been vacant after Rick Derechailo was promoted to chief in January 2019.
Geyer has served in numerous capacities since joining the Aberdeen Police Department in 1987, including six years in the Detective Bureau, followed by an assignment to Traffic Safety as Traffic Sergeant.
His promotion created a domino effect of promotions of veteran officers within the department, with Matthew Lloyd named Captain, Craig Hausmann appointed Lieutenant, and Raymond Campbell elevated to Sergeant. Their promotions were effective September 1.
Lloyd is an 18-year veteran of the department who served for three years in the Bayshore Narcotics Task Force and in the Aberdeen Police Department's traffic division. In 2018, he was promoted to Lieutenant and assigned as Patrol Commander in the Operations Division.
Hausmann joined the department on Sept. 1, 2001 and has served as its instructor in the Law Enforcement Against Drugs (L.E.A.D.) program. He was promoted to Sergeant and assigned to the Patrol Division in 2018.
Campbell is a 14-year veteran of the department, joining as a dispatcher shortly after graduating high school. During his time in the department, he has served as firearms instructor and was selected to serve on the Monmouth County Rapid Deployment Force.
The three newly hired officers (who all live in Aberdeen) are Andrew Gioia, Liam Gallagher and Thomas Wagner. They were immediately assigned to the Patrol Division. All are replacing recently retired officers.
Gioia, 26, earned a bachelor's degree from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and previously worked as a police officer at Brookdale Community College. He has also serves as a volunteer fireman with the Aberdeen Township Hose and Chemical Co.
Gallagher, 23, earned a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Scranton and was employed as a special law enforcement officer in the Keansburg Police Department. Wagner, 25, graduated in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Kutztown University and served as a special law enforcement officer in the Sea Girt Police Department."

The ballot box is bolted to the ground outside Town Hall and under surveillance by a security camera monitored by the Aberdeen Police Department. Town Hall is located at 1 Aberdeen Square (Church St., just off Atlantic Ave.).
Employees with the Monmouth County Board of Elections will be collecting the ballots from that box every single day until 8 p.m. on November 3.
It is looking like using a ballot drop box will be one of the best ways to hand in your vote this fall: The ballots are collected daily and taken straight to the Board of Elections headquarters in Freehold. Three Aberdeen polling places (see below) will be open Nov. 3 but voting machines will only be open to disabled voters at the polls.
If you don't have a proven disability, you can vote at the polls using a paper provisional ballot only. Additionally, paper provisional ballots will be counted by each county's Board of Elections only after all mail-in ballots are counted.
Monmouth County installed 17 official ballot drop boxes, and Aberdeen was lucky to get one.
""This highly secure ballot box provides an excellent option for voters seeking an alternative to the Post Office,"" said Aberdeen Township Clerk Karen Ventura. ""Of course, for those who prefer to vote in person, using provisional (paper) ballot, we will offer the same three polling sites successfully utilized in the July primary.""
These three Aberdeen polling sites will be open from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 3:
For further information, contact Aberdeen Clerk Karen Ventura at: 732-583-4200, ext. 119
What you need to know about how to vote this fall, from the Monmouth County Clerk:
Dear Residents:
Recently, Governor Murphy signed a law changing the election process for the November 3, 2020 general election:
1. The election will now be conducted primarily by mail-in ballots. Ballots are being mailed to active Monmouth County voters with a postage paid return envelope.
2. There will be limited in-person polling locations open on Election Day. Voters who go to the polls will vote on provisional paper ballots.
3. There will be no voting machines, except for disabled voters. These voters can contact my office at 732-431-7790 for an accessible paper ballot.
4. Any voter who does not receive a mail-in ballot by October 13, or who misplaces or damages the ballot, can call 732-431-7790 or visit us in person at 300 Halls Mill Road, Freehold.
County Election Officials are encouraging voters to return their completed mail-in ballot early either by USPS mail, secure drop box, in-person at the Board of Elections, 300 Halls Mill Road Freehold, or by dropping off at their polling place on Election Day.
Per State law, provisional ballots cast at the polls will be reviewed and counted after all mail-in ballots are counted. Therefore, voters who go to the polls are advised to bring and drop off their mail-in ballot. A voter may only bring his or her own mail-in ballot to a polling location.

In the race for Matawan Borough Board, two incumbents were successful in holding onto their council positions, officially winning by the following margins:
As Patchpreviously reported, Gunn pointed to work the council has done restoring Matawan and developing its Main Street, downtown and the train station area — all of which costs money and investment.
""In the 10 years before we were elected, the previous administration let the town fall apart. Our team fixed it up. We've repaired roads, put in new sidewalks, fixed up parks and restored historic landmarks. We've removed eyesores like the two abandoned gas stations on Main Street.

The only thing I have seen from our opponents is a lot of negativity and attacks on the work we've been doing the last few years.""
Gunn promised if re-elected, the Democrat Matawan boro Council will ""tackle the next phase,"" further redevelopment of the downtown and train station area.

However, there are still 150,000 to 200,000 votes that have not been counted, according to County Clerk Christine Hanlon, meaning it is too early to establish a winner in any race in Monmouth County.
The Matawan Republican challenger, Anissa Esposito, criticized this year's voting process. She said Gov. Murphy's mandate to vote by mail slowed down ballot counting across the state.
""The fact that voters in most of New Jersey, will not know the final results of our elections for at least several more days is unconscionable,"" said Esposito. ""We are frustrated with the Governor's mostly vote-by-mail mandate, which stripped voters of their fundamental right to go into a private voting booth, cast their vote and learn the results on Election Day.""
""This flawed mandate also caused undue (strain) on voters, strain on the USPS and our County Board of Elections. We applaud the incredible work of our County Clerk Christine Hanlon and the Board of Elections to meet this unprecedented challenge. We are especially grateful to all of the people working to process hundreds of thousands of ballots as carefully and quickly as possible. We remain cautiously optimistic as we await the final results later this week.""
County Clerk Hanlon, also a Republican, said she and a bipartisan coalition of county clerks told Murphy earlier this year they disagreed with his vote-by-mail mandate.
""I'm still very upset that the governor did that, and I think most voters were upset by the mandate,"" Hanlon told Patch. ""Because we're not going to have results for weeks. The change caused a massive strain on the infrastructure and it was a strain on resources. If we were on machines it would have been done already.""
Matawan boro Council results as of 4:06 p.m Wednesday:
Deana GUNN, Democrat, 1,436 votes
Stephanie BUCKEL, Democrat, 1,419 votes
Anissa Esposito, Republican, 940 votes
Joe Saggese, Republican, 913 votes

""I know they are still counting so we are optimistic and grateful for the numbers we are seeing so far, but will wait for the votes to finish being counted,"" said Gunn.
These are not all the votes. If you mailed your ballot back on Election Day, it still has to be counted; if you voted provisionally at the polls, it still has to be counted and ADA-machine votes are still pending.
In the Matawan borough council race, Republicans Anissa Esposito and Joe Saggese tried to unseat Gunn and Buckel.

Republicans have been trying for years without success to make inroads on the Matawan borough council, dominated by Democrats. Esposito and Saggese made a ballooning municipal budget their No. 1 issue.
""The current administration ran on making Matawan more affordable, yet raised the budget by 20 percent in five years,"" said Esposito in this Patch profile. ""In fact, while it is nice to see a rehabilitated historic mansion or new curbs and sidewalks on Main Street, not a whole lot has really changed in five years, except out-of-control spending and debt. This administration chose to raise the budget by $450,000, make no cuts or consolidations, quietly introduce a $11.9-million dollar bond offering, and raise municipal taxes $600,000.""
Saggese said he ran because of a lack of transparency from the borough council.
""Residents have been bullied and intimidated by the council,"" he said. ""They have driven debt and spending to unsurpassed levels.""
But Gunn pointed to work the council has done restoring Matawan and developing its Main Street, downtown and the train station area — all of which costs money and investment.
""In the 10 years before we were elected, the previous administration let the town fall apart. Our team fixed it up.

Republicans have been trying for years without success to make inroads on the Matawan borough council, long dominated by Democrats.
Esposito served on the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional Board of Education for nine years, and she is active in the Monmouth County Republican party.
She and Saggese point to a ballooning municipal budget for their No. 1 issue for why they wanted the Dems voted out.
""The current administration ran on making Matawan more affordable, yet raised the budget by 20 percent in five years,"" said Esposito in this Patch profile. ""While it is nice to see a rehabilitated historic mansion or new curbs and sidewalks on Main Street, not a whole lot has really changed in five years, except out-of-control spending and debt. Matawan was the fourth-highest taxed municipality in 2019 ... and this administration chose to raise the budget by $450,000, make no cuts or consolidations, quietly introduce a $11.9-million dollar bond offering, and raise municipal taxes $600,000.""
Saggese, a union worker with the Port of NY & NJ, also said he wanted to reduce Matawan's debt and spending, and also pointed to what he says is a lack of transparency from the borough council.
""Residents have been bullied and intimidated by the council,"" he said. ""They have driven debt and spending to unsurpassed levels.""
But incumbent Gunn, who is Council president, points to success under this current council, such as repairing sidewalks, roads, town parks and encouraging new residential development around the Matawan-Aberdeen train station.
""In the 10 years before we were elected, the previous administration let the town fall apart. Our team fixed it up,"" she said, in her profile on why she seeks re-election.
Gunn pointed to work the council has done restoring Matawan and developing its Main Street, downtown and the train station area — all of which costs money and investment.
""We've repaired roads, put in new sidewalks, fixed up parks and restored historic landmarks. We've removed eyesores like the two abandoned gas stations on Main Street. We are on our way but we still have more work to do,"" she said. ""Our team has a vision and a real plan for Matawan going forward. The only thing I have seen from our opponents is a lot of negativity and attacks on the work we've been doing the last few years.""
Gunn promised if re-elected, the Democrat Matawan boro Council will ""tackle the next phase,"" further redevelopment of the downtown and the train station.
Here are past Patch profiles from all the candidates: Matawan Councilwoman Deana Gunn: Why I Seek Re-Election

Current council members Deana Gunn and Stephanie Buckel, both Democrats, seek to retain their seats. They are challenged by Republicans Anissa Esposito and Joe Saggese.
Esposito and Saggese talked to Patch about why they think it's time for Republicans to gain a foothold on the Matawan borough council (Here are Deana Gunn's answers: https://patch.com/new-jersey/m...):
Esposito previously served for nine years on the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional Board of Education (her term expired Dec. 31, 2019).
Position Sought: Matawan Borough council
Party Affiliation: Republican
Family: Husband and two adult children
Does anyone in your family work in politics or government? I am the new Municipal Republican Committee Chairwoman in Matawan
Education: Associate's degree in legal studies
Occupation: Paralegal specializing in research and investigation
Previous or Current Elected or Appointed Office: Matawan Aberdeen Regional School District Board of Education Member
Why are you seeking elective office? I have a passion for public service to my community
The single most pressing issue facing our community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it. Although there are several pressing issues in our community, the fiscal policies of the current Council administration have Matawan on an unsustainable path. Spending, taxes and debt are making our community unaffordable for seniors, families and young people starting out. I am committed to having a top-to-bottom audit of all spending, advocating aggressively for our fair share of state aid for our school district to help ease the unfair burden placed on our taxpayers for decades, and resist unnecessary borrowing, particularly when we have large surpluses every year.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post? The critical differences between me and the incumbents is that my running mate Joe Saggese and I are not beholden to anyone but the voters. Matawan residents need watchdogs on the Council who will serve them with honesty, transparency, accountability and respect. They deserve representatives who will look out for them and their tax dollars by reviewing every decision made, every contract and every penny spent.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)? The current administration ran on making Matawan more affordable, yet raised the budget by 20 percent in five years with little to show for it. In fact, while it is nice to see a rehabilitated historic mansion or new curbs and sidewalks on Main Street, not a whole lot has really changed in five years, except out-of-control spending and debt. Matawan was the fourth-highest taxed municipality in 2019. The current administration routinely blames the county or school district, yet the town tax rate has been higher than both for the past two years.
In a year when so many residents and businesses are struggling due to a near-total shutdown of our local and state economy for months on end, this administration chose to raise the budget by $450,000, make no cuts or consolidations, quietly introduce a $11.9-million dollar bond offering, and raise municipal taxes $600,000, resulting in staggering property tax increases for property owners. Our Main Street, which is important to residents, remains a struggling district of town after five years of promises to revitalize it.
In fact it seems the main plan for ""restoring Matawan"" is to fill the Downtown and transit area with large-scale residential development. I say ""it seems"" because they have only provided vague statements like ""working with investors"" and ""creating millions in ratables"" with no details, unless you read the revised Master Plan they approved in 2018. Residents should not have to play detective in order to know what their Council is doing!
We have a serious issue with a lack of transparency and respect for all residents in this administration, which creates a chilling affect on constituent's rightful questioning of their government. This needs to change!
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job? My experience as a longtime member of the Board of Education provided me with a great deal of knowledge and experience in how government works (or more precisely, should work). During my tenure, I served as negotiations chair and held leadership roles as president and vice president for most of that time. I understand the importance of stakeholder engagement in decision making. I have a thorough understanding of how government entity budgets work, as well as things like contracts and state funding, which greatly impact those budgets. I was an outspoken advocate for the school district and taxpayers regarding our fair share of state aid funding in Trenton, which has prepared me to continue being a strong advocate for the residents of Matawan. As a legal professional, I am conditioned to examine issues and facts from all sides, have a strong attention to detail, as well as how to anticipate potential issues that can arise and come up with solutions to address them. All are invaluable skills when serving in a local government organization such as Borough Council, in my opinion and I feel more than prepared to meet the challenge.
The best advice ever shared with me was: The best advice ever shared with me was to always trust your gut, never let anyone tell you that you can't achieve what you set your mind to, use their negativity as fuel to your fire and just do it. I have lived my whole life proving naysayers wrong.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions? I would like voters to know that I am passionate about Matawan, I am eager to have the opportunity to serve my neighbors and fellow community members.
Joseph Saggese

Party Affiliation: Republican
Family: Wife JoAnn and three sons Danny, Will & Mel

Why are you seeking elective office? I believe that a local government must represent all of the people with service and respect. This can only be done with diversity of opinion, diversity of thought and diversity of ideas.
The single most pressing issue facing our community is: A lack of respect from local government to residents that differ in political opinion.
And this is what I intend to do about it:
As stated in the above question a healthy government must have diversity of thought, ideas and opinions if all residents are to believe that they are being represented. When only one point of view is represented, that governing body has absolute power and absolute power corrupts absolutely. So what I intend to do is to listen to, respect and represent all residents regardless of their political affiliation. In a position of political power I represent the public interest, not my own.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post? We are not beholden to anyone but the voters. Matawan needs watchdogs on the council who will review every decision made, every contract signed and every penny spent.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)?
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform:
1. Respect for all residents of Matawan.
2. Open and transparent government.
3. Develop new shared services with the county and other towns.
4. Control debt and spending.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job? I have 25 years of experience in construction and the heating, air conditioning and ventilation industry. Fifteen of those 25 years were spent in the vocational education of young high school graduates and older adults who had lost their jobs and were coming to me for retraining. I gained the experience to greet younger adults with excitement for a new future while learning to be compassionate with the older person who was forced to make a mid-life career change.
The best advice ever shared with me was: ""When you take on a leadership role and you blame the person who's place you are taking, that is telling everyone that you don't know how to do the job.""
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions? I joined the New Jersey Army National Guard and was Honorably discharged 1980 - 1986.
Here are Deana Gunn's answers; she was asked by Patch the same set of questions: Matawan Councilwoman Deana Gunn: Why I Seek Re-Election Buckel did not get back to us.

10/22/2020
Aberdeen Township, NJ – On Saturday, Oct. 24, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. the Aberdeen Township Police Department and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will provide the public the opportunity to prevent pill abuse and theft by ridding their homes of potentially dangerous expired, unused and unwanted prescription drugs. Bring your pills for disposal to Town Hall at 1 Aberdeen Square. There will be an officer stationed out front to escort residents into the building one by in order to drop off their unwanted prescription drugs. Please be aware masks are required in order to enter the building. We cannot accept liquids, needles or sharps, only pills or patches. The service is free and anonymous, no questions asked.
This October event is DEA's 19th nationwide event since its inception 10 years ago.
Last fall, Americans turned in nearly 883,000 pounds of prescription drugs at nearly 6,300 sites operated by the DEA and almost 5,000 of its state and local law enforcement partners. DEA, along with its law enforcement partners, has now collected nearly 6,350 tons of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription medications since the inception of the National Prescription Drug Take Back Initiative in 2010.
To keep everyone safe, collection sites will follow local COVID-19 guidelines and regulations.
This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue. Medicines that languish in home cabinets are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse. Rates of prescription drug abuse in the United States are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses due to these drugs.
In addition to DEA's National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, there are many other ways to dispose of unwanted prescription drugs every day, including the 11,000 authorized collectors that are available all year long. For more information, visit DEA's year-round collection site locator.
The FDA also provides information on how to properly dispose of prescription drugs. More information is available here: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/where-and-how-dispose-unused-medicines.

How to vote: Due to COVID, Gov. Murphy ordered that the Nov. 3 presidential election be vote by mail in New Jersey.
You cannot machine vote at the polls on Nov. 3 unless you have a documented disability. Monmouth County Clerk Christine Hanlon has said that the best way to vote is dropping your sealed ballot in a ballot drop box — Don't forget to sign it. Monmouth County installed this box in Aberdeen:
Ballot drop boxes are collected and returned directly to the Monmouth County Board of Elections office. These ballots are only handled by designated Board of Elections representatives.
Since the change to this year's election was announced by Murphy, there have been many questions about how the process will work. Below is some further reading on the Nov. 3 election process:"
