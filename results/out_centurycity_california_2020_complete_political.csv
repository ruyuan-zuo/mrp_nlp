Ted Lieu, the Democrat who represents the 33rd Congressional District in West Los Angeles County, cast his vote in Wednesday's House of Representatives vote to approve two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and charge him with abusing his office and obstructing Congress.
The nation's 45th president became just the third person in the office to be impeached. He now faces trial in the Senate and the unlikely possibility of being removed from office for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""
Last week, a bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress. However, given the Senate is controlled by Republicans, it's considered highly unlikely.
Impeachment is not a conviction, rather the rough equivalent of a grand jury issuing indictments. Senators act as judge and jury.
Rep. Ted Lieu voted in favor of impeachment, saying ""no one in America could do what Donald Trump did and get away with it.""
""No American elected official could call up a foreign government and ask for an investigation into a political opponent, no member of congress can call up a foreign official and ask for help in our reelection campaign. If we did that, we'd likely get indicted. No one is above the law, and the Constitution is the law of the land,"" Lieu said. ""Whether Donald Trump leaves in one month, one year or five years, this impeachment is permanent, it will follow him around for the rest of his life and history books will record it. … It's all very simple: No one is above the law.""

Ted Lieu, a Democrat from the Los Angeles area, was recovering Wednesday from surgery to have a stent inserted in one of his arteries.
According to Lieu's Chief of Staff Marc Cevasco, the congressman will be away from work the rest of the week, but the 50-year-old Representative is ""in good spirits and plans to be back at work next week.""
""On Monday evening, at the recommendation of the Office Attending Physician, Congressman Lieu was admitted to George Washington University Hospital for chest pain,"" Cevasco said. ""An electrocardiogram, ultrasound and two blood tests confirmed there was no heart attack and no heart damage. A CT scan showed partial blockage of an artery that was the likely cause of the symptoms.
Lieu underwent stent surgery Tuesday and the surgery was successful, Cevasco said. He is now recovering and will likely be discharged from the hospital later today.
""Congressman Lieu is deeply grateful to all the dedicated professionals at the OAP and GW University Hospital,"" Cevasco said.
Cevasco noted that Lieu ""does plan to watch a lot of TV as he recovers.""
Lieu, who is a staunch critic of President Trump, represents California's 33rd District. The district covers the cities of Santa Monica, Venice, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Calabasas, Agoura Hills, Rancho Palos Verdes, Palos Verdes Estates, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo, part of the city of Torrance, the unincorporated community of Topanga and the neighborhoods of Brentwood, Pacific Palisades, Bel Air, Harbor City, Westwood, Fairfax, Mid-Wilshire, Hancock Park, and parts of San Pedro, Playa del Rey and Playa Vista in the City of Los Angeles, according to Lieu's website.

Protesters began demonstrating hours before Trump's appearance Sunday at UCLA's Moore Hall, multiple media reports said.
""Ourselves and students and people across the country must demand that the Trump-Pence regime must step down now,"" protester Atlas Winfrey, an organizer with the activist group Refuse Fascism told CBS2. ""We can't wait for 2020. We can't sit around and wait for how many more immigrant children to die.""
Refuse Fascism called President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" platform a ""21st century fascist program of Manifest Destiny,"" and a ""specifically American culmination of white supremacy, misogyny and xenophobia.""
Representatives from an organization called Turning Point USA hosted the event on the Westwood campus where Trump talked about his new book, ""Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us.""
Supporter Randy Simer told CBS2 ""He's brave. He takes on the bullies and he's unleashed by it and I love that.""
Another supporter, Andy Stein of Carlsbad, told the Los Angeles Times Trump Jr. is a ""chip off the old block"" and applauded his book concept. ""I understand the concept — the left seems to be triggered by every little thing.""
UCLA officials made it clear the event was not an official university activity, but was instead sponsored by an independent student organization.
""The speakers were invited to campus by one of UCLA's more than 1,200 student organizations, all of whom have access to university resources,"" UCLA spokesman Ricardo Vazquez said. ""Freedom of speech and expression are core values at UCLA, but allowing someone to speak on campus is not an endorsement of their views.
""UCLA is committed to equity, inclusion and mutual respect as well as protecting the physical safety of everyone on campus. This includes their right to speak, be heard, hear others and peacefully dissent.""
During Trump's talk he was often interrupted, jeered and booed by protesters, multiple sources said.
Video from the event appears to show Trump supporters protesting and chanting ""Q&A"" after it was announced a planned questions and answer session was being canceled, actions that were confirmed by various media reports.
""The reason, oftentimes, it doesn't make sense to do the Q&A is not because we're not willing to talk about the questions, cause we do,"" Trump Jr. explained. ""No, it's because people hijack it with nonsense looking to go for some sort of sound bite. You have people spreading nonsense, spreading hate, trying to take over the room.""
Guilfoyle also chastised the crowd and the two prepared to walk off stage without answering questions.
""No, it's because you're not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive and discourteous,"" Guilfoyle said.
Outside the two sides were kept apart by barricades and police in riot gear. No arrests were reported by Los Angeles police.
Trump's son has been making promotional appearances for his newly released book, including a contentious appearance Thursday on the television show, ""The View,"" in which he accused one of the show's hosts of having worn blackface and another for being soft on pedophilia. The book charges ""the left"" with trying to smear conservatives and push them out of the public square.
Later Sunday, Trump Jr. delivered a lecture and signed copies of the book at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley during a sold-out event that reportedly went off without protests or problems.

It's the latest twist in the saga of the controversial mansion built by real estate developer Mohamed Hadid.
Until recently, city officials had been working with Hadid to try to get the building in line with city codes but a structural engineer torpedoed that plan, finding that key structures supporting the building were deficient, according to The Los Angeles Times. But last week, City Attorney Mike Feuer and his prosecutors stepped up their demands, saying that a structural engineer had found that key structures supporting the building were deficient, according to The Times
Los Angeles city prosecutors are calling for the megamansion to be torn down to its foundation, concluding it can't safely be brought in line with city codes.
In a filing, they asked a judge to stiffen the probation conditions for Hadid, requiring him to continue demolishing the building and leave only the parts of the foundation that had been driven into the ground.
The next hearing in the criminal case is scheduled for December. The new push from prosecutors is welcome news to neighbors have been suing to try to get Hadid to tear the building down entirely, arguing that the unfinished mansion puts them at risk downhill.
Hadid pleaded no contest two years ago to criminal charges tied to the mammoth, unfinished building, which prosecutors said was much bigger than city rules allowed and included bedrooms, decks and even an IMAX theater that the city said were never approved. He was ordered to pay fines, do community service and come up with a plan to stabilize the hillside.
City officials have repeatedly said that their goal was to bring the building in line with city rules. Hadid was given a chance to make the mansion meet city codes and has torn down parts of the massive house over time.
In their latest court filing, however, city prosecutors cited concerns about the piles -- a type of column that extends into bedrock to support a structure -- under the mansion at 901 Strada Vecchia Road.
Those vertical structures were ""not drilled to the full depths specified"" in construction drawings and ""do not comply with the minimum reinforcing requirements of the building code,"" structural engineer Carl H. Josephson wrote in a letter to an attorney representing Hadid, who had hired him to examine the building foundation.
The findings echo concerns raised by a former construction manager at the Bel-Air project, Russell Linch, who said in a declaration that the piles should have been driven deeper and have ""less rebar than the minimum required"" under L.A. codes. Linch said he believed the house is unsafe and should be demolished.
Attorneys representing the Bel-Air neighbors argued this week that the latest findings by Josephson confirm that there is a ""life safety issue"" because the piles do not comply with code requirements for ""earthquake resistance."" They complained that Hadid had stonewalled them on producing those findings and tried to hide their severity, The Times reported.

A new location for the Dec. 19 Democratic National Committee event has not yet been determined.
""This morning (Wednesday), the Democratic National Committee asked our media partners to move the Dec. 19, 2019, debate to another venue following renewed and unanticipated objections from organized labor,"" according to a statement from UCLA. ""With regret, we have agreed to step aside as the site of the debate rather than become a potential distraction during this vitally important time in our country's history.""
DNC officials could not be reached for immediate comment. In a statement to HuffPost, DNC senior adviser Mary Beth Cahill said, ""In response to concerns raised by the local organized labor community in Los Angeles, we have asked our media partners to seek an alternative site for the December debate.""
The debate had been scheduled at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico. The debate was expected to air live on PBS and be live-streamed across PBS NewsHour digital platforms on the web, mobile and connected TVs and on Politico's digital and social platforms.
The move comes in response to a continuing dispute between the University of California and AFSCME Local 3299, which represents more than 25,000 UC service and patient technical care workers. The union has been locked in a labor dispute with the university, most recently accusing the UC of outsourcing jobs to ""lower-wage private contractors.""
Liz Perlman, the union's executive director, said previously that the union has been reaching out to Democratic candidates asking them to ""honor the three-year boycott that we've had in place for any speaker attending any event on any of the University of California campuses.""
The union issued a statement Wednesday applauding the DNC's decision to relocate the debate.
""And we are grateful to the candidates and other leaders who have stood with us in solidarity on our picket lines,"" according to the union. ""Just as our next president must work to heal the divisions in our country, they must also work to confront the staggering inequality and mistreatment of low-wage workers that have become all too common in today's economy.""

5,/california/centurycity/how-your-westwood-representative-voted-impeachment-inquiry,2019-11-02T01:37:46Z,How Your LA Legislators Voted On Impeachment,0,0,Paige Austin,Patch Staff,"LOS ANGELES, CA — The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved eight pages of procedures to take the impeachment inquiry against President Trump to nationally broadcast public hearings. Just about all of LA County's legislators, which includes many of the president's chief antagonists such as Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff, are Democrats who voted in favor of the move. Technically, there is a tiny slice of the county — a nugget of Lancaster that falls into the Republican District represented by Trump ally and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He's the only legislator from the region who voted no.
These LA County legislators all voted yes:
The resolution defining the scope of the next phase of the inquiry was approved mainly along party lines, 232-196.
The House will move ahead with impeachment proceedings against Trump after a government whistleblower's claims the president used the power of his office to solicit a foreign government to influence the 2020 U.S. election. Much of the testimony and documents released after the claim have supported the whistleblower's account.
The impeachment effort has focused on three panels — Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform. In closed-door hearings that included Republicans on the committees, investigations have centered on how Trump urged Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, now running for president, while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid.
An investigation by the Judiciary Committee has focused on possible obstruction of justice by the president, based on episodes described in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Provisions in the resolution allow Democratic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the Intelligence committee's chairman, and Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the panel's top Republican, to each question witnesses for up to 90 minutes or delegate their time to staffers before rank-and-file lawmakers each ask questions for five minutes.
Republicans on the Intelligence and Judiciary committees could subpoena witnesses and documents, subject to the chairman's approval, and Republicans could ask for a committee vote.
The vote came as Tim Morrison, Trump's former top adviser for Russian and European affairs, arrived on Capitol Hill to testify before the House. Morrison, who left his job Wednesday, served on the National Security Council and is the first White House political appointee to testify.
His testimony was scheduled behind closed doors, but he could provide information that is central to the push to remove Trump from office. Specifically, he will be asked to explain the ""sinking feeling"" he said he got when Trump demanded Ukraine's president investigate former Biden and his son over business dealings in Ukraine.
The resolution approved Thursday directs the House Intelligence Committee to hold the public hearings and write a report that will be handed off to the House Judiciary Committee, which would then draft articles of impeachment.
If the House moves forward, the Republican-controlled Senate would decide whether to remove Trump from office."

It will be streamed -- without requiring log-in to a cable provider -- on CNN.com, across mobile devices via CNN's apps for iOS and Android, and via CNNgo apps for Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast and Android TV.
Under rules set by the DNC, candidates needed to either register 1% support in three qualified polls or have 65,000 unique donors to their campaign, including a minimum of 200 donors in at least 20 states, to qualify for the debate.
A draw determined whether candidates would debate Tuesday or Wednesday. The draw formula used by CNN guaranteed that two of the top four candidates and five of the top 10 would be on the same stage.
The candidates' positions on the stage at the Fox Theatre in Detroit was determined by public polling numbers, with the top candidates at the center. Former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris will be in the middle Wednesday.

The public utility company will deliver millions of free LED light bulbs to homes across the county, a move designed to dramatically reduce electricity usage over time.
""Not only will this simple change help save the environment, it will also put money back in our customers' pocketbooks,"" DWP General Manager David H. Wright said in a statement. ""The LED household distribution program is a cost-effective way to deliver energy efficiency directly to all of LADWP's residential customers, both in single-family as well as multi-family homes.""
In all, the public utility plans to deliver 2.8 million free LED light bulbs to residential customers by the end of July. Each week, several crews will be deployed to distribute reusable bags containing two 12-watt LED bulbs to nearly 125,000 homes, according to the agency.
The cost to deliver the LED bulbs to customers is about $7.9 million, and if all residential customers switch to the product, DWP estimates 4,410 gigawatt hours of energy could be saved, equivalent to taking 330,000 vehicles off the road annually.
The bulbs will be distributed by DWP contractor PowerDirect, and employees will wear identification and yellow vests when dropping off light bulbs.
""If LADWP customers replace two 75-watt incandescent bulbs with the two 12-watt LED bulbs, they can expect to save a combined 138 kilowatt-hours annually for the life of the bulbs, estimated to last nearly 23 years,"" according to DWP.

It will be Biden's first fundraising swing through LA since he announced his candidacy, and he'll be following in the footsteps of about every major Democratic presidential hopeful, all of whom have already come with hat-in-hand. Since announcing his candidacy, Biden has emerged as the candidate to beat largely because he polls well against President Donald Trump. South Bend, Indiana Mayor and presidential contender Pete Buttigieg will be on his heels, hitting the region to fundraise the next day.
According to various reports, Biden will attend a midday fundraising event at the Los Angeles home of UCLA School of Medicine faculty member Dr. Cynthia Telles and her husband, media executive Joe Waz. Then he is slated to head over to the the Beverly Hills home of James Costos, the U.S. ambassador to Spain during President Barack Obama's administration, and his husband, designer Michael Smith. The event is expected to draw Hollywood power brokers including film mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, producer Peter Chernin and director Rob Reiner. Katzenberg also hosted an October fundraiser in Beverly Hills on behalf of Biden's political action committee, American Possibilities. Biden spoke at that event.
Biden, the famously pro-union politician, will be greeted by National Union of Healthcare Worker protestors angered by his association with Telles, a board member with the Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. The union is looking to gain Biden's backing in a continuing labor dispute with Kaiser Permanente.
NUHW staged a five-day strike at Kaiser facilities in December, contending the dispute is focused on under-staffing that forces mental-health care patients ""to wait months to see their therapists."" Kaiser has rebuffed that claim, insisting the union is not concerned about access to care, but about higher wages and increased benefits. Hospital officials said in December the union's demands ""would reduce, not increase, the availability of mental health care for our members.""
In a statement Tuesday, NUHW President Sal Rosselli said Biden ""has the chance to do the right thing by standing with Kaiser clinicians and patients committed to making Kaiser provide timely and adequate care.""
Tickets to the Wednesday evening fundraiser cost $2,800, which includes a photo reception with Biden. Becoming a co-host of the event costs $10,000, according to an invitation obtained by The Washington Post.
On Thursday, Buttigieg is expected to attend a rally with various union members in support of a proposed parcel tax on the June 4 ballot to raise funds for the Los Angeles Unified School District.

About 435,000 homeowners countywide qualify for a $70 savings on their annual tax bill, but fail to apply for an $7,000 exemption available for a taxpayer's principal residence, according to Prang, who declared January as Homeowners' Exemption Awareness Month.
""It is not surprising that the savings program goes unnoticed, as homeowners usually only contact the office when they are buying or selling their property. Being that they are already inundated with paperwork, our application can easily get lost in the shuffle,"" Prang said.
Taxpayers only need to apply once to get the savings every year until they sell their home. The only eligibility requirement is that the property is the owners' principal residence on January 1.
""We estimate that one in three families do not take advantage of saving $70 each year, totaling almost $1,000 over the average length of homeownership. This savings can potentially go towards investing in easy home improvements such as purchasing a new water heater or installing new sprinklers. I encourage every homeowner to apply,"" Prang said.
The county's awareness campaign will focus on communities with the highest percentage of unclaimed exemptions. Palmdale homeowners, for example, leave almost $1 million on the table by failing to request an exemption. More than 40 percent of eligible homeowners in Lancaster, Lynwood and Pomona also fail to apply.
The deadline for applying and receiving the full exemption is February 15.

A new app to be unveiled Thursday will provide Angelenos with early warning for quakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater in Los Angeles County.
It is the nation's first public early warning system, and it could be a major lifesaver. The app is part of a pilot program with the U.S. Geological Survey, AT&T and The Annenberg Foundation.
""Earthquakes are a matter of when -- not if. We're officially launching #ShakeAlertLA tomorrow, and today you can become one of the first to use our early warning technology,"" according to a statement on Mayor Eric Garcetti's Twitter account.
The ShakeAlertLA app will be officially unveiled at City Hall Thursday, but you can already download the app on many mobile phones at Mayor.LA/3pwx30nakMm.
Designed to save lives by giving people time to head to safety before major building damage, it remains to be seen just how much, if any, warning residents will get.
""ShakeAlert is NOT a prediction that an earthquake will occur. It signals that an earthquake has started and you may feel shaking. This app is meant to help provide alerts for your safety,"" according to the app.
The mobile app is designed to provide advance notice that an earthquake is about to strike through a text or other electronic means. It works with the system known as ShakeAlert, which is based on a network of in- ground sensors developed by USGS to detect seismic activity.
""You may receive the alert before, during or after shaking,"" the app tells users. ""Take protective action as soon as you receive an alert or feel or hear an earthquake. Drop, cover and hold on.""
The City Council in June approved the negotiation of a $300,000 contract with AT&T and the GRYD Foundation for the design, creation and deployment of the Early Earthquake Warning System Mobile Application.
In addition to providing quake alerts, the app also includes tips on preparing for and recovering from a quake. It also includes a listing and map of recent quakes.

Pending approval by Mayor Eric Garcetti, speed limits would rise on some of the Southland's most familiar thoroughfares, including San Vicente Boulevard through Mid-Wilshire and stretches of Reseda, Victory and Chandler boulevards in the San Fernando Valley.
The increases reflect a Catch-22 that city officials have faced for decades on dozens of miles of major streets: Raise the speed limit, or lose the ability to write most speeding tickets.
The dilemma stems from a decades-old California law designed to protect drivers from speed traps, which requires cities to post speed limits that reflect the natural speed of traffic. If a speed limit is too low, or if it is more than seven years old, police cannot use radar guns or other electronic devices to write speeding tickets there.
As recently as this summer, more than 200 miles of Los Angeles streets, including corridors that are among the deadliest for pedestrians and bicyclists, had expired limits and very little speed enforcement, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The Transportation Department's proposal would raise the speed limit on 101.6 miles of streets and boost the share of streets where officers can write speeding tickets to 97.5 percent, officials told the newspaper.
Nearly two-thirds of the street miles that would see higher speed limits are in the Valley, which has seen several waves of increases over the last decade on its broad, flat boulevards. Most Valley streets would see speeds rise to 40 mph and 45 mph.
The proposed increases follow the City Council's decision last December to raise speed limits on 94 miles of streets, mainly in the Valley.

I have been an advocate for women's rights my entire career, and I'm going to continue to be an advocate. I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing. I am a father to two beautiful, smart daughters. I would never disrespect them by touching a woman inappropriately or striking a woman. I am looking forward to a full investigation at which point I am confident that I will be fully exonerated.""

15,/california/centurycity/city-ponies-westside-homeless-shelter,2018-10-05T20:13:18Z,City Ponies Up For Westside Homeless Shelter,0,0,California News Wire Services,News Partner,"LOS ANGELES, CA — A proposal to fund the city's portion of a temporary homeless shelter to be located on the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration campus was approved by the Los Angeles City Council Friday.
Under a partnership, the city and county of Los Angeles will split the cost of the construction of the $5 million facility, and the Department of Veterans Affairs will provide on-site services.
The City Council unanimously approved a motion seeking funding for the facility, which is to be located on the grounds of the VA campus.
It will provide transitional housing beds for up to 100 homeless veterans, along with laundry facilities, personal hygiene centers, 24-hour security and supportive services.
""This is a really big deal for veterans that the VA is finally starting to deliver, and I'm really glad that the city of Los Angeles and the county are helping them deliver,"" Councilman Mike Bonin said earlier this week at a Homelessness and Poverty Committee meeting before it moved the motion forward.
The facility is scheduled to open in early 2019, and will be one of several new programs and facilities at the site aimed at helping homeless vets.
The VA also is working on its Draft Master Plan, which calls for 1,200 units of permanent supportive housing on the Westside campus.
The VA additionally has opened a ""safe parking"" program for veterans living in their vehicles, and started providing permanent supportive housing for homeless veterans in existing buildings, with 54 veterans currently housed in Building 209.
With financial support from the city through HHH bond funds, two other buildings are being converted into permanent supportive housing for veterans.
The facility will be part of Mayor Eric Garcetti's ""A Bridge Home"" program, which calls for temporary homeless facilities in each of the city's 15 council districts. One temporary facility in Councilman Jose Huizar's district near the El Pueblo Historic Monument has already opened, with other sites at various stages of development.
The VA bridge housing site will include two tension membrane structures along with modular trailers that will not be visible from the exterior of the VA campus, according to Bonin's motion.

16,/california/centurycity/city-controller-blasts-la-zoos-management,2018-04-26T02:58:49Z,City Controller Blasts LA Zoo's Management,0,0,California News Wire Services,News Partner,"LOS ANGELES, CA — The Los Angeles Zoo is in need of a new governing model and other reforms, as the current leadership structure has resulted in an institution that does not live up to its full potential, according to a report issued Wednesday by City Controller Ron Galperin.
""Amid staffing shortages, infrastructure challenges and budget limitations, the Los Angeles Zoo has fostered an appreciation for wildlife and educated generations of young people and adults,"" Galperin said. ""But more can done to go beyond the status quo. The question is not whether change is needed at the zoo, but what form it will take. By implementing my recommendations, the zoo will best be able to ensure the welfare of the zoo's diverse and unique plants and animals so future generations of animal lovers can continue enjoying one of L.A.'s most beloved places.""
The zoo is a City Council-controlled department that was created by an ordinance. A citizen Board of Zoo Commissioners advises the zoo's general manager, who is responsible for control and management of the Zoo Department, while the nonprofit Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association manages some programs related to zoo memberships, fundraising, marketing and other areas.
Galperin's report said GLAZA does not publicly post its detailed financial transactions, only more general financial reports, but should begin to provide the details of its operational revenue and expense transactions online, which would be more in line with how the city operates.
The report also said that both the zoo and GLAZA need to develop better performance metrics, and to clarify and consolidate a number of memorandums that outline their operating agreements. Galperin said the agreements have ""created ambiguity and inconsistencies.""
Galperin's report also says the city and zoo would be better served by a different governing model, and pointed to both the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Natural History Museum as examples to consider.
LACMA is run by a nonprofit under a 99-year contract with the county, while the LACMA director remains a county employee and is also the CEO of the nonprofit. The Natural History Museum is also run by a nonprofit with some of its leadership appointed directly by the county Board of Supervisors, according to Galperin's report.
Zoo Director John Lewis told City News Service he welcomed the report and agreed with many of its recommendations.
""We are actually pretty comfortable with the report. It covers a number of issues we've been dealing with for a number of years and have brought up before in regard to the multitude of agreements between the city and GLAZA, and the ordinance that forms the zoo. There's so many of them and they overlap,"" Lewis said.
Lewis also said he was agreeable to the idea of changing the governance structure and some other ideas outlined in the report, which can be found at www.lacontroller.org/LAZooReport.
GLAZA issued a statement saying it also welcomed some of the proposals and was open to having a discussion on them.
""Our unique model has been successful, but we concur with the city controller that there are areas for improvement. GLAZA is committed to creating a more streamlined, more effective and transparent contractual structure for the zoo and GLAZA to ensure both organizations are adequately funded and professionally and financially sustainable,"" the statement said. ""GLAZA already has moved proactively on implementing several of the recommended measures (posting financial information) and looks forward to working with our zoo partners and the city to address other recommendations.""

""Today's groundbreaking is a clear indication that this project to link downtown L.A. to our region's second-largest job center is on time and on budget,"" said Garcetti, who also serves as the Metro Board chair.

Garcetti's office said the second section is scheduled for completion in 2025, and is part of a larger three-phase, 8.9-mile, seven-station construction project that will extend the Purple Line from the current terminus at Wilshire/Western to the Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles Medical Center just west of the 405 Freeway.
""Los Angeles laid out a bold vision for its future, and today's groundbreaking marks a significant step in making that a reality,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein said. ""As we begin construction on the second phase, I remain committed to working with our local leaders and the federal government to complete the Purple Line Extension on time. I'm confident that by 2028, Los Angeles will have a world-class subway system when we welcome the world for the Summer Olympics.""
Section 1 of the project, between Wilshire/Western and Wilshire/La Cienega, is now 30 percent complete and scheduled to open in 2023. The third and final section of the project from Century City to the VA Medical Center is planned to break ground by spring 2019 and open in 2026.
Metro said it has already secured a construction contractor and will apply $1.5 billion in federal grants and loans to build the second section of the extension at a total cost of around $2.5 billion.
