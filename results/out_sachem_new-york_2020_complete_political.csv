0,/new-york/sachem/five-corners-intersection-be-improved,2020-02-07T17:55:06Z,Dangerous intersection to receive overhaul.,0,2,Jacqueline Sweet,Patch Staff,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY— The intersection of Hawkins Avenue, Smith Street and Gatelot Avenue has been known as The Five Corners to Ronkonkoma area residents for years. On January 30th, however, Brookhaven Town officials announced a plan to acquire private property in advance of the improvement plan, designed to reduce congestion and accidents. The new plan will make Gatelot Avenue a cul-de-sac, eliminating one of the corners, and add a traffic light, according to interviews done by Newsday. This new initiative replaces a previous 2011 resolution to construct a traffic roundabout at the intersection.
A representative for Councilman Kevin LaValle told Patch that a public forum will be held the last week of February to discuss the project. A notice to immediate neighbors will be mailed to announce the details of the public meeting.
Patch talked to local residents about their thoughts on the proposed project, some of whom questioned the reported danger of the intersection. Dan Howell, of Ronkonkoma, said ""I used to traverse this intersection twice daily as part of my commute. I've never considered it to be an unsafe intersection and I do not recall ever seeing an accident there.""
Timothy Murphy, another Ronkonkoma resident, said he felt sentimental about the location, which he says is a landmark of sorts for locals who remember the now-closed Five Corners Deli, even as it proved an obstacle on his local running route.
""Can't count how many times during a run I had to 'frogger' my way through that intersection. I'll definitely miss it."""

The Citizens Campaign for the Environment unveiled its comprehensive study on Tuesday.
Local residents, like 80 percent of the county, get their water from the Suffolk County Water Authority, which services about 1.2 million people. Here's the breakdown for the Suffolk County Water Authority:
Estimated cost for first 1,000 gallons of water: $2.028
Billing cycle: Quarterly
Estimated cost per billing cycle: $88.75 (includes rates, taxes and service fees)
Estimated cost per year: $355 (includes rates, taxes and service fees)
Fee structure:
Your turn: Tell us on Facebook or in the comments how much you pay for water.
While that may seem high, get this — New York American Water Service Area customers in the NorthShore-Sea Cliff area pay an estimated $1,124.52. That's more than anywhere else on the island. Shelter Island Heights and service area 1 of the New York American Water Service Area rounded out the three most expensive districts.

Feds To investigate New York American Water Rates: Schumer
Adrienne Esposito, executive director at the organization, told Patch on Wednesday they initially thought that determining the cost of water on Long Island would be easy — they would grab the water rates from the various districts and compare them.
""We found it easier to find the lost continent of Atlantis,"" she said.
Finding out what water districts charge is actually ""obscure,"" ""convoluted"" and ""cryptic,"" she told reporters on Tuesday. Some districts tack on fees separate from the actual water rates included in the bill, some have a yearly access fee, and still other have hidden fees that are separate from the water rates and are not included in the consumer bill, such as for infrastructure and water treatment.
New York American Water has a residential water service charge applied to every bill based on size of water meter. Those with a 5/8-inch water meter pay $12.50, while those with a 1-inch meter pay $17.74. Furthermore, rates for the district are based on various factors that ""substantially fluctuate"" depending on the community.
Esposito said it's a public right to know the price of water, and the major takeaway is that people don't know how much they pay.
""The bottom line is there's no uniform cost for water,"" she said. ""The existing pricing scheme is confusing and obscure for the public and it needs to be more transparent.""
The report looks at how much water costs, where the different water costs are hidden in water and tax bills, and what that means for residents.
There are 48 water districts on the island, 11 in Suffolk County and 37 in Nassau County. The researchers said they used the most recent data available on water districts' websites and annual drinking water reports for the study. The vast majority of districts were also called multiple times for further data and verification of costs, the group said.
Researchers assumed a typical family had four members, which the typical uses about 10,000 gallons of water per month, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
The organization also issued several recommendations:"
3,/new-york/sachem/suffolk-tackle-plastic-crisis,2019-02-13T21:11:11Z,Suffolk to Tackle Plastic Crisis,0,0,Seth Squicciarino,Community Contributor,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
When it comes to the waste generated by single-use plastics and polystyrene, the plastics crisis is more urgent than people realize, and Suffolk must clean-up its act according to members of the county's Single-Use Plastic Reduction Task Force who unveiled four proposals intended to achieve that goal. Led by Suffolk County Legislator Kara Hahn who serves as chairperson of the task force, the group outlined regulations directed at both businesses and the County itself that ban the use of polystyrene food service products and sale of polystyrene packaging; require restaurants to provide biodegradable straws and stirrers by request only while disallowing plastic ones; prohibit County concessionaires from distributing single-use cups, utensils or beverage straws made from non-biodegradable substances and require the County to install water fountains designed to allow bottle filling at most of its facilities.
If fully adopted by the Legislature, implementation of these policy changes would be staggered with the polystyrene ban taking effect approximately three months after its approval; the straws and stirrers policy beginning on January 1, 2020; the County concessionaire prohibition on single use plastic being included in all future license agreements; and existing water fountains being replaced as they age.
""Today we announce policies that will come to define our County's environmental legacy for generations to come,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""The vast and growing scale of the worldwide plastics problem has become a growing threat to human health. We as a County have worked, in some cases decades, to address the challenges posed by these dangerous pollutants. Now, with the backing of science and evolving public awareness, support for policies limiting and banning substances that threaten human health and our environment has reached a turning point. It's time to take a stand against this growing threat.""
Specifically being proposed is a ban of polystyrene food service products including plates, cups, containers and trays and loose fill packaging; a disallowance of providing single use, non-biodegradable plastic straws and stirrers with environmental friendly alternatives only allowed upon customer request; replacing existing water fountains with ones designed to allow bottle filling at County facilities that have ten or more employees and parks that include water dispensers; and including a requirement that concessionaire license agreements awarded by the County after the bill's passage include a restriction on the use of plastic and non-biodegradable cups, utensils and beverage straws.
The bills make accommodations for people with disabilities whose medical conditions necessitate use of plastic straws. Additionally, the polystyrene ban exempts items used to store uncooked eggs, raw meat, pork, fish, seafood and poultry.
The impacts of plastic and polystyrene waste on our environment are well documented. According to the not-for-profit Ocean Conservancy, ""Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments."" As a result, ingested plastic has been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and in 100% of sea turtles species. While this has been devastating to marine life and ocean ecosystems, the impacts of plastic and, in particular, polystyrene are also a tangible threat to human health. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has classified styrene as a potential human carcinogen and the Environmental Protection Agency says the polystyrene manufacturing process is the fifth largest creator of hazardous waste in the United States. Furthermore, said Hahn, ""in recent years, minute micro-plastics and fibers, measuring the width of a human hair or far less, have been found in an extraordinary range of products, such as honey and sugar, shellfish, bottled and tap water, beer, processed foods, table salt and soft drinks, which means that just like the sea turtles and birds, we humans are ingesting plastic virtually every day.""
This won't be the County's first attempt to improve our environment by banning these plastics. In 1988 Suffolk, which had already long been respected for its environmental stewardship, hoped to ban Styrofoam use by supermarkets and fast-food restaurants to protect air quality and groundwater from the ""hazards and toxicity"" associated with their disposal. Unfortunately, that policy was reversed a year later due to a procedural issue. In 2013, Legislator Hahn had introduced a polystyrene ban that did not pass the legislature.
""It's been 30 years since Suffolk first sounded the alarm on the dangers of single use plastic,"" said Hahn. ""During those three decades, not a single piece of plastic has biodegraded. We must reduce use now or suffer the consequences for generations to come.""
Dr. Rebecca Grella, a research scientist and educator in the Brentwood Union Free School District agreed, ""My students and I have found a significant amount of plastic in the salt marshes we study. We have plastic from the 1990's as evidence from the bottle caps we are finding. There is a tremendous amount of plastic in these marshes and we need a solution.""
Later this afternoon, each of the initiatives will be assigned to a committee with the polystyrene ban and the by-request-only requirement, which are local laws, expected to be taken up by the Health Committee; the concessionaire bill to be considered by the Parks and Recreation Committee and finally, the water dispenser proposal to be put before the Public Works Committee. The earliest the proposals can be approved by the Legislature will be March 5th for the non-local laws and March 26th for others that require a public hearing.
According to Beth Fiteni, Director of Green Inside and Out, a Long Island based nonprofit organization that promotes living environmentally consciously, ""Each one of us makes a difference with our daily actions. While no one step is the whole solution to preventing plastic pollution, these proactive steps being considered by the Suffolk County legislature on polystyrene, plastic straws, and refilling water bottles show strong leadership towards reducing waste and protecting our oceans, rivers and lakes.""
A sentiment shared by Colleen Henn, Clean Water Coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation, ""Suffolk County Legislators are stepping up to protect the environment and human health by introducing bills that reduce plastics pollution. The three laws proposed by Legislator Hahn and the Single Use Plastics Reduction Task Force smartly focus on preventing plastics from being introduced to the environment in the first place. By providing plastic straws by request only, prohibiting polystyrene foam, and providing water bottle re-fill stations at county buildings, parks, and establishments, the County is using an upstream approach to get ourselves out of this plastic mess we have created. If these laws pass, it will be a hat-trick for the health of our oceans and Surfrider Foundation's members will definitely be celebrating!""
""How do you conquer a world-wide crisis?"" asked Legislator Hahn. ""One local County at a time if necessary. An island, like Long Island, surrounded by the ocean and the Sound with water so intricately tided to our life and our identity, should be at the forefront of this issue, not wait to be last in line."""
4,/new-york/sachem/best-practices-er-treatment-overdose-victims,2018-10-03T18:21:09Z,Best Practices for ER Treatment of Overdose...,0,0,Seth Squicciarino,Community Contributor,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
Citing a lack of standardized protocols throughout the County's hospital emergency rooms for patients who've overdosed on opioids, the Suffolk Legislature last night approved the creation of a 13 member panel to draft recommendations for treating the addiction component of an overdose in patients. The bill sponsored by the Legislature's Majority Leader Kara Hahn and Legislator William Spencer will create a working group comprised of health department officials, hospital representatives and addiction experts charged with developing a model of best practices that emergency departments can voluntarily implement. The group will have seven months to put together its guidelines that the Suffolk County Department of Health Services will then provide to hospitals. Following the initial protocol's distribution, members will continue to convene annually to consider revisions or additions to the guidance.
While emergency rooms are primarily designed to treat the immediate toxicological aspects of an overdose, hospitals often follow post-opioid overdose protocols that may include offering overdose prevention education, naloxone and related training for patients, family members, and friends; linking patients to treatment and services in the community and starting Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) of Opioid Addiction including use of Methadone and Suboxone. Currently, New York State doesn't prescribe uniform recommendations on post-overdose treatment of patients, leaving decisions on the type of services to provide, or not provide, to individual hospitals across the state.
""Being brought back to life from an overdose is about as rock bottom as it can get for an addict, but the realization that you have been granted another chance at life is perhaps the ideal point to begin rebuilding,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""Ensuring every hospital in Suffolk has a set of effective protocols dealing with overdose and addiction that focuses on best practices for success will provide all in this County a better shot at overcoming addition.""
""I applaud Legislator Hahn for her leadership on this critical issue. By bringing together experts in the health care and addiction fields to develop the best practices and model protocols for our emergency departments, we can help save lives and put addicts on the path toward long term recovery,"" stated Legislator William R. Spencer, MD.
Research has consistently linked the types of post-overdose care provided in emergency departments with the continuation of addiction treatment following release. A 2015 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association of three different interventions methods used for opioid-dependent patients who visited one emergency department found that 78 percent of patients who received highly integrated services inclusive of MAT were still in treatment 30 days following discharge compared to just 37 percent who received just a pamphlet listing contact information for available addiction counseling services.
According to Executive Director Steve Chassman ,""The Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (LICADD) commends Legislator Kara Hahn and her colleagues in the Suffolk County Legislature, for addressing the disparities in protocols surrounding overdose victims in our communities and local medical facilities. Thank you Legislator Hahn for inquiring with a cross section of professionals to assess where the gaps in services exist and allowing the medical and human service professionals to develop concrete protocols focusing on how to best assist individuals and families who experience near fatal overdoses in Suffolk County. This important piece of legislation will positively impact a multitude of individuals and families in Suffolk County suffering from the ravages of a substance use disorder.""
Dr. Jeffrey L. Reynolds of Family and Children's Association added, ""As we begin to turn the corner in Suffolk's heroin and opioid crisis, we must make sure that those who land in emergency rooms following an overdose get timely and comprehensive care that reflects the latest clinical protocols. An overdose and subsequent trip to the emergency room is traumatic, but if managed correctly with proper intervention, care and support can provide a life-changing shot at recovery. Legislator Hahn was among the first to advocate for increased naloxone availability several years ago and we are pleased that her quest to save lives continues with this excellent piece of legislation."""

A statement on Suffolk County's website reminds New Yorkers that personal use of fireworks is not permitted under the law (with the exception of some sparklers for people aged 18 and over in certain areas), because they can easily inflict bodily harm.
""Fireworks may appear fun and harmless, but unfortunately all too often they cause serious injury,"" said State Fire Administrator Bryant D. Stevens in the statement. ""Every year, far too many people suffer life long injuries, and far too many fires are caused by the use of illegal fireworks - these are injuries and fires that can, and must be prevented.""
Instead, the statement suggests citizens enjoy fireworks displays run by professionals, which are available across Long Island.
It also warns of an increase in easy access to illegal fireworks, through direct marketing, mail flyers, websites, and retailers across the state border.
A man in Suffolk County was injured this week while using fireworks that ignited in his hand. Two of his fingers were severed in the explosion.

""This is another step toward spurring economic development in the Ronkonkoma Hub which will create thousands of new jobs in Suffolk County and provide a more convenient public transportation option to our residents,"" said Bellone in a statement.

""They prostitute themselves in front of the NRA,"" a visibly upset Bratton said of pro-gun Republicans, who blocked a bill the day after the San Bernardino massacre last year that would have banned people on the terror watch list from purchasing guns. ""They put the interests of their own political careers and that of the NRA ahead of the American people.""
In the wake of Sunday's shooting in Orlando by a man armed with a Sig Sauer MCX rifle, an A-15 style weapon, many people, including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, are calling for a ban on assault weapons.
The gun used in the Orlando massacre, as well as those used in the Sandy Hook and Colorado theater shootings in 2012, can fire about eight rounds in a second ""in capable hands,"" the owner of a gun-engineering company told the New York Times.
""A Snapchat video taken at the scene in Orlando illustrates its devastating power: the shooter can be heard firing more than 20 shots in a single nine-second stretch,"" Rolling Stone reported.
""Most forms of the gun had been prohibited under the 1994 federal assault weapons ban that was allowed to expire in 2004, following ferocious lobbying by the National Rifle Association,"" the New York Daily News reported.
Today, the gun is very easy to buy. Just ask Helen Ubiñas, a columnist for the Philadelphia Daily News, who says she was about to purchase a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle in seven minutes, from the moment she ""handed the salesperson my driver's license to the moment I passed my background check,"" at a gun shop in Philadelphia Monday.
Often called the most political gun in America, AR-15s range in price between $500 and $3,000.
In central Oregon, Redmond Black Rifle/Colfax Tactical owner Larry Myers told KTVZ that he expects gun sales to increase following the Orlando massacre, which left 49 people and dozens more injured.
""It is a tactical weapon commonly used for home defense but most often utilized (for shooting) varmints,"" Myers said. ""The civilian version of the AR-15 is not a full automatic, it's a semi-automatic — pull the trigger once and get one bullet.
""They do not empty magazines within one minute unless you pull the trigger that many times,"" Myers said.
Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was once in favor of a national assault weapons ban, but he has changed his tune recently.
""I changed positions because we need protection in this country,"" Trump said on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday. ""We need protection. We have to have protection. And the bad guys have them, so if the bad guys have them, we need protection in this country.""

The views expressed here are the author's own.
The Suffolk County Legislature has given the Suffolk County Traffic and Parking Violations Agency (SCTPVA) up to 90 days to develop a payment program for the fines it levies to ticketed motorists. The directive gives the agency three months to develop a proposal that, if approved by the Legislature, would allow non-moving violators to pay their fines in installments rather than as one lump sum due immediately.
The initiative was sponsored by Legislator Kara Hahn (D-Setauket) after receiving an appeal from one of her constituents who was threatened with the suspension of his license after he could not pay his fine in full.
""The revocation of a driver's license should be reserved for violators who endanger public safety, not for someone unable to pay a fine on the day it is imposed,"" said Legislator Hahn.
Unpaid fines, fees and surcharges associated with parking tickets are often not collected or prove costly to collect and can result in lost revenue for Suffolk County's government and taxpayers. Suffolk County currently has $2.3 million in outstanding tickets. The legislator added that a payment plan option is a win-win because it helps struggling Suffolk County citizens meet their obligations to both their families and to the county.
According to Legislator Hahn and Legislator Kate Browning (WFP, Shirley), Chair of the Legislature's Public Safety Committee, punitive measures are intended to be teaching moments, rather than a road to economic ruin.
""I congratulate Legislator Hahn for bringing this issue forward,"" said Browning. ""As a co-sponsor of the bill, I agree that no one should have to make a choice between putting food on the table for their family or paying a fine. Failure to pay causes a person to have a suspended license and potentially lose their employment. A payment plan for middle and low income residents will benefit the resident and the agency.""
""A deterrent should never become a detriment, nor should the sting of a ticket ever become the hunger pains of a child,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""While these fines are supposed to serve as a financial deterrent to behavior that puts the public at risk, when unaffordable penalties are imposed and become due immediately, our residents are forced to make decisions that are counter to our values and to the public interest.""
Violators cited in nearby New York City have the option of paying fines through an installment plan which requires that a portion of the fee be paid at the time of conviction, followed by monthly payments with a 9 percent interest charge until the debt is paid in full. Suffolk eventual plan may take a similar form as the SCTPVA develops its own program.
The directive to the SCTPVA now goes to the County Executive for final approval. Then, once the SCTPVA develops its plan, the Legislature will have an opportunity to evaluate the proposal and decide whether to implement it.
""Punishment without mercy does not serve this county or its residents. I encourage the County Executive to sign this bill as it advances the central tenant of fairness in justice,"" concluded Legislator Hahn."

But LIRR officials are recommending that Manhattan-bound riders transfer to the subway in Brooklyn to avoid a crowded and heavily guarded Penn Station when the Pope is in town from Thursday until Saturday morning.
""We are proud to host Pope Francis here in New York, and we are working to expand mass transit options to ensure that everyone can travel safely and securely during this time,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press release. ""I encourage anyone planning to be in New York City at that time to plan ahead and check the new travel schedules.""
More on the Pope's Visit:
The LIRR will operate its normal AM and PM peak train service to and from Penn Station. In addition, the LIRR will operate eight additional off-peak westbound trains to Penn Station on Friday, including:
Extra eastbound LIRR trains will be on standby at Penn Station ready to pick up Long Islanders after the Papal Mass at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. Those going to papal events are advised by the MTA to buy round-trip train tickets and MetroCards in advance and to expect train crowding.
""Pope Francis' visit to New York is a significant honor for everyone in our service area, and we are prepared to accommodate additional customers traveling to his events along with our 8.6 million average weekday customers,"" MTA Chairman Thomas F. Prendergast said in a press release. ""While some schedules and routes may change, we are ready to get everyone where they need to go during this special time.""
Certain entrances, exits and stairways in Penn Station will be closed for security reasons. Be prepared for it to be extra crowded when leaving Penn Station. MTA Police and additional LIRR staff will be in Penn Station to help any commuters who need assistance.
These entrances will remain open:
Only those who have tickets are permitted to go the Pope's events. Everyone else should avoid the areas the Pope is visiting, as road closures will cause plenty of traffic.
The MTA suggests commuters to consider traveling to/from Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and to then transfer to the 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q and R subway lines.
Travelers should check Pope Francis' New York Itinerary, news and traffic reports. Commuters can find more information about transit conditions by signing up for LIRR alerts.

The findings analyzed data on the ideologies of each governor currently serving. Cuomo came in fifth behind Tom Wolf (D-PA), Jay Inslee (D-WA), Mark Dayton (D-MN), and Peter Schulman (D-VT).
Cuomo's public statements, press releases, and other information were analyzed on popular and important political issues. The study found he was most liberal when it came to individual rights, moderately liberal on domestic and economic issues, and moderately conservative on defense and international issues.
For example, Cuomo was deemed ""very liberal"" when it comes to individual rights, according to his stance on legally requiring the hiring of women and minorities, comfort with same-sex marriage, and support for easing the voter registration process.
On the other hand, Cuomo is ""moderately conservative"" on defense and international issues, considering his strong support for the expansion of free trade, support of ""American exceptionalism,"" and his wish to avoid foreign entanglements.

How dependent is New York on the federal government compared to other states?
It's somewhere in the middle, according to a new study.
WalletHub conducted a study to answer that question across the county. It used four factors to come up with a ranking of all 50 states:
New York came in at No. 20, with No. 1 being the least dependent and No. 50 being the most, right behind Washington and just ahead of Rhode Island.
You can see the full results in the map below:

The five least-dependent states were New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota and Kansas. The most dependent were Montana, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and New Mexico.
There was one area where New York stands out: federal funding. Federal funding accounts for 43.39 percent of state revenue, which is more than any other state except Vermont.
One irony pointed out by WalletHub was the discrepancy in how states voted vs. how reliant they were on the federal government.
States that voted Republican in the 2012 election, whose party preaches less dependance on the government, had an average rank of 33.2. States that tend to vote Democrat had an average rank of 18.3.

The U.S. Transportation Department has opened a price-gouging investigation against five major U.S. airlines to determine whether the companies inflated flight prices shortly after an Amtrak crash in Philadelphia, according to multiple reports.
American Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and United all received letters from the Transportation Department asking for information on their prices both before and after the train crash. Flight prices on routes from Newark, John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Long Island MacArthur airports are among those being scrutinized.
""The idea that any business would seek to take advantage of stranded rail passengers in the wake of such a tragic event is unacceptable,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said on Friday, according to USA Today. ""This department takes all allegations of airline price-gouging seriously, and we will pursue a thorough investigation of these consumer complaints.""
The airlines have all denied raising prices to take advantage of the lack of transportation available after the crash.
On May 12, an Amtrak train going from Washington, D.C. to New York City crashed near Philadelphia, killing eight and injuring most of the rest of the 251 on board the train.
After the crash, trains throughout the Northeast were halted.
A week after the crash, Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, wrote a letter to President Obama requesting that he open an investigation, citing fares as high as $2,300 for flights between D.C. and New York."

The wage hike would be phased in, to take effect in New York City by Dec. 31, 2018 and by July 1, 2021 for the rest of the state.
That means that on Long Island, the minimum wage would be increased:
The board defines the term 'fast food chain' to include fast food establishments that are part of chains that have 30 or more locations nationally.
State Assemb. Kimberly Jean-Pierre, D- Babylon, called the the state board's recommendation a positive start in ensuring all workers are paid a living wage.
""This increase would provide much-needed relief to families across New York State who are working full time, yet remain in poverty,"" Jean-Pierre said.
The full text of the motions are available at: www.labor.ny.gov/fastfoodwageboard.
The state Labor Department explains the next steps:
According to statute, the Wage Board must now finalize and submit a report to Acting State Labor Commissioner Mario J. Musolino. The Board is scheduled to meet on Monday, July 27, to approve its report. The details of this meeting will be announced soon.
The Board's Report and Recommendations will then be published and followed by a 15-day public comment period. Comments will be accepted online and by mail.
Based on those comments, the commissioner may accept, reject or modify the board's recommendations and file a wage order. The wage order must be filed within 45 days once the report is filed. The order is then subject to an additional regulatory process.
