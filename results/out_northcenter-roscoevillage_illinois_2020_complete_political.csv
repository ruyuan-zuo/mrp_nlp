Over the weekend, they found ""no parking signs"" everywhere. CBS 2's Tara Molina took their concerns right to the city.
In an effort to discourage the services that a church continues to host during the stay at home order, the city of Chicago posted no parking signs all over this neighborhood. It's a move people who live there said really just affected them.

April 28, 2020
Dear Governor Pritzker,
During this unprecedented challenge to our state, you stressed multiple times your willingness and eagerness to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle and from every part of the state. As the women of the House Republican Caucus, we stand ready to offer solutions and work with you to implement a safe and reasonable regional plan to open Illinois. We are business owners, scientists, mayors, lawyers, community organizers, volunteers, officers, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, caregivers, and legislators. We represent 880,000 Illinoisans across all regions of the state—from the Chicago suburbs to regions in northern, western, eastern, southern, and central Illinois.
Our family members and constituents are fighting on the front lines as healthcare workers. We know and love people who are diagnosed with and suffering from COVID-19. We know, love, and represent people who lost their jobs, closed their small businesses, and exhausted their savings. For us, this is not political. This is personal.
We asked many questions concerning IDPH modeling, PPE procurement process and inventory, IDOC policies for transfers and releases, issues at IDES, safeguarding Long Term Care Facilities, and protecting state facilities for veterans and the developmentally disabled. We made many suggestions to promote physical and mental wellbeing, including opening state parks, locking down our prisons, housing our homeless, and protecting our most vulnerable populations. You did respond to our request for IDNR to open our state parks, thank you.
Unfortunately, a majority of our questions and suggestions are not acknowledged. We reached out to you, but you have not contacted one Republican woman legislator to discuss our concerns, suggestions, or solutions. We are writing to tell you as a matter of record the House Republican Women are here for Illinois. We are ready to offer suggestions, strategies, and solutions; and we are calling for the legislature to reconvene. We want to do our job as essential employees for our state and want to work with you to safely and regionally reopen our state.
SAFELY
● As elected officials, we have a responsibility to all Illinois citizens. Our number one priority as wereopen Illinois is to protect those who are vulnerable to this virus and ensure they have the appropriate support and necessary resources.
REASONABLY
● Illinois needs a reasoned and common-sense plan to reopen our state region by region understanding the virus affects each region differently. Some of these common sense steps include:
RESPONSIBLY
● Our constituents deserve a responsible government—a government where there are effective checks and balances and a government where all voices are heard. A responsible government means calling the legislature back to session.
REGIONALLY
● One size does not fit all. We must safely open our state on a regional basis. Other states including New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa proposed measured, regional reopening strategies.
We, the women of the House Republican Caucus, ask you to work with us. We are prepared to work on a serious plan to reopen Illinois safely, reasonably, responsibly, and regionally. We request you meet with us collectively as a group to share our ideas and offer solutions. We must continue to protect our vulnerable populations and safeguard our healthcare delivery systems, while we must also save our economy and our families. We are prepared to assist in developing and implementing a plan to safely get Illinois back to business reasonably, regionally, and responsibly.
Finally, as members of a co-equal branch of government, we request you call a special legislative session to start work on reopening Illinois safely and regionally.
We are ready and await a meeting with you.
Sincerely,
Rep. Avery Bourne
Rep. Terri Bryant
Rep. Amy L. Grant

The 47th Ward seat has been one of the most contested in Chicago, rivaled only by the 20th Ward, both of which headed into the Feb. 26 election with nine candidates.
The 47th Ward includes parts of North Center, Roscoe Village, Lincoln Square, Ravenswood and Uptown.
Martin and Negron were vying to replace outgoing Ald. Ameya Pawar, who served two terms in the ward.
_____________________
Martin is an attorney at the Illinois Attorney General's Office, where he focuses on issues including police reform, workers' rights, healthcare, LGBTQ rights, reproductive rights and immigration. Through his work, Martin helped draft the consent decree to hold the city accountable in reforming the police department.
Martin co-founded the Heart of Lincoln Square Neighbors Association and served on Pawar's Zoning Advisory Council.
Martin's priorities include fully funding schools, affordable housing and police reform.
Martin lives in Lincoln Square with his wife, Katelyn, and his son.
Martin has proposed reducing residents' reliance on property taxes by pursuing solutions such as graduated city income tax or a real estate transactions tax.
On March 24, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's Super PAC, Chicago Forward, began running attack ads against Martin.
Martin's campaign team said the ads misrepresented Martin's proposal and made up tax brackets that he never suggested.
""On February 26, our campaign came in first place with nearly forty percent of the vote, because voters want bold, independent leaders who will take on tough challenges and be honest with them."" Laura Reimers, Martin's campaign manager said.
""Michael Negron spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to earn barely four thousand votes. Now rather than talk about his own record as Rahm Emanuel's chief of policy, Negron and his allies are demonstrating their contempt for the voters by trying to mislead them. The voters want honest leadership and Michael Negron has proved he will not be an honest leader.""
""Over several months, I enjoyed sharing ideas with a crowd of thoughtful, committed candidates. This campaign has always been about bringing neighbors together to take on big challenges. I am disappointed that Michael Negron and his allies have resorted to misleading voters about my record, rather than engage in serious debate about the issues,"" Martin said.
In response, Negron said that his campaign ""has had nothing to do with, nor did we ask for, the Chicago Forward ads running in this race.""
Negron said that for months Martin has been the candidate ""who has spoken the most about a city income tax.""
""There is an ample record of statements by Matt about imposing this new tax on top of a state progressive income tax and using it to pay for a range of things from property tax relief to schools to pensions,"" Negron said.
""Moreover, the cities Matt has repeatedly pointed to as examples for a new city income tax are places where everyone pays, not just the wealthy. The moment voters started to push back his campaign began to back away from his previously stronger statements.""
Negron has been Mayor Rahm Emanuel's Chief of Policy for more than five years. Negron worked for Barack Obama's presidential campaign from 2007 until his election, and then went on to work as a staffer for Elizabeth Warren and serve in the Obama Administration. In 2011, Negron returned to Chicago to work for Emanuel.
Negron's priorities include investment in neighborhood schools, improving parks and infrastructure and enhancing public safety.
""Here's the truth — there are no one-sentence answers or easy solutions to any of our challenges,"" Negron said in a January forum held in Lake View. ""Our problems are complex and will take tough decisions in the years to come to address them.""

Michele Smith (43rd). Developers were seeking approval for a four-story mixed-use building at 2658 – 2670 North Lincoln Avenue. The development would include 36 apartments, 19 parking stalls and 2,240 square feet of ground-level parking space on the site of the Lincoln Park Gas Station, according to the community proposal.
This is the second time the Tempus Properties proposal for the site has been turned down — a former proposal was denied in 2017. The company has since lowered the number of apartments and parking spaces, but Smith said there were still zoning issues with the new proposal.
""Given this proposal falls within a transit-served location, it allows for reduced parking under Transit Oriented Development guidelines, and given the proposed development would merge two parcels into a single structure, they seek a zoning change from the current B3-2 designation to a B3-3 designation,"" the 43rd Ward posted.
The proposal also calls for residential duplex units on Seminary Street.

A poll and a speech may have hardened positions even further on both sides of the highly partisan and bitter state government impasse.
The speech, by Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, you likely already know about. The survey, taken by Gov. Bruce Rauner's pollster, you probably don't. So, let's start with the poll.
Basswood Research, which has done extensive work for the Rauner campaign, surveyed 800 likely Illinois general election voters September 14-15 and found quite a bit of support for Rauner and a whole lot of opposition to House Speaker Michael Madigan.
The poll, which had a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percent, found that 45.5 percent approve of Gov. Rauner's job performance, while 40 percent disapprove and 14 percent don't know. Not great.
But a whopping 71 percent agreed with the statement: ""Bruce Rauner is trying to shake things up in Springfield, but the career politicians are standing in his way,"" while just 21 percent said that wasn't true...

The news company filed the suit Thursday, accusing Mayor Rahm Emanuel of violating state open records laws. According to the Tribune:
The lawsuit, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, asks a judge to order the mayor to comply with a state Freedom of Information Act request from the Tribune and produce the documents. The lawsuit also seeks to have Emanuel declared in violation of the Illinois Local Records Act for failing to preserve emails and texts he sent or received while doing city business.
The lawsuit claims that, in recent years, Freedom of Information Act requests from the Tribune to the mayor's office ""have been met with a pattern of non-compliance, partial compliance, delay and obfuscation."" Emanuel's use of private phones and personal email, the lawsuit alleges, allows the mayor to do the public's business without scrutiny and contributes to a ""lack of transparency.""
The lawsuit is the second the news organization has filed against the Emanuel administration in recent months. In June, the Tribune sued the mayor's office over its refusal to produce some email chains related to a multimillion-dollar no-bid Chicago Public Schools contract now at the center of a federal criminal investigation.

Prescription drugs are directly linked to most, if not all, other drug addictions, officials say. Saturday's National Take Back Day for prescription drugs aims to prevent abuse.
""Prescription pain killers are the gateway to full blown heroin addiction,"" said Chuck Pelkie, spokesperson for Will County States Attorney Jim Glasgow. ""Young people start with parents' or grandparents' pain killers.""
Heroin is an epidemic in Will County and surrounding areas, as well as other places throughout the country. Glasgow ""has been on the cutting edge"" of fighting heroin addiction, both in aggressively prosecuting offenders, and prevention campaigns, Pelkie said.
""The more that people can do to keep the prescriptions out of the hands of their children. . .that kind of prevention is really the kind of prevention that helps people avoid addiction, and really saves lives in the long run,"" Pelkie said.
Prescription drug abuse is classified an epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is the nation's fastest growing drug problem.
In 2009, nearly one-third of people aged 12 and over began using prescription drugs non-medically, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
""According to the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, among people age 12 or older who reported using pain relievers non-medically in the past year, 70 percent got the drugs from a friend or relative (either for free, purchased, or by theft),"" said a fact sheet titled ""A Response to the Epidemic for Prescription Drug Abuse,"" on www.WhiteHouseDrugPolicy.gov.
On Saturday, people can take old or leftover prescription drugs to area collection sites from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. To find a local collection site, click here.
Here are some area collection sites open Saturday:
Many municipalities, such as New Lenox, maintain collection sites year round. In New Lenox, the site is located at the police department, 200 Veterans Parkway.
Proper disposal of prescription medication is one of a four-prong prevention plan outlined by President Barack Obama's administration. The other three are education, monitoring, and enforcement.
State Rep. Emily McAsey (D-Lockport) is encouraging people to participate.
""Most households have old medications that they don't necessarily know how to dispose of properly, and that can be dangerous if they get in the hands of young children,"" McAsey said in a press release. ""To ensure proper disposal, local law enforcement is conveniently providing free drop-off locations across our community to collect these old medications. I urge everyone to take advantage of this unique opportunity."""

As a young girl, Tina said while her father was away driving a truck, her mother would invite men in, get drunk and pass out. Then the men would come to ""play"" with her.

While laws have been enacted to deter pension spiking–a practice in which public employees nearing retirement are awarded pay raises to boost pension payouts –taxpayers continue to be saddled with artificially inflated pension costs.

They now are trying to recover that money.
