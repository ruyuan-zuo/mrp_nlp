Concerns over mass gatherings prompted Wednesday's announcement. In a May 27 letter to Temecula City Manager Aaron Adams, City Attorney Peter Thorson wrote, ""As of this date, the Governor's Executive Orders and the State Health Officer's orders would prohibit a July 4th fireworks show at Ronald Reagan Sports Park that involves the gathering of people in or near the park and surrounding streets.""
In a 3-2 vote on May 6, Temecula City Council chose to move forward with a July 4 fireworks show amid coronavirus challenges — provided the county and/or state did not ban the display. Council members Matt Rahn and Zak Schwank cast the dissenting votes. Read more: Temecula's July 4 Fireworks Show Will Go On, Despite Coronavirus
Since the council vote, Gov. Gavin Newsom has not lifted the state's stay-home order although he has eased many of its restrictions. The California Department of Public Health has issued guidance on gatherings, and has stated that all should be postponed or canceled, according to Thorson's letter.
Citing an inquiry to the CDPH by the city of Norco regarding an outdoor church service proposed to take place on 130 acres with an attendance of 8,000 people, Thorson provided the state's response to Norco: ""Mass gatherings are not permitted under the Stay-at-Home order.""
""The July 4th fireworks show, in which people are allowed to gather in-person at Ronald Reagan Sports Park, its parking lot or the surrounding streets, would be a 'mass gathering' and would not be permitted by the Governor's Executive Orders, the State Public Health Officer's Orders or the interpretations of these Orders by the California Department of Public Health,"" Thorson wrote.
Garden State Fireworks, the city's fireworks vendor, is working with the city and will apply the deposit for the July 4 display to a future show, date to be determined, according to the city.
On Tuesday, Lake Elsinore City Council voted 5-0 to go ahead with its July 4 fireworks display over the lake. Read more: Lake Elsinore To Hold July 4 Fireworks Show"

2,/california/temecula/worshipping-riverside-county-state-guidelines,2020-05-26T16:46:27Z,Worshipping In Riverside County: State Guidelines,1,5,City News Service,News Partner,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — Riverside County health officials said churches and houses of worship can reopen immediately in light of Gov. Gavin Newsom issuing statewide guidance on how they can safely reopen amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Under the guidelines issued Monday, places of worship must limit attendance to 25% of building capacity or 100 attendees, whichever is lower. This limitation will be in effect for the first 21 days of each county public health department's approval of religious services within their jurisdictions, after which the California Department of Public Health will review the limits.
They must also arrange for social distancing of at least 6 feet between people, establish and implement a COVID-19 prevention plan for every location, train staff and regularly evaluate workplaces for compliance.
""This is a significant step in the reopening process and we look forward to working with our places of worship with any assistance they need,"" said Fourth District Riverside County Supervisor V. Manuel Perez. ""A cornerstone of many religions is to take care of each other. Let's continue to take care of each other by praying and observing 6 feet apart.""
Riverside County Second District Supervisor Karen Spiegel said people of all faiths had been looking forward to this day.
""An important part of getting through this together is keeping our faith strong. By taking these safety precautions, we can choose to practice our faith in person again and do so safely,"" she said.
Other guidelines include:
-- Shortening the length of services;
-- Limiting visitation outside of scheduled services;
-- Discontinuing large gatherings, such as concerts, large holiday and life event celebrations;
-- Closing children's play areas and discontinuing activities for children where physical distancing cannot be maintained;
-- Propping or hold doors open during peak periods when congregants enter and exit;
-- Restricting the use of common areas, such as break rooms;
-- Reconfiguring podiums and speaker areas, office spaces, meeting rooms, conference rooms, etc., to allow for social distancing;
-- Face coverings;
-- Establishing directional passageways for foot traffic to help maintain physical distancing;
-- Removing pamphlet displays and bookshelves;
-- Limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time;
-- Discouraging handshakes, hugs and similar greetings;
-- Reconfiguring parking lots to create more space between vehicles;
-- Discontinuing potlucks or similar family-style eating and drinking events;
-- Discontinuing singing, group recitation, and other practices and performances where there is increased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets; and
-- Modifying practices that are specific to particular faith traditions that might encourage the spread of COVID-19 (such as the kissing of ritual objects and use of a common cup).
The guidelines also recommend reduced visitor capacity and staggered visitation times at funerals, wakes, weddings, and other events, if possible, and modifying religious or cultural practices when washing or shrouding bodies of those who have died from COVID-19, in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
""This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity,"" the guidelines state. ""Further, it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other related activities for those who are vulnerable to COVID-19, including older adults and those with co-morbidities. Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of the COVID-19 virus, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities such as singing and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing.""
The guidelines can be found here.
Attorney Robert Tyler, president of Advocates for Faith & Freedom and partner of the Murrieta-based nonprofit law firm Tyler & Bursch, LLP, said California's new guidelines for worship remain too limiting.
""While we appreciate the efforts made to allow places of worship to resume services, the guidance limiting occupancy to 25% or 100 people, whichever is less, is not acceptable because it still discriminates against places of worship,"" Tyler said. ""... While many churches will have no problem complying with the 100-person limit, some of our clients have churches that seat 2,500 people and more. Limiting places of worship to 100 people is arbitrary, unreasonable and unconstitutional. Our clients will continue to make plans to hold services on May 31, 2020, and many will not limit themselves to 100 persons."""

It's graduation time and unfortunately the events that our college and high school students, 8th graders, kindergarteners and many others have been eagerly working toward all year have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that includes canceling traditional graduations and grad nights, school dances and other large gatherings. These events and ceremonies are the focal point of the school year and of a student's academic career.
From Temecula to Fallbrook and Bonsall, to Valley Center, San Marcos and Escondido, schools and colleges at all grade levels throughout this region are grappling with new ways to recognize and honor hard work, dedication and achievement while safeguarding their students' and their families' health. In many cases, students and their immediate families are being invited to virtual graduation ceremonies that may include the usual pomp and circumstance, including decorated stages, guest speakers and diploma presentations, Some of these individual presentations will be photographed, videotaped and live-streamed. But virtual programs aren't a substitute for the real thing, and many schools are planning summer and fall gatherings complete with photo opportunities, yearbook signings and a chance for students to finally say goodbye and move on, surrounded by their family and friends.
Telling students that this pandemic is an historic, once-in-a-lifetime event (we hope) that they'll always remember may not help much right now. During this graduation season, our hardworking students deserve a shout-out from all of us, and in a small way, I'm happy to help.
If you and your graduating student would like to receive a State Assembly certificate recognizing this important milestone in their lives, please visit my website and send a request to me at: asm.ca.gov/75.

4,/california/temecula/coronavirus-reopening-riverside-county-waits-san-diego-gets-ok,2020-05-21T23:49:46Z,Coronavirus Reopening: Riverside County Waits,0,33,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — As Riverside County awaits news from the state to move into an expanded phase 2 reopening of the local economy amid coronavirus, its neighbor to the south was given a green light to do just that.
On Wednesday night, the state approved San Diego County's request to allow dining at restaurants and in-store shopping, both with social-distancing restrictions — something Riverside County has sought.
As of Thursday afternoon, San Diego is the only Southern California county to receive the state's variance. The county reports 6,315 COVID-19 cases and 241 deaths.
Riverside County now reports 6,343 cases and 284 deaths, an uptick from yesterday of 159 and 14, respectively.
Riverside County residents who've undergone COVID-19 testing stands at 93,101, which means the county is still below the state's 8% ""positivity rate"" — one of the criteria Gov. Gavin Newsom said was needed to move into an accelerated reopening. Hospitalizations continue to decline. The county reports 183 patients are undergoing care — 67 of them in ICU. Previous day's reporting showed 189 hospitalizations with 69 in ICU.
Riverside County residents who've recovered from the virus is now at 4,016.
As San Diego County restaurants work to reopen, they must adhere to county guidelines, including having tables six feet apart, having temperature screening of employees, requiring facial coverings on employees at all times and on customers unless they are seated. Reservations are encouraged.
Retail stores in San Diego County have similar restrictions, including limiting the number of shoppers in stores to maintain social distancing and requiring facial coverings for employees and customers at all times.
Jeff Rossman, president of the San Diego branch of the California Restaurant Association, urged diners to be patient with businesses, who were doing everything they could with limited supplies, information and staff.
""We encourage people to take their time,"" he said, noting he would open his own two restaurants the first week of June. ""Please don't come in if you're sick. Please be courteous, comply with signage and give yourselves extra time to comply. We've seen the long lines at casinos reopening, we don't want people queuing. Wait in your car if possible until your table is ready.""
San Diego County also sent a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom Tuesday night asking him to approve a pilot program for Phase 3 of the state's reopening plan. If approved, it could allow for the reopening of certain facilities, including youth and sports clubs, salons, fitness clubs and outdoor religious services.
In-person funerals, both indoors and outdoors, are now being allowed in San Diego County, provided every person in attendance wears a face covering and different household units maintain six feet of distancing from each other.
While houses of worship can open for funerals in San Diego County, they are a one-time situation. Any regularly scheduled religious services are still prohibited in person by the California's reopening guidelines.
The Riverside County Board of Supervisors had announced that Riverside, San Diego, San Bernardino and Orange counties were working together to persuade the governor to allow an accelerated phase 2 reopening on a regional level. Besides San Diego County, the nearest county allowed the variance is Santa Barbara.
According to the supervisors, Riverside County boasts one of the highest per-capita testing rates in California. But the county also has generated the second-highest number of cases and deaths in the state, second only to Los Angeles County.
Newsom said Monday that the state may significantly ease restrictions in the next few weeks, and that roughly 53 of the state's 58 counties would likely qualify to move deeper into phase 2 of the state's recovery roadmap.

In a 5-0 vote, the board accepted a $431 million Coronavirus Aid, Relief & Economic Security Act distribution from the U.S. Treasury Department. The vote formally set aside $150 million for obligations running to June 30, with an immediate $50 million designation to fund programs that aid businesses impacted by the governor's stay-at-home order and other state and county regulations that forced private sector entities to close to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The grant is retroactive to March 1 and is intended to be expended by Dec. 31, according to documents posted to the board's agenda.
Officials said the balance of the grant — $281 million — will roll over into the 2020-21 fiscal year, starting July 1.
""The county received a direct allocation from the federal government as we are the tenth largest (county) in the nation by population,"" according to an Executive Office statement. ""County leadership continues to work with state and federal partners to interpret eligible uses of this CARES Act funding.""
According to the EO, the county Emergency Operations Center has already identified $40 million in expenses that qualify to be offset using the CARES funding.
The federal money can be utilized for expansion and maintenance of virus testing, supporting staff at public health clinics, providing assistance to ""congregate care"" facilities including nursing homes, purchasing personal protective equipment for health care facilities and businesses, funding sanitation operations in county detention centers and securing hotel and motel rooms to shelter homeless individuals, who are considered part of the ""vulnerable population"" amid the virus crisis.
No money can be expended to ""backfill"" the county's budgetary losses stemming from drops in tax revenue directly related to regulations implemented because of the virus.
Officials said 16 regional hospitals have incurred sizable expenses tied to COVID-19 treatment and response, and will be in line for reimbursements drawn from the CARES grant.
The county Emergency Operations Center will be accepting and assessing inquiries related to relief funding.
The Executive Office stressed that the CARES money will be held in trust because ""federal funding is tied to rigorous oversight, so segregated budgeting and accounting is paramount."""

Governor Newsom's May Revise budget projection for the coming Fiscal Year shows that the $21 billion surplus we had has become a $54 billion deficit in our state budget!
The economic activity that generates tax revenues supporting state programs has collapsed because of Covid-19. We are now in a serious recession, with unemployment levels greater than those of the Great Depression. It is imperative that we safely open up our economy to reduce the hit on our economic outlook and help Californians recover.
I've joined a group of western state leaders asking the federal government to provide funding to help make up this shortfall and support public safety, local governments, schools, hospitals and Medi-Cal. Unlike the federal government, California cannot print its own money. State tax revenues have decreased, while the demand for state services, including unemployment insurance, has increased exponentially.
Safety is essential. We've learned a lot over the past months, and protocols like social distancing have allowed essential businesses to remain open. Thousands of customers safely visit local big box-stores each week; there's no reason those same protocols can't be used by smaller businesses with far fewer customers.
A regional approach is best as local county health authorities should make the call. Many businesses have learned to think outside the box, and they should be given the chance to open safely. We've been saying we're all in this together, but in thousands of cases, small businesses have been forced to carry the heaviest burden.
From public safety (fire season is upon us) to education, from highway funding and Medi-Cal to programs for the elderly, the disabled and handicapped, all state programs are facing disastrous cuts. The social costs of allowing our shutdown to become a depression are incalculable. By using caution and the lessons we've all learned, California's economy can safely reopen.

Gavin Newsom and state officials that it is ready to ""cautiously and safely"" reopen for business based on public health data, it was announced late Friday.
In a May 14 letter and ""attestation"" to the governor and officials, Riverside County supervisors said the county has the ability to ""meet, exceed or plan to achieve"" all but one of the criteria required to accelerate through the state's current stage 2 reopening of the economy.
The criteria the county cannot immediately meet is the ""epidemiologic stability of COVID-19,"" which requires zero COVID-19 deaths and no more than 1 case per 10,000 people in the past 14 days.
In the letter, the county asks for a variance on that criteria. ""In our opinion, the metrics are unrealistic for urban counties, and Riverside County in particular, where our geographic size and population make it impossible that no"" COVID-19 death would take place during the 14-day period.
Instead, the letter states, ""it is appropriate to adopt the federal epidemiology benchmarks,"" which the county said it is already achieving because of a downward trend in data.
The county and state are currently in stage 2 of the governor's reopening plan, which allows for curbside delivery and pick up of some retail businesses. With the letter and attestation, the county is requesting to move to the governor's accelerated stage two, which could reopen additional businesses.
To support the request, the Board of Supervisors on May 12 unanimously approved its Readiness and Reopening Framework, which officials described as a ""commonsense plan"" that meets both goals of protecting our public health and restoring the economy.

John Crater was appointed to division chief for the city of Temecula, effective May 11, it was announced Wednesday.
Crater replaces Interim Division Chief Bill Weiser, who stepped in temporarily to serve Temecula. Weiser will now resume his post as Division Chief for Bautista/San Jacinto.

announce Chief Crater brings 26 years of frontline public safety expertise to Temecula,"" said Temecula Mayor James ""Stew"" Stewart.
According to the city, Crater started his firefighting career in November 1994 as a volunteer firefighter at Station 9 Good Meadow in Riverside County. He was hired in 1999 by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), San Diego, as a seasonal firefighter in Deluz. In 2001, he began serving as a permanent firefighter II for the Riverside Unit in the Lake Elsinore battalion. He also worked in Battalions 2 and 13 as a fire apparatus engineer.
In 2008, Crater was promoted to fire captain in the Lake Elsinore battalion and worked at
Stations 11, 61, and truck 97. In 2017, he accepted a promotion to battalion chief working
in the cities of Desert Hot Springs and Lake Elsinore.

Gavin Newsom will grant Riverside County a green light to reopen its economy on a fast track under his ""regional variance"" program, local officials aren't standing idle despite state and county restrictions.
Instead of defying orders, the city is looking for opportunities to back the county's efforts and possibly reopen Temecula as a ""subregion."" On Tuesday, Temecula City Council members unanimously approved a 39-page ""Community Recovery and Reopening Plan"" that provides local businesses and organizations with guidance on reopening amid coronavirus. The outlined plan aligns with state and county orders, and is a living document that can be updated based on changes and community feedback.
While the plan may seem benign, its intent is not. Councilmember Matt Rahn said the document shows the city is doing its due diligence.
In a May 13 letter to the county introducing the plan, the five council members advocate that Temecula, nearby Wine Country, and the city of Murrieta already meet Gov. Gavin Newsom's criteria to reopen under his regional variance program.
The governor's program is a fast-track to reopening for counties, not cities, if they meet stringent criteria, including hospital capacity that can accommodate at least a 35% surge in COVID-19 cases; proper PPE and protections for hospital workers; no more than 1 COVID-19 case per 10,000 residents in the last 14 days; no COVID-19 deaths in the last 14 days; minimum daily testing of 1.5 people per 1,000 residents; at least 15 contact tracers per 100,000 residents; ability to temporarily house at least 15% of the county's homeless; proper protection for employees returning to work (protective gear, sick time); at least a 14-day supply of PPE at skilled nursing facilities; and the ability to tighten county restrictions if needed.
It's not clear if Newsom will make allowances for cities under his regional variance program, but he has signaled there is some flexibility.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Temecula has 119 coronavirus cases and zero deaths. The data provided to the public by the county is somewhat opaque though. For example, it doesn't give breakdowns-by-city on the age groups of those infected, what type of facility they live in, and whether they are hospitalized or self-quarantined at home. Moreover, information about contact tracing is not provided.
The city of Murrieta has five coronavirus-related fatalities and 108 cases as of Wednesday afternoon. The county data doesn't provide any information on the ages or underlying health conditions of those who died.
Temecula argues in its May 13 advocacy letter that the city ""is in the recovery phase of the disease curve.""
""We have experienced a decline in the number of COVID-19 patients that require hospitalization over the past month, we have more than sufficient hospital and critical care beds, and adequate supplies of PPE,"" the letter reads.
The city is prepared to resume stricter public health measures if there's an uptick in the number of confirmed cases or a lack of capacity within the hospital and health care system, according to the letter.
""We also acknowledge that public health measures may change rapidly on the recommendations and orders of public health officials and the State, and it is incumbent upon the City and community to remain flexible in adjusting any reopening efforts accordingly,"" the letter reads.
Given the governor's stringent regional variance criteria, ""the only opportunity for meaningful forward progress in our community at this point is for the State to either change its criteria for acceleration or allow our County to approve accelerated plans by subregions within the County,"" the letter continues.
The city of Temecula is pushing forward, as outlined in the letter. ""Working with surrounding counties in similar situations through coalitions, our professional associations for cities and counties, and other community and industry stakeholders, can lead to this change.""
According to the letter, Temecula deems all of its businesses and houses of worship as essential.
Residents and business owners can submit comments on the reopening plan to the city clerk at randi.johl@temeculaca.gov. The city council is scheduled to review the comments during its May 26 meeting.

We all miss going out to eat, seeing our family dentist and sporting events. Small businesses have taken a huge hit, and we must ensure they recover. The Governor just released Phase 2 reopening, based on successes with social distancing and smoothing the curve.
California's economy should reopen quickly. By using social distancing and other protections, most businesses can reopen while keeping customers safe. As a member of the Joint Task Force on Business and Jobs Recovery, I'll be working on initiatives to help restore California's economy. First of all, the state should Improve its small business loan program to provide forgivable loans to businesses that cover payroll, rent, health insurance premiums and other costs. Secondly, we need to provide unemployment insurance (UI) relief for small businesses. The huge spike in UI applications will also increase UI taxes paid by businesses. California businesses have already lost billions -- they shouldn't be penalized because the government ordered them to shut down and lay off workers.
Many businesses took advantage of federal Paycheck Protection Program loans, which provide forgivable loans to small businesses under certain conditions. Under federal law, the loans are not taxable, but under California law, they are. Those loans should be exempt from state income taxes.
We also need to take action to suspend enforcement of new rules and regulations if they are unrelated to COVID-19 and don't impact health and safety. Other initiatives would shield businesses from lawsuits over COVID-19 exposure, including essential businesses that remained open, along with removing hiring barriers by suspending AB 5.
This unprecedented emergency will have long lasting repercussions. But now it's time to focus on recovery. If you'd like to share your thoughts about the pandemic, please visit my website to take a short survey at: ad75.asmrc.org.

The rescinded orders previously executed by Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser include: social distancing, face coverings, restrictions on golfers, and barring short-term rentals except as emergency shelter for vulnerable people.
The supervisors decided against rescinding an order mandating all schools stay closed through June 19. Instead, they amended it to include only K-12 schools. Vocational schools and higher education systems are no longer ordered closed by the county.
No other county health orders are in place.
The supervisors also agreed the county will ""strongly recommend"" residents and businesses follow a yet-to-be released ""Principles For a Safe and Accelerated Reopening of Riverside County"" outlined by Supervisor Kevin Jeffries that offers health guidelines and best practices amid COVID-19. The principles will not be mandated by the county.
With Friday's vote, the county no longer has orders more restrictive than those imposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
The marathon board meeting was a continuation from Tuesday. Over the course of both days, more than 200 people turned out to publicly comment on the issue. Supervisor Jeffries said he received more than 600 emails.
Most of the public commenters were in favor of dropping the local health orders and many pushed to fully reopen the county, despite the governor's stay-home order.
Banning Mayor Daniela Andrade and Banning City Council Member Art Welch told the board their constituents are struggling.
""People are slipping close to collapse,"" Andrade said. ""The city of Banning is seriously hurting.""
Ninety percent of Banning's businesses are family owned, according to Welch. Ten have already ""collapsed"" during the shutdown, he said.
Kim Stellrecht, owner of Locals Public House eatery in Riverside, pleaded with supervisors to reopen the economy. Drive-up service for customers is not bringing nearly the income needed to make ends meet, she said. Stellrecht closed in-dining on March 17 and told the supervisors she is not getting a rent break.
""I'm watching my dreams flushed down the toilet,"" she said tearfully. ""How do I survive?""
Many speakers asked the board to defy Gov. Gavin Newsom's stay-home order. Several unmasked commenters who were sporting patriotic T-shirts, caps and scarves, invoked religion, calling the governor's order an unconstitutional ""lockdown.""
Some speakers discounted modeling and data provided by Riverside University Health System-Public Health officials and said immunocompromised and elderly people should quarantine while ""healthy"" people return to ""normal life.""
Carlos Adame, of Murrieta's Adame Landscaping, pleaded that face masks are causing a health hardship for his 200-plus employees who are struggling to get oxygen while working in temperatures now approaching triple digits.
""It's very hard for them,"" he said.
At least one man who identified as a doctor and three people who said they were nurses expressed concern about the public face mask order, saying the practice is unhealthy and offers little to no protection against virus spread, especially by people who aren't trained on proper face mask use.
Kristie Sepulveda-Burchit, executive director of Educate Advocate, also pushed to lift the local health orders arguing masks cause more health harm than good.
Not everyone agreed. A 28-year-old caller said she was a COVID-19 survivor and is still ailing with respiratory problems. Tearful-sounding, the caller asked, ""What is economic value without the value of human life?"" Another caller said he attended a Zoom funeral Thursday for a COVID-19 patient. ""It can change your universe,"" he said.
On the issue of school closures, Board Chairman V. Manuel Perez said he received a letter signed by all county school district superintendents and the Riverside County Office of Education urging the supervisors keep school closures in place ""to buy time"" so a countywide reopening plan can be implemented. The move suggests Kaiser will have flexibility to extend the order if needed.
Darrell Peeden, vice president of the Moreno Valley Unified School District board, was against rescinding the orders. He advocated for deferring to health experts, and called for the formation of a county education task force to ensure reopening of schools is done safely and in concert with health experts.
All the supervisors sympathized with the public speakers and said they are eager to reopen but are bound by state orders. They expressed disappointment at Newsom's phase 2 regional variance program that could allow counties to further expand reopening beyond what he allowed this week.
Although the regional variance criteria won't be fully detailed until Tuesday, the governor highlighted some of the key benchmarks the county would need to first achieve before an expanded reopening could take place: hospital capacity that can accommodate at least a 35% surge in COVID-19 cases; proper PPE and protections for hospital workers; no more than 1 COVID-19 case per 10,000 residents in the last 14 days; no COVID-19 deaths in the last 14 days; minimum daily testing of 1.5 people per 1,000 residents; at least 15 contact tracers per 100,000 residents; ability to temporarily house at least 15% of the county's homeless; proper protection for employees returning to work (protective gear, sick time); at least a 14-day supply of PPE at skilled nursing facilities; and the ability to tighten county restrictions if needed.
Perez called the governor's benchmarks unattainable.
""There is no way we can meet the threshold,"" he said.
The supervisors also signaled they may partner with neighboring counties to work toward a regional ""phase 2.5"" reopening that the governor might be more inclined to sign off on."
12,/california/temecula/decision-face-masks-distancing-expected-friday-rivco,2020-05-08T18:08:09Z,"Decision On Face Masks, Distancing Expected Friday",1,33,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — Riverside County may learn Friday whether certain local public health orders imposed due to coronavirus will remain in place or be rescinded.
The board of supervisors is convening a special meeting Friday at 1 p.m. to reassess whether to nix county orders requiring social distancing, use of face coverings, ongoing limitations on golfing, keeping schools shuttered, and barring short-term rentals except in cases of providing emergency shelter for vulnerable people. Viewers can tune into the board meeting here.
The supervisors may be better equipped to make a determination now that the governor has provided some direction. The board held a nearly nine-hour-long hearing Tuesday to receive public testimony regarding the restrictions' impacts and weigh their value compared to the state's mandates. The hearing ended without a vote for lack of consensus -- and concerns that Gov. Gavin Newsom might make modifications that merit keeping local requirements in place. Related: Face Coverings, Social Distancing Continue In Riverside County
Newsom and the California Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, on Thursday broadly outlined the changes under phase two of the governor's multi-point plan for reducing regulations and restarting the state's economy, while stressing the virus is no less dangerous. Related: Reopening Begins In Riverside County As Coronavirus Lurks
The changes do not add to the state mandates in place for residents conducting everyday affairs, but they do call for workplace adjustments as businesses reopen. The county's restrictions are still stricter, and several supervisors on Tuesday signaled a desire to end the elevated regulations in favor of complying solely with the state's requirements.
According to Ghaly, under the phase two guidelines, retailers, manufacturers and warehouses will be able to return to semi-normal operations while adhering to protective measures, including providing personal protective equipment to employees, namely gloves and face masks. Social distancing requirements will be necessary, and with respect to retail outlets, they will initially only be able to service customers through pickups and deliveries -- not in-store activity, the doctor said.
He said for phase two to expand and allow more businesses to open, counties will need to show COVID-19 testing involves 1.5 screenings per 1,000 residents, and that infections are down to 1 case per 1,000 residents in a 14- day period.
Supervisor Jeff Hewitt asked for the special board session to examine the state's new guidelines and debate what to do with the county's remaining emergency health orders, signed by county Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser.
Board Chairman Manuel Perez and Supervisor Karen Spiegel originally proposed the regulatory rollback, which would end requirements on social distancing, use of face coverings, ongoing limitations on playing golf, keeping schools shuttered and barring short-term rentals.
Kaiser last week signed orders keeping many regulations in place until June 19.
Perez backed off his earlier support, opining that it would not be in the county's favor to ""abandon guidances"" from the health officer and Riverside University Health System staff. He felt that the ongoing restrictions might fit ""hand in glove"" with whatever the governor proposed in his expanded multi-phase plan. Spiegel agreed.
Hewitt said he wanted to end the county's restrictions, comparing the debate to a discussion about ""how to inflate the inflatable life raft, when there are already so many people drowning.""
""There are horrible tragedies for business owners and employees,"" Hewitt said. ""We are not gods of who opens and who doesn't.""
Hewitt denounced data that had been put before the public on the severity of COVID-19, noting that the figures cited by Kaiser and other RUHS staff -- projecting 1,000 virus-related deaths by May 1 -- had been ""greatly exaggerated.""
The supervisor's sentiments were echoed by Sheriff Chad Bianco and Treasurer-Tax Collector Jon Christensen, both of whom advocated ending county-level restrictions.
""I work with numbers, and none of the numbers from this pandemic have panned out,"" Christensen told the board.
The tax collector said county revenues are tumbling and the business community is steeped in fear.
Bianco, who spoke without a mask, told the board he was opposed to the ""elimination of constitutional freedoms.""
""We need to rely on facts and data, not projections and fear,"" the sheriff said. ""The danger of the virus is significantly lower. The original projections that caused the health orders to be put in place have been proven wrong. This cannot be the new normal.""
Riverside-area salon owner Adrian Bermudez characterized the face coverings mandate and other county requirements as ""medical tyranny.""
Many who addressed the board were not wearing face coverings, as still required by the public health officer's mandate. Violating the health orders can result in misdemeanor charges and financial penalties.
""Wearing a mask spreads the message that this (virus) is dangerous,"" Chris Nelson told the supervisors. ""Stop operating under fear and operate under facts and statistics so that we can once again revive our freedom."" Related: Face Coverings, Social Distancing: What To Know In RivCo
About a third of the speakers, many of them affiliated with unions, defended the county's restrictions.
Jurupa Valley Unified School District Superintendent Elliott Duchon told the board that Kaiser's order keeping schools shuttered to June 19 was ""an effective tool in stopping the virus.""
Palm Springs Mayor Geoff Kors praised face coverings, saying they will be needed as a protective measure when businesses start to reopen.
""I'm in favor of keeping the rules in place as more people are visiting businesses,"" he said.
Newsom on Thursday chastised those who think the threat of the coronavirus has dissipated, noting that 92 more deaths were reported between Wednesday and Thursday.
""I'll remind people that think, `Hey, the emergency's over, we can go back to the way things used to be' -- I've heard some comments from people that are even in elected office saying that -- tell that to 92 families that were destroyed because they lost a loved one to this virus in the last 24 hours,"" Newsom said. ""This by no stretch of the imagination is over. We want to contain this spread. We are making real progress in this state because you all practiced physical distancing, you abided broadly by the stay at home order, but we are not out of the woods.""
The board granted Kaiser unfettered authority to issue public health mandates when it declared a local emergency on March 10.

13,/california/temecula/riverside-county-readies-partial-reopening-friday,2020-05-07T22:16:50Z,Riverside County Readies For Partial Reopening ,2,55,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — As Riverside County, its cities, and many of its businesses and residents grapple with budget shortfalls amid coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom said that retail, manufacturing and logistics may reopen Friday but with modifications to operations.
Riverside County confirmed it is following the governor's lead by allowing local businesses within these sectors to reopen Friday per the state's criteria. The county is not adding additional restrictions beyond what the state has imposed.
The governor also said he will be unveiling plans Tuesday for a ""regional variance"" program that allows counties to expand reopenings beyond the three sectors if strict thresholds are met.
Newsom's announcements came during a Thursday news briefing, in which he said the economy will begin slowly reopening in ""Phase 2"" of his four-part recovery plan, but he warned, ""This is not a return to normal. COVID-19 is still spreading.""
An updated ""Resilience Roadmap"" has been posted on the state's coronavirus response website. The portal provides specific guidelines for the retail, manufacturing and logistics sectors, as well as updated guidelines for 14 other sectors.
For example, curbside retail can begin Friday. The types of businesses that can reopen include but are not limited to: bookstores, jewelry stores, toy stores, clothing stores, shoe stores, home and furnishing stores, sporting goods stores, antique stores, music stores and florists. Supply chains supporting these businesses in the manufacturing and logistical sectors can also reopen, albeit with certain restrictions.
In terms of reopening more than just the 17 sectors, Riverside County will need to meet certain conditions first, some of which it already has. The types of businesses and organizations that might be allowed to reopen under the state's Phase 2 ""regional variance"" plan include offices, restaurants with dining, shopping malls and outdoor museums.
Although the ""regional variance"" criteria won't be fully detailed until next week, the governor highlighted some of the key benchmarks the county will need to first achieve: hospital capacity that can accommodate at least a 35% surge in COVID-19 cases; proper PPE and protections for hospital workers; no more than 1 COVID-19 case per 10,000 residents in the last 14 days; no COVID-19 deaths in the last 14 days; minimum daily testing of 1.5 people per 1,000 residents; at least 15 contact tracers per 100,000 residents; ability to temporarily house at least 15% of county's homeless; proper protection for employees returning to work (protective gear, sick time); at least a 14-day supply of PPE at skilled nursing facilities; and the ability to tighten county restrictions if needed.
The governor suggested there could be flexibility in the regional variance program, but it's unclear if COVID-19 caseloads and death counts might be an obstacle for Riverside County. As of Thursday afternoon, the county reported 4,756 COVID-19 cases, an uptick of 84 over the last 24 hours. The death toll reached 192, an increase of six since Wednesday.
The Riverside County Board of Supervisors has signaled it will abide by state mandates but it wants to fully reopen the local economy as soon as possible.
In a released statement following Thursday's Sacramento news briefing, Riverside County Board Chair and Fourth District Supervisor V. Manuel Perez said, ""Governor Newsom announced a limited move into stage two of the four-stage economic reopening plan, allowing gradually for more modes of commerce to resume, with modifications. As a county, we stay focused on the mission of achieving progress across multiple benchmarks of public health and meet the capacity to eventually get more sectors of the economy reopened. With that said, I look forward to working with Public Health and the Economic Recovery Taskforce to ensure a cautious reopening through this phase and into the next phases.""
During a marathon meeting Tuesday, the supervisors grappled with whether to rescind county public health orders that require social distancing, use of face coverings, ongoing limitations on golfing, keeping schools shuttered and barring short-term rentals, except in cases of providing emergency shelter for vulnerable people.
After more than eight hours, the supervisors unanimously voted to continue the discussion to Friday at 1 p.m. in the hope there would be more clarity from Sacramento. Viewers can tune into the board meeting here.
Treasurer-Tax Collector Jon Christensen advocated ending county-level restrictions during Tuesday's meeting, and he warned, ""We're in trouble financially as a county, as a state.""
Reflecting back on the Great Recession, Christensen said, ""This is going to make 2008 look like a walk in the park. We have to reopen — time is of the essence.""
This comes as Riverside County is planning budget cuts to all county services due to lost revenues tied to state and county COVID-19 restrictions.
""Every department and every service — funded by the General Fund aka your tax dollars — will be impacted,"" Supervisor Kevin Jeffries posted Wednesday on social media. ""All department heads will be notifying the CEO (and board of supervisors) of the impacts and cuts. The first two rounds of cuts will likely total over $100 million plus. The board (in my opinion) will need to conduct triage and determine which services will need to be (mostly) preserved more than others. Be assured — it will be unpopular and ugly."""

Council members Matt Rahn and Zak Schwank cast the dissenting votes.
Council members debated options put forth by staff that included canceling the traditional event and instead putting on a virtual summer shindig. Online festivities like music and fireworks, along with virtual participation by residents — selfies, recipes, contests, etc. — would replace in-person celebration.
Council member Mike Naggar mocked the idea, saying he couldn't imagine people gathering around a screen on July 4.
""It's thoroughly ridiculous,"" he said.
Invoking ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" Naggar said it is symbolic that Temecula proceed with the annual patriotic event amid COVID-19 obstacles.
Mayor Pro Tem Maryann Edwards agreed. ""Watching fireworks on TV is like watching bowling,"" she said. Pressing on with the fireworks display ""sends a message of hope.""
Council member Matt Rahn questioned the wisdom of shelling out funds on a fireworks show amid fiscal uncertainty and other unknowns caused by COVID-19.
The cost of the fireworks is $40,000, which doesn't include ancillary expenses such as security, a radio station broadcast to coincide with the fireworks display and other costs, according to Dawn Adamiak, Temecula Community Services Department. She estimated the show's total tally would reach somewhere around $80,000.
""The cost of hope cannot be counted,"" Naggar countered. ""We're not cancelling the Fourth of July. The fireworks have to go on.""
The city plans to make Ronald Reagan Sports Park available for July 4 revelers, unless the county or state issues orders restricting the opening.
Naggar maintained that Temecula residents can social distance, if that is still called for by July 4.
According to council members, Temecula is the only Southwest Riverside County city to move forward on a July 4 display.
In its motion to OK the fireworks display, council members instructed staff to ensure contracts with vendors allow flexibility in case the state and/or county prohibits the event. If the county and/or state objects because of social gathering, council members instructed that Ronald Reagan Sports Park could be cordoned off, if necessary.
Unlike years' past, the city will not hold a July 4 parade."

Governor Newsom recently announced creation of the first-in-the-nation ""Great Plates Delivered program,"" which will partner with cities, counties and Tribes to deliver food to older adults.
The program will provide nutritious meals to older Californians who should stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic. By partnering with local restaurants struggling to stay afloat, the program keeps restaurant workers employed, and seniors will stay safely at home without risking their health at the local supermarket.
Participants must be 65 or older and considered high-risk because they have coronavirus or were exposed to it, or have underlying health conditions. Participants must also live alone or with another eligible adult and can't be enrolled in other federal nutrition programs. Incomes can be no more than $74,940 for individuals or $104,460 for two. How can I enroll into the program if I believe I qualify? Each local administrator will establish a streamlined process to enter into the program and will conduct a screening process to ensure individuals meet program criteria.
Meals will be served three times a day, seven days a week, and restaurants will be reimbursed up to $66 dollars each day -- $16 for breakfast, $17 for lunch and $27 for dinner. An additional $5 will go for ""incidental expenses."" Locally produced food from independent restaurants will be emphasized, along with a diverse selection of meals. Food must be low in sodium and options must include fruits and vegetables.
So who pays for all this? The federal government will reimburse 75% of the cost, with the state reimbursing local governments for 75% of their costs.
The program is new, and specifics about how to enroll should be announced soon. Once the program is fully up and running, you will be able to call 2-1-1 for details, or you can monitor the state's website at: https://covid19.ca.gov/img/wp/great-plates-delivered-participants-faqs.pdf

16,/california/temecula/4-health-orders-riverside-county-likely-be-lifted,2020-05-01T02:36:12Z,4 Health Orders In Riverside County Lifted: Vote,7,145,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — The Riverside County Board of Supervisors is poised to consider whether to rescind four county public health orders currently in place amid coronavirus.
The county orders that mandate face coverings and physical distance of six feet between individuals; place limitations on short‑term rentals; put restrictions on reopened golf courses; and close schools are all scheduled to expire June 19. Riverside County Board Chair V. Manuel Perez and Vice Chair Karen Spiegel are bringing forth a proposal Tuesday to rescind them all ahead of time.
The county orders were put in place by Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser, who has maintained the restrictions are necessary to protect public health and prevent a surge of COVID-19 patients who could overwhelm local hospital systems.
The proposal by Perez and Spiegel will be voted on at the Riverside County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday. If approved, Riverside County will not have any countywide orders more stringent than Gov. Gavin Newsom's statewide ""stay-at-home"" order, which will remain in place.
According to a news release issued Thursday by Perez' office, the proposal is ""an effort to transition to economic and social recovery and streamline layers of public health requirements on coronavirus.""
""I want to thank Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser who has led the charge with actions that have no doubt made a measurable impact in saving lives in our county,"" Perez said. ""His early and proactive leadership got us very far ahead as a county. That, combined with data and strong economic arguments, is why I have the confidence that it is appropriate to lift these measures while we continue to align ourselves with the state's stay-at-home order and roadmap for reopening.""
Perez continued, ""Our data and metrics show that we have conducted over 50,000 tests at five locations, which is two percent of our county's population. We prepared for the expected hospital surge with two Federal Medical Stations that we have not had to use. Our hospital bed and ICU bed use have remained relatively consistent. These data explain why our original modeling has changed.""
Spiegel said, ""We've successfully bent the curve of the disease. Sadly, the rise of unemployment sharply continues. These actions will ensure that we are ready to reopen business as soon as the governor lifts the statewide restrictions.""
County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser on Wednesday extended the county's emergency health order mandating social distancing practices and requiring face coverings for residents when outside their homes. Read more: Face Coverings Mandated Through June 19 In Riverside County
""For the immediate future, this is the new normal in Riverside County,"" Kaiser said.
Kaiser's previous health orders were due to expire Thursday, but he signed an amended directive with a few modifications, while keeping in place local mandates that are not required by the state, including the use of face coverings.
Kaiser's revised directive is also keeping the countywide shutdown mandate in place for all public and private schools, including colleges and universities, until June 19.
Along with Kaiser, the California Department of Public Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to recommend the use of face coverings, social distancing and frequent hand washing to reduce the likelihood of contracting COVID-19.
The proposal from the two supervisors reads:
Direct the Director of Emergency Services and Public Health Officer to Rescind the Following Public Health Orders:
a) April 1, 2020, Amended Order of the Health Officer Closing All Schools, Community Colleges, Colleges, and Universities from March 16, 2020 through June 19, 2020; and,
b) April 2, 2020, Amended Order of the Health Officer Related to Short Term Lodging Facilities through June 19, 2020; and,
c) April 29, 2020, Amended Order of the Health Officer for the County of Riverside and the Director of Emergency Services Placing Restrictions on Golf Course Use; and,
d) April 29, 2020, Amended Order of the Health Officer for the County of Riverside and the Director of Emergency Services requiring the use of face coverings and practice of social distancing.

It took about four hours of discussion Tuesday night for council members to hash out whether to reopen parking lots at city parks and how to get local businesses humming while restrictive state and county orders are in place.
As a resort destination that touts $1 billion in annual tourism revenues, Temecula has been hit hard by the shutdown. During Tuesday's night's virtual city council meeting, Temecula City Clerk Randi Johl read aloud 54 public comments from residents and business owners who weighed in on the closure.
More than half were in favor of some form of reopening the city: A dozen Calvary Baptist Church parishioners urged that if people can gather at Walmart, they can gather for in-person religious services. Several winery owners maintained that patrons can safely visit vineyards while adhering to social distancing orders. Wilson Creek Winery owner Bill Wilson called the shutdown, his ""9/11"" moment. More than 100 Wilson Creek employees have been furloughed, and the federal government's small business loan program has not delivered promised relief, Wilson said. A recreational tennis player begged the city to reopen courts at local high schools so he can keep his mind and body healthy.
Not all commenters were in favor of reopening before state and county health officials deem it safe. Many Harveston Lake residents complained that ""visitors"" are flocking to their neighborhood, flouting state and county orders about gatherings and face coverings. The residents implored the city to stop the alleged violators. A mother pleaded against a ""premature"" reopening.
After listening to all comments, the council members first took on the issue of parking lots at the 41 city-owned parks. In an unanimous vote, council members agreed to reopen all lots except those at ""destination parks"" that include Ronald Reagan, Patricia H. Birdsall, and Harveston Lake.
Parking at the city's two dog parks will reopen.
Frustration was apparent though. Council member Mike Naggar wanted all parks' parking lots reopened, arguing that most Temecula residents are adhering to state and county orders.
""The preponderance of people are practicing social distancing,"" he said. Naggar conceded there are a few ""knuckleheads"" who won't comply, but said closing one parking lot and not another was illogical.
""We've got the go-ahead,"" he said, referring to the county public health officer's April 20 announcement that parks and respective parking lots could reopen.
But concerns about overcrowding at the three destination parks, and how to enforce state and county orders at the facilities, prevailed.
""We do have a responsibility to maintain [the] public health,"" said council member Zak Schwank.
Depending on how reopenings at the smaller parks go, parking lots at Ronald Reagan, Birdsall, and Harveston Lake may be opened as well, council members said.
Playground equipment remains closed at all city parks under the county's current order, although tennis and pickleball are now allowed at Margarita Community Park and Pala Park.
Discussion on how to move forward with a citywide plan to reopen businesses ran into the early morning Wednesday. Council members were in agreement that the city and its business leaders ""need a seat at the table"" when it comes to crafting county guidelines.
The governor has been giving counties leeway during the shutdown. For example, Riverside County has worked with the state to determine what is an essential or non-essential business, and local officials were able to carve out modifications like reopening golf courses and drive-thru religious services. But the council members said the criteria has been fuzzy.
""It doesn't make any sense,"" Naggar said. Council member Matt Rahn said the city is not getting enough information about the decision-making process of what can open and what cannot.
In an effort to gain more control moving forward, council members unanimously voted to authorize City Manager Aaron Adams to draft a plan that includes input from local businesses on how they might reopen while still adhering to state and county orders. The document would then be brought to the county, including the two county task forces charged with reopening the economy. Riverside County Supervisor Chuck Washington is specifically working on a plan to revive District 3, which includes Temecula.
The council will review the city manager's document during its next meeting.
Mayor James ""Stew"" Stewart asked City Attorney Peter Thorson whether Temecula could just reopen despite state and county orders. ""What would happen?"" he asked. Thorson signaled that it would not be advisable, given the financial cost of fighting such a battle during a time when revenues are sharply down.
Council members said they were determined to come up with a viable plan to reopen while still adhering to orders.
Naggar said that if the shutdown lingers for another 30 days, ""everything is going to collapse. I do not think we have the luxury of waiting.""

18,/california/temecula/sentencing-delayed-duncan-hunters-wife,2020-04-28T20:10:44Z,Sentencing Delayed For Duncan Hunter's Wife,0,5,City News Service,News Partner,"TEMECULA, CA — Sentencing has been delayed another month for the wife of former Rep. Duncan Hunter, who pleaded guilty along with her husband to federal conspiracy charges for misusing campaign funds to support years of personal expenditures.
Margaret Hunter was slated to be sentenced next Monday, but the hearing was postponed to June 8, which will be nearly one year since she pleaded guilty to using campaign credit cards on family vacations, restaurant and bar tabs, clothes and other frivolous expenses over the course of several years.
Prosecutors say the couple spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, with the former congressman falsely reporting the expenses as campaign related.
Duncan Hunter, whose congressional district included part of Temecula, pleaded guilty about six months after his wife and was sentenced earlier this year to 11 months in federal prison. He's slated to surrender to authorities on May 29.
In a joint motion filed last week by prosecutors and Margaret Hunter's attorneys, both parties cited COVID-19 considerations in requesting a delay. The public health crisis has pared down federal court proceedings, with many hearings suspended in the interest of slowing the spread of the virus.
U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Whelan approved the joint continuance request on Monday.
The Hunters were charged in 2018 in a 60-count indictment.
At Duncan Hunter's sentencing hearing, he asked Whelan for leniency and sympathy when he sentences ""the mother of my children,"" asking the judge not to give her time in custody ""if it's possible.""
In the prosecution's sentencing memorandum, it states the Hunters were ""virtually penniless"" and amid dire financial straits, resorted to using campaign credit cards to support ""a profligate lifestyle leading to continual debt and an ever-increasing need to find cash to pay bills.""
Despite the family bank account not carrying a positive balance throughout any single month between 2009 and 2017, prosecutors say the family lived extravagantly, racking up thousands of dollars on expensive family trips and scores of other improper personal purchases, according to the memorandum.
Prosecutors also say in court filings that Duncan Hunter gave his wife a campaign credit card despite her having no official role in the campaign, and later hired her as campaign manager amid protests from members of his staff."

August marks a huge milestone. In 1920, women were granted the right to vote nationwide when Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment. The amendment reads: ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.""
Just to be clear, millions of women had already been voting. Fifteen states had granted women full suffrage, and limited voting rights had been granted in another twelve. In some states like Colorado and Oklahoma, women's suffrage passed by elections that were only open to male voters.
In California, women received the right to vote in 1911, and in 1918, four women were elected to the State Assembly. Nationally, the first woman elected to Congress was Jeannette Rankin of Montana in 1916. A strong supporter of women's suffrage, she voted for the 19th Amendment in 1918.
Even after passage of the 19th Amendment, voting rights did not include all women. Women of color were not allowed to vote in some parts of the country until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Today, women serve at all levels of leadership in our state and nation, including governors, congressional representatives and senators. In the California Legislature, I serve as Assembly Minority Leader, along with Toni Atkins, Pro-Tem and Shannon Grove, Minority Leader, both in the Senate.
The 19th Amendment passed Congress in 1919 with bi-partisan support – over 80% of Republicans and 50% of Democrats supported the measure in both houses.

21,/california/temecula/scathing-rivco-grand-jury-report-response-committee-formed,2020-08-25T20:38:11Z,Scathing RivCo Grand Jury Report: Response...,0,0,City News Service,News Partner,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — The Riverside County Board of Supervisors Tuesday approved formation of a committee to respond to a civil grand jury report that found a $36 million contract between the county and accounting firm KPMG was largely wasteful.
County CEO George Johnson affirmed that his executive office would ""take the lead in the response,"" but he asked for two board members to scrutinize the staff's work to be certain ""we're covering the right topics before bringing everything back to the full board for review.""
Supervisors Kevin Jeffries and Jeff Hewitt volunteered to serve on the committee, and the entire board agreed in a 5-0 vote.
""The grand jury is pointing at the Executive Office,"" Supervisor Kevin Jeffries said. ""Only the Executive Office can answer these questions.""
The committee will assess what the civil grand jury uncovered during its months-long investigation into the KPMG contract and provide point-by-point responses by Nov. 10.
The 19-member grand jury returned with a report on Aug. 12 detailing what it described as questionable actions on the part of the executive office in securing the KPMG work, as well as a range of doubts that the Netherlands-based professional services firm's actions had really netted the savings and workflow improvements that it claimed.
KPMG was initially hired in the fall of 2015 to examine operations within public safety departments, notably the Sheriff's Department and the District Attorney's Office, to determine what changes might be necessary to make them more efficient and less costly. The original contact cost was $761,600.
In March 2016, the EO recommended, and the board agreed, to retain KPMG under a long-term compact to help public safety agencies implement modifications aimed at enhancing efficiency.
The agreement was amended several times — without competitive bidding — to include evaluations and revisions to practices and procedures in general government agencies, including the Animal Services, Human Resources and Information Technology departments.
The total cost of KPMG's work eventually ballooned 54 times the original contract expenditure to $36.4 million.
Supervisors Marion Ashley and John Tavaglione, both of whom retired at the end of 2018, were stalwart supporters of the contract, while Supervisor Kevin Jeffries and then-Sheriff Stan Sniff were openly opposed, routinely casting doubt on the need for such a significant commitment of county taxpayer dollars, which might otherwise have been invested in bulking up the sheriff's patrol force.
When the KPMG contract closed in June 2019, Jeffries acknowledged that KPMG had ""found what we wouldn't have if it had been left up to us.""
KPMG executives stood by their work, saying it was incumbent on the county to see that reforms were enacted. There was particular emphasis on the County Performance Unit, and the need to monitor progress within each department. But as the civil grand jurors noted, the CPU ""has been largely abandoned.""
The grand jury was dubious about claims that the contract had resulted in $100 million in savings from workflow changes, mainly in public safety, over a two-year period.
According to the investigation, the EO represented that lower discretionary appropriations — $89 million — for the sheriff and DA during two fiscal years comprised most of the savings. But the grand jury concluded that, after specific documents were not provided, ""claimed savings to the sheriff's and district attorney's offices since implementation of KPMG's recommendations lack validation.""
The jury also questioned whether KPMG efficiency recommendations had led to improvements in sheriff's ops, or the restoration of funds previously cut from the sheriff's budget had paved the way to enhanced work patterns.
""No documented evidence of specific cost savings was provided to the grand jury by the EO or the sheriff's department,"" the jury stated.
Jurors found that the Department of Human Resources had benefited from changes that centralized recruiting to fill county positions, but in the Department of Information Technology, KPMG made recommendations concerning operational changes that the agency had already implemented, and officials said the firm's ""work was not helpful to the IT department,"" according to the report.
Jurors also took issue with the EO crediting KPMG with a program to supply all Department of Animal Services officers with tablet devices to improve their fee collection efforts in the field. The change had been recommended by other entities, according to jurors, who said it was ""misleading"" to attribute the reform to the vendor.
The jury recommended that ""key performance indicators"" outlined under the CPU be more closely watched to document efficiencies and savings by agencies.
The panel additionally said the county needs to ensure competitive bidding is involved in all contracts over $500,000, pointing out that the KPMG's agreements were repeatedly amended without the county giving any thought to inviting competitors.
Jurors lastly said the board should re-examine, in total, the initiatives put in place under the KPMG work to ""achieve benefits and cost savings,"" and that the board consider establishing a new ""independent department,"" similar to the Office of the Auditor-Controller, to measure to what extent agencies are following through with reforms and what the county is gaining.

""While the grand jury found some limited evidence of cost savings and other benefits, no evidence was provided that the KPMG County Transformation Project came close to paying for itself,"" the grand jury report found. ""There still may be considerable savings and other benefits to be derived if the county follows up on recommended initiatives from the project. However, unless and until new savings and benefits are realized, there is more justification to label the project wasteful rather than beneficial.""
The ""KPMG County Transformation Project"" was initially approved by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors in September 2015. At that time, the county agreed to pay international accounting and consulting firm KPMG $761,600 to find efficiencies and cut costs in public safety services, including the sheriff's department, the district attorney's office, the public defender's office, and the probation department.
Over the next two years, the contract was amended to pay KPMG millions more to find savings and inefficiencies in 20 additional county departments, including the executive office.
In total, the county agreed to pay KPMG $36.4 million for its services.
The 2019-2020 Riverside County Civil Grand Jury report entitled ""KPMG County Transformation Project: Benefit or Millions Squandered?"" also found other expensive missteps, including the attempted implementation of a Workday computer system in Human Resources that was canceled and cost the county ""at least an additional $8 million.""
The grand jury also found that the county abandoned a key initiative to track performance by departments and the board of supervisors, despite promising to do so. The county ""has not followed-up on KPMG recommendations that could yield further savings and efficiencies,"" the report found.
Evidence provided to the grand jury by the county's executive office to support completion on some of KPMG's recommendations ""was incomplete, dubious, misleading, or not provided at all. Thus, the veracity of information provided to the board is questionable,"" the report found.
Moreover, even though the cost of the KPMG contract expanded to more than 54 times the size of the original September 2015 agreement, the county sought no additional bids for any of the amendments, the grand jury report found.
The county also paid KPMG ""a considerable hourly rate for tens of thousands of hours of work without quantifiable deliverables,"" which was in conflict with board policy, the report found.
There was some ""limited cost savings"" from the KPMG County Transformation Project in the county's purchasing and fleet services departments, but not so in other departments, according to the report.
"" ... assertions by the [executive office] to the board of supervisors of greater savings exceeding the cost of the project have not been supported and are questionable,"" the report found.
The grand jury report recommends that the board of supervisors ""direct, track, and report on departments continuing implementation of KPMG recommendations."" The report also recommends that the county establish an independent agency, such as an internal audit department, to track management, completion, and results of similar projects.
In the future, before the board makes large amendments to professional services contracts, it must first put the projects out for competitive bids, the report also recommended.
The sheriff as well as supervisors on the Riverside County board have 60 days to respond to the report. The Riverside County Executive Office has 90 days to respond."
23,/california/temecula/riverside-county-elementary-schools-can-now-seek-reopening,2020-08-21T22:54:51Z,Riverside County Elementary Schools Can Now...,2,68,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — Riverside County school children have not been in classrooms since March, but on Friday the county confirmed that schools serving transitional kindergarten through grade 6 may apply for a waiver to reopen amid coronavirus.
The ""school waiver"" option was announced earlier this month by Gov. Gavin Newsom, but the program launch was left to the discretion of local public health officers — and it remains that way per state guidelines.
In Riverside County, TK-6 schools will have to submit their reopening plans and other documentation to Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser. After consultation with state health officials, Kaiser will determine whether a school can reopen. The waivers are not guaranteed and can be withdrawn, according to county documents.
Additionally, if the number of waiver applications is too high to allow for ""appropriate monitoring,"" then some schools may have to be ""phased in"" or ""deferred"" for reopening, the county said.
""The biggest predictor of school spread is community spread, and although we're still finding new cases of COVID-19, our case rate has dropped enough where we can consider elementary school waivers,"" Kaiser said. ""However, the waiver process won't be a rubber stamp, and elementary schools will be required to publicly demonstrate they have the pieces in place to operate safely or they won't be approved. We want exposures to be rare and, should an exposure occur, for the school to show they can handle it without putting others at risk.""
It's not immediately clear how many Riverside County schools will apply for a waiver to reopen. Most districts have reopening plans in place, and some districts may want to offer a hybrid learning model that incorporates in-person and online education. Classrooms modifications like plexiglass dividers, mandated face masks for faculty and older students, constant sanitization, social distancing and other safety measures are part of districts' plans.
Not everything is within the public health officer's control. The county's coronavirus infection rate will also impact decision making on waivers.
""Waiver applications will not be accepted if the countywide [coronavirus] case rate is 200 or higher per 100,000 population, as determined by CDPH [California Department of Public Health],"" according to the county.
As of Friday, the CDPH reports Riverside County is at 170 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents.
As for kids older than grade 6, the waiver program is not yet available to their schools.
""Only elementary schools in the transitional kindergarten through grade 6 (TK-6) grade span are eligible,"" county documents show. ""If the same educational institution offers TK-8 or TK-12 education, then only grade levels 6 and below may resume in-person instruction if the waiver is granted. Standalone middle schools with 6-8 education, and all standalone high schools, are not eligible for application.""
Dr. Erica S. Pan, California state epidemiologist and deputy director for the Center for Infectious Diseases, has said data suggests younger children are at lower risk of transmitting COVID-19.
The waivers, she said, are intended to prioritize young school kids and create flexibility for ""certain parts of our state that are in a grayer area.""
Riverside County has been in the ""grayer area"" for some time. It remains on the state's COVID-19 ""monitoring list,"" which prevents reopening. The only Southern California county that has fallen off the list is San Diego. The county may start reopening all schools as soon as Sept. 1 if it remains off the list.
Riverside County must be off the watch list for 14 days before schools and school districts may reopen without a waiver.
Schools, both public and private, can obtain a waiver application on the Riverside University Health System-Public Health website or by clicking here.

Schools are essential and the need to educate our children is not negotiable. The 2020-21 budget package maintained school funding based on 2019-20 attendance levels, which essentially placed a funding cap on all schools, even those experiencing high levels of growth.
Prior to enactment of this year's education trailer bill (SB 98), school districts were ""held harmless"" over declining year-to-year enrollment. If the district lost students, it would still be funded at last year's level. If the school added students, it would receive more money. But under SB 98, a growing school does not generate more money. If the school has 10% or even 100% more kids, it receives funding based on the same number of students it served last year
Each student typically generates an average of $10,300 through the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). A recent analysis projects LCFF costs that are more than $500 million lower than the amount budgeted in 2020-21 due to this change in attendance funding. Let me be clear – this money for schools was included in the budget, but unless the law is changed, growing schools will not receive it. These restrictions fall on charter schools as well as traditional schools in areas experiencing rapid growth, such as southwest Riverside and north inland San Diego Counties in my District. Conversely, areas not experiencing much growth, like Los Angeles and San Francisco, may see little impact.
That's why I joined many of my Assembly colleagues in a letter to Governor Newsom asking that this funding formula be revised. In his budget-signing message, the Governor indicated that he recognized problems with this formula and that changes would be necessary.
The money for schools was included in the budget. It's imperative that we change the law to ensure funding for all our growing schools.

A major side effect of the Coronavirus pandemic is the immense impact on California's mental health and substance use. Over 22,000 overdoses and suicides are projected to result from forced isolation and rising unemployment.
Parity means substance abuse and mental illness needs to be treated equally as physical health. 90% of those with substance use disorders, and almost 60% of mentally ill adults go untreated. California's 21-year old Mental Health Parity Act increased access to treatment by requiring insurers to cover medically necessary services. Though the Act was a big step forward, the law has become inadequate, loopholes exist, and an update is necessary.
Senate Bill 855, which I am co-authoring with Senator Scott Wiener (D – San Francisco) modernizes the Act by bringing it into conformity with modern practices. The Act currently requires insurers to cover ""medically necessary"" services, but fails to define exactly what that means. It also covers only nine severe mental illnesses and excludes all substance use disorders, like opioids, and most mental health conditions.
SB 855 incorporates recent federal court rulings and American Medical Association recommendations to ensure that health plans cover these treatments, including preventative and diagnostic care, SB 855 will reduce the enormous public cost of untreated substance abuse and mental illness, which include costs related to law enforcement, the court system, homelessness, Medi-Cal expenses, and many other public programs.
SB 855 is supported by over 60 leading organizations, including the California Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists, and the California Narcotic Officers Association, to name just a few.
SB 855 passed the Senate and is now in the Assembly, where it just passed the Health Committee. The bill has bi-partisan support, and prospects for final passage look bright.

The pandemic has thrown millions out of work and created massive problems at California's Employment Development Department (EDD), the agency empowered to provide Unemployment Insurance (UI) to laid-off workers.
Between March and May, EDD experienced a 3400% increase in claims compared to January/February. From March 8 to July 18, EDD processed 8.7 million claims, including 6.8 million standard UI claims and 1.4 million Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) claims. The agency has paid out a total of $49.7 billion in benefits, and reports that 94% of requests for assistance have been approved.
These numbers are impressive, but mask huge problems. The state's 120 legislative offices often become the last resort for people unable to contact EDD or to get anything resembling a timely response to repeated emails, phone calls and faxes. EDD receives about 700 cases weekly from legislative offices, and even though the number of staff dedicated to handling these requests increased from 1 to 93, it can still take a month or more to get a reply to our inquiries. This is unacceptable.
Recently, the Governor announced a series of actions aimed at transforming EDD, modernizing technology and improving communications to ensure EDD prioritizes the oldest claims so that badly needed UI benefits get to unemployed Californians who still must pay their bills.
I have long called for modernization and improved technology in state agencies. And based on our experience dealing with just under 1000 EDD inquiries from constituents since mid-March, my office has been working as a liaison from our whole caucus to EDD and the Department of Labor to seek solutions that result in faster responses and fewer glitches.
California's workers are hurting and EDD has not been up to the challenge. This must change, now!

Several employees in the Capitol and 2 Assemblymembers tested positive for COVID last month which stopped our work in its tracks. This week marks the start of a short, final month for the 2019 – 2020 session.
Public safety is a priority, and I am very proud to join Assemblymembers Cooper, Bonta and Gonzalez to co-author AB 664. The March 4 state of emergency declaration requires all peace officers, firefighters and health-care workers to remain on the job -- for our protection. Since this places them at heightened risk, we must do all we can to protect them. AB 664 provides full hospital, surgical, medical, disability indemnity and death benefits to all peace officers, firefighters and healthcare workers who contract COVID-19 while performing their duties. The bill has bipartisan support, and sponsors include the Los Angeles Police Protective League, California Professional Firefighters, and the California Nurses Association.
Another important bill is aimed at helping small businesses. As a small business owner myself, I know how difficult it is to keep up with changing laws and regulations. During this time of forced shutdowns, it's even more difficult. SB 1457, introduced by Senator Borgeas, requires state agencies to help small businesses comply with ever-changing statutes and regulations, and reduces or waives civil penalties for some violations. The bill also establishes the Office of Small Business Advocate within the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GOBIZ), and requires all state agencies that significantly impact or regulate small business to designate at least one person as a small business liaison.
During this emergency, we must do all we can to protect our first responders, and to assists small businesses trying to stay afloat and keep employees working. Bills like AB 664 and SB 1457 will help.

The DMV has extended the time for drivers license renewals that had expired during the period of March 2020 on. All drivers under age 69 were extended until July 31 with expanded online renewal available. Commercial license renewal extended until Sept. 30, 2020. Learners permits from March 2020 also extended 6 months. This is good news for many.
My office has been contacted by many people over age 70 with concerns about their expiring driver licenses. State law requires those over 70 to visit the DMV in person to renew their licenses. Since appointments are not currently available, how they can renew their license amid worries over possible exposure to the Coronavirus. Fortunately, the DMV has just announced that drivers over 70 will have their licenses extended for a full year from the original expiration date. No action is necessary – it's automatic -- all police agencies have been notified. TSA has also been notified, and will accept recently expired driver licenses or ID cards without a paper extension.
DMV offices have now reopened statewide after being closed several months. Some DMV functions, such as behind-the-wheel tests are still not being offered because of social distancing concerns. Once DMV has worked through appointments canceled due to the pandemic, new appointments will soon be offered. And if you're concerned about getting Real ID, the federal government has extended that deadline to October 1, 2021.
Many tasks can be accomplished online, or at one of DMV's self-service kiosks located throughout the region. Address changes, title transfers and release of liability, replacement stickers, and more, can all be taken care of with a quick visit to the DMV's website: https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/

34,/california/temecula/it-was-chaos-illegal-fireworks-spark-action-riverside-county,2020-07-15T16:40:58Z,'It Was Chaos': Illegal Fireworks Spark Action ...,5,154,City News Service,News Partner,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — The Board of Supervisors Tuesday directed Riverside County public safety officials and Executive Office staff to work on strengthening fireworks regulations to prevent a repeat of the enormous number of violations that occurred on the Fourth of July.
""It was the most number of illegal fireworks going off I've ever seen,"" Supervisor Kevin Jeffries said in making the proposal for increased penalties. ""It was chaos.""
Jeffries was joined by Supervisor Karen Spiegel in calling on Sheriff Chad Bianco, Fire Chief Casey Hartman and Executive Office attorneys to possibly revise county Ordinance No. 858, which sets fines for fireworks violations between $500 and $1,000, as well as establishes the grounds for misdemeanor charges.
Jeffries, a former firefighter, said he was both incensed and astonished by the number of fireworks being lit in so many places during the Independence Day holiday weekend. He said blazes resulted from pyrotechnics near Lake Elsinore, in Mead Valley and around Lake Mathews.
""I'd like it if we don't repeat this on New Year's or next (Independence Day) as best we can,"" the supervisor said.
Bianco said the cancellation of public fireworks shows due to coronavirus concerns influenced many residents in their decisions to ignite their own supplies.
""I think companies got rid of their stockpiles by selling to the public,"" the sheriff said. ""We were overwhelmed with illegal fireworks calls.""
Bianco said that on July 4, the Sheriff's Department received 8,668 emergency and non-emergency calls related to pyrotechnics. Deputies responded to less than half of them because they were so over-extended, according to the sheriff.
Moreno Valley had the highest number of calls countywide at 1,328.
Another problem was reckless gunfire ostensibly tied to Fourth of July celebrations, according to Bianco.
""There were plenty of irresponsible people out shooting guns because they had no access to fireworks,"" he said. ""That's a much greater danger because the rounds go up and they must come down. There was some damage with vehicles hit, but there were no injuries.""
The sheriff said about 80 people were arrested for fireworks violations.
""The availability of illegal fireworks is becoming more prevalent,"" he said. ""We need some kind of planning event to convince people they need to do something else.""
The sheriff also advocated for ""major civil fines"" that can be imposed on violators.
""It's one thing to leave someone with a citation, but it's another if they receive a $3,000 fine,"" Bianco said.
Supervisor Jeff Hewitt expressed hope that next year, Independence Day celebrations would be back on track, lessening the likelihood of illegal fireworks activity.
""It's been such a bad year,"" Hewitt said. ""So many people felt like, `Hey, we're going to do (a fireworks celebration) anyway.""'
There was no word on when the proposed revisions to 858 might be submitted.
The measure expressly prohibits the sale, storage and transportation of fireworks without a permit. County residents are allowed to use pyrotechnic devices in Blythe, Coachella, Desert Hot Springs and Indio, where so-called ""safe and sane"" fireworks can be sold to the public.
The devices, which must meet state fire marshal certification, generally do not explode or fly and include ground spinners, fountains, snappers and caps."

In California, opioid and heroin use is a major threat to public health, and is the leading cause of death for those under 50. It's a major cause of crime, and contributes directly to high recidivism rates in our prison system.
That's why I've introduced Assembly Bill 1304 (AB 1304), co-authored by Senator Tom Umberg (D – Santa Ana), which will provide Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for eligible parolees who volunteer to participate. MAT is an innovative treatment program that uses medications combined with counseling and behavioral therapies to treat substance use disorders. Findings reported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse clearly show that providing criminal offenders with substance use treatment reduces drug abuse, crime and reincarceration. In addition, by following the prescribed MAT regimen, death rates from opioid overdoses can be cut by more than half.
Under AB 1304, incentives to participate in the program will include reductions in length of parole. Parolees will be screened, and only those deemed eligible will be allowed into the program after they've served their prison sentences. A similar program was started In Kentucky in 2016, with proven results that include an overall drop in recidivism, along with reduced illegal drug and alcohol use. California's costs will be minimal, since the program will be supported through a State Opioid Response Grant, provided by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration.
The costs associated with drug abuse are incalculable. Crime, homelessness, lost job productivity, broken families, suicides, are all part of the massive societal cost of drug abuse in our state and nation. We can help drug-addicted criminal offenders re-enter society as productive citizens by removing them from the cycle of addiction and dependency. In this time of huge budget deficits, we can also reduce the costly burden of recidivism on the state's corrections system.

The news came the same day that the number of new coronavirus cases in the county reached another single-day high. Read more here.
""Virtual methods have been long-standing and efficient ways to conduct business with the county. As one of the largest employers in the area, the county family is dedicated to providing high-quality services in a safe manner for our employees and visitors,"" County Executive Officer George Johnson said.
""Departments have diligently worked to add these safeguards to workspaces, including providing more telecommuting options. Returning to virtual means is one way the county is slowing the spread of the disease,"" he said.
The County Administrative Center will be closed to public access for an unspecified period starting Monday, along several other county buildings, which officials did not immediately identify.
County services will still be available for residents over the phone or online.
Essential facilities providing health services, public safety services, as well as cooling centers, will continue to be open. County libraries will continue to offer curb-side services.
The latest closure announcement comes a week and a half after the County Administrative Center partially closed at the end of June -- a week after fully reopening -- due to several confirmed coronavirus infections in the building.
Because of a public health order, the CAC had been mostly closed to the public between March 18 and June 15, when all offices were reopened to the public.
Some county employees will work from home, or if necessary, continue working in the office while maintaining social distance from other co-workers and wearing face coverings, officials said. When employees arrive at work, they will be screened for coronavirus symptoms.

In a 5-0 vote without comment, the board authorized the compact until June 30, 2025, when it will expire, or the parties decide to continue it.
""Riverside County and the San Diego County Fire Authority will benefit with the automatic aid agreement by securing automatic aid in fire protection, in the protection of life and property from fire, and in firefighting for the residents and visitors of both areas,"" according to a county fire statement posted to the board's policy agenda. ""With the increased fire potential, which is predominately due to the water drought, both parties will be better prepared for the fire season, or any emergency each party may potentially face.""
Riverside County maintains automatic aid agreements with several jurisdictions, but this is the first such compact with San Diego County.
The agreement specifies that either fire agency could be called upon to send resources to wildfires on either side of the county line — up to five miles inside their respective jurisdictions.
""However, neither party shall be required to reduce its own fire protection resources, personnel, services and facilities to the detriment of its normal fire protection capability,"" according to the compact.
Aid requests will have to be mutually acknowledged before crews and firefighting equipment are dispatched, officials said. In Riverside County, the Perris Emergency Command Center will be the controlling authority. In San Diego County, it will be the Monte Vista Inter-Agency Emergency Command Center.
Generally, neither fire agency will be responsible for costs incurred by the other in meeting obligations established by the accord, but there may be exceptions, including when specialized equipment is put to use and some maintenance is required during extended deployments, according to the terms."

Independence Day is traditionally a time to go to the beach, have backyard barbecues and close out the day watching fireworks. But this year, the celebrations won't be as wide-spread, the beaches will be much less crowded. The limited July 4th activities may be appropriate since it provides an opportunity to pause and reflect on what the day is really about.
244 years ago, a group of agricultural colonies with a population of less than 3 million, scattered along the coast from Canada to Florida, with no army or navy, decided to declare its independence and take on the world's greatest empire. Victory was improbable, but miraculously, the colonists won. They wrote a Constitution that enshrined the visionary ideal that free people should be able to direct their own affairs. While everyone wasn't included – slaves remained slaves until ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, and women weren't allowed to vote in most states until ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, it was a start.
But July 4th 1776, started it all. The Declaration of Independence declared that: """"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights..."" These were revolutionary sentiments. To declare all men equal, to state that human beings are born with rights granted by God and not by monarchs, and for leading citizens to risk their lives by putting all this in writing, must have seemed crazy.
Today, we should remember the truths from our Declaration of Independence, and from the Constitution, that enshrine our inherent rights. Independence Day is not just a big summer holiday -- it's a day to celebrate our rights as a free people.

40,/california/temecula/trashy-sw-riverside-county-freeways-litterbugs-coronavirus,2020-09-03T22:40:13Z,"Litterbugs, Coronavirus Collide On SW Riverside...",0,26,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"SOUTHWEST RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — The amount of litter gathering alongside Southwest Riverside County freeways and highways suggests a whole lot of people are OK with using the roadways as their personal garbage bin.
The unfortunate storm of litterbugs and coronavirus has the Southwest region looking pretty trashy.
COVID-19 Impact
Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it wasn't uncommon to see work release crews from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department picking up roadside trash in the Southwest region and elsewhere. That program, however, was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to Terri Kasinga, public and media affairs chief for Caltrans, District 8.
Collaboration between Caltrans, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and advocacy groups (to provide occupational mentoring and temporary employment to parolees and veterans in litter abatement) was also impacted by the coronavirus shutdown — as was litter removal by Caltrans crews.
As traffic began increasing with statewide coronavirus re-openings, however, so did trash accumulation along freeways and highways. In June, it was announced that Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol were partnering to resume cleanup of the state's littered roadways.
Local cleanup is happening, but it's slow and litterbugs outnumber crews.
""Caltrans crews are working now to remove litter in high volume trash areas on I-15 in Temecula, Murrieta, Wildomar, Menifee, Lake Elsinore and Corona,"" Kasinga said.
But the cleanup will take time, with Caltrans maintenance crews incorporating roadside litter pickup into their work schedules approximately two days a month. It will take ""a month or two"" before the Southwest Riverside County area looks cleaner, Kasinga estimated.
There is no word on when work release crews might resume trash pickup.
Personal Responsibility
Caltrans and other agencies have conducted anti-littering campaigns, but they often fall on deaf ears.
""People make split decisions to litter or they get lazy. Then it becomes an issue for a lifetime,"" Kasinga said. ""All the campaigns in the world seem to not be working on folks in California. Education starts with children and then maybe saying something when people see others litter. Caltrans is doing its best with the resources we have available to try and keep up with it — but everyone needs to pitch in to see a change.""
The CHP enforces California's anti-littering laws, ticketing motorists who litter or drive with unsecured cargo loads. Last year, the CHP issued more than 3,100 citations statewide for littering, and roughly one-third of those violations involved a lit cigarette, according to Caltrans.
""Not only is littering illegal, but there can be devastating consequences resulting from these senseless actions,"" said CHP Commissioner Warren Stanley. ""A lit cigarette carelessly tossed from a window can start a brush fire, an unsecured cargo load can result in a collision, and the safety of a highway worker cleaning up the mess is at great risk.""
Caltrans collected 287,000 cubic yards of roadside litter in 2019 alone — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks, the agency said. Of that total, 35 percent of the cleanup was from the agency's community volunteer programs.
The Adopt-A-Highway program provides an opportunity for individuals, organizations and businesses to help maintain sections of the state highways. Since its start in 1989, Adopt-a Highway volunteers have removed litter from more than 15,000 miles of roadway shoulders and helped maintain 36 acres of wildflowers, 1,540 acres of vegetation management, and 111 acres of tree planting, according to Caltrans.
Caltrans Director Toks Omishakin said in June that cleaning up litter is not just the responsibility of a government agency. ""Litter increases the risk of fire, pollutes our waterways, threatens wildlife and costs taxpayers millions of dollars to remove. We ask all Californians to be part of the solution, dispose of trash responsibly and secure cargo loads before getting on the road."""
41,/california/temecula/registrar-mail-ballots-preferred-voting-person-ok,2020-09-02T21:03:39Z,"Registrar: Mail-in Ballots Preferred, But...",0,14,City News Service,News Partner,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA—Mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 general election will be going out to all registered voters in Riverside County in just under five weeks, but Registrar of Voters Rebecca Spencer said that in-person voting will still be permitted with precautions.
""We're encouraging all voters to fill out their vote-by-mail ballots and only go to the 'vote centers' if they need assistance,"" Spencer said. ""Voters who never received a ballot, made a mistake and voided their ballot, or who may need audio or bilingual help — those are the voters we would like to see at the vote centers.""
She further noted that individuals who choose to vote in person are not required to wear a mask. Federal law prohibits interference with exercising civic rights except under specific conditions. However, social distancing and sanitation protocols will be enforced, the registrar said.
According to Spencer, an executive order by the governor and additional action by the Legislature in response to the coronavirus pandemic requires the Office of the Registrar of Voters to make absentee ballots available to all of the roughly 1.2 million registered voters in the county.
In-person voting must still be available, though, and the county will operate 120 vote centers, beginning Oct. 31. The centers are analogous to polling stations. Additionally, 80 vote-by-mail ballot drop-off locations will be open three to four weeks ahead of election day, according to Spencer.
The drop-off sites include libraries, senior centers, community centers, municipal and county offices, where registrar staff will routinely retrieve ballots deposited into secure receptacles, Spencer said.
She said the California Secretary of State's Office has established a new ""ballot trax"" system that allows voters to confirm that their mail-in ballots have been processed. More information will be available on the voting guides that the county will begin distributing via mail later this month. Absentee ballots will be sent starting Oct. 5, according to Spencer.
Because of the temporary regulatory changes under California's state of emergency, Spencer said mail-in ballots will still be counted if they're received within 17 days of election day. The previous deadline was three days after election day.
All ballots must be postmarked on or before Nov. 3, she said.

California has already reached historic levels in acres burned - 700 fires with over 1.3 million acres burned! As always, California's first responders are on the job, protecting our lives, our property, our families, everything we hold dear. We owe them our cooperation, our respect and our support.
Last winter's heavy rainfall generated a huge amount of fuel in our arid region. Now that summer is winding down, that fuel is dry and just waiting for a spark. With Santa Ana wind season approaching, each of us needs to be prepared, and to have a plan for fires or any disaster that's likely to strike. Defensible space around homes is absolutely essential, especially for those living in the backcountry. Everyone should have a family disaster plan that includes where to meet, how to keep in touch, what to do with pets and livestock, as well as gathering supplies including food, water and medication – all this must all be planned in advance. Once disaster strikes, it's too late.
There are many agencies and programs that can help you prepare a disaster-response plan for your family --- here are just a few:
California's recent wildfires, and the earthquakes near the Salton Sea, should serve as a wakeup call for all of us. Now is the time to plan and prepare. The safety of our loved ones may depend on actions we take today.

There's often lots of controversy in Sacramento, but contrary to what may be a common impression, many bills pass with overwhelming support from both parties. This session was no different. For example, we passed AB 1710 (Wood) to allow pharmacists to administer FDA-approved COVID-19 Vaccines. We also passed AB 1577 (Burke) conforming state law to federal law to exclude CARES Act and Paycheck Protection Program loans from state income taxes. SB 1447 (Bradford) provides tax credits for small businesses that hire new employees, and in another effort to help workers and small businesses, we passed AB 1731 (Boerner Horvath) to ease the availability of the work sharing program so that workers can remain on the job. And SB 872 (Dodd) expands homeowners' insurance protections during states of emergencies.
Bills impacting animal welfare included SB 573 (Chang) which requires microchipping of shelter dogs and cats, along with AB 1974 (Gray & Chau) to help protect and advance the health, safety, welfare and aftercare of race horses.
We passed SB 803 (which I co-authored with Senator Jim Beall), to support a mental health peer specialist certification program for counties that wish to help workers dealing with mental health or substance abuse issues. Other bi-partisan bills included AB 2421 (Quirk) a bill to speed installation of stand-by generators for cell towers in hard-pressed rural areas, and AB 1138 (Gallagher), to require parental consent before an online user account can be created for a child.

The 2019-2020 legislative session ended on August 31. During this two-year period, 5,423 bills of all types were introduced. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we had two unexpected shutdowns, and in the last weeks some members were absent and Senators were forced to vote remotely. At one point, there was an unsuccessful attempt to limit Senate debate to save time. In a normal year, the fate of much important legislation is often decided during the final few days, but this year was even more hectic.
Even so, two of my bills passed right at the end. AB 1304 supports successful reentry for those returning home from prison by helping to break the cycle of substance use and recidivism, save lives and provide a significant return on investment. SB 855, a bill that I coauthored, updates California's 21-year old Mental Health Parity Act to increase access to treatment by requiring insurers to cover medically necessary services. Both bills passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.
Other legislation was directed at stimulating our ailing economy. An attempt to repeal AB 5 failed. This is the bill that limits independent contractors work. But two bills that modify its disastrous economic impact passed. One extends the sunset on exemptions for newspaper distributors and creates other preferences for local news organizations, and another attempts to fix some administrative issues and add additional exemptions. We also approved tax credits for small businesses that hire new employees. The legislation targets employers with less than 100 workers and that suffered a 50% loss of income during the pandemic. And finally, we've asked the Governor to call a special session to deal more thoroughly with the state's economic problems.
The shutdowns, COVID, and the ongoing economic crisis, and what's shaping up to be a severe wildfire season, will make 2020 a year we remember.

In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the board raised daily per diem payments 140 percent, from $25 to $60.
Supervisor Karen Spiegel was the principal advocate of changing the compensation formula, arguing that at $25 per day, ""jurors are basically donating their time.""
The modified payment structure takes effect on Oct. 15.
Spiegel said when she took office nearly two years ago, she met with members of the civil grand jury, and one of the chief complaints was inadequate per diem for the time given to tasks.
The last time the compensation formula was changed was in 1993, when jurors were receiving $15 per day for service, according to the county Executive Office.
A comparative study conducted by the Executive Office showed that Riverside County's existing payment structure was on par with San Diego County, where jurors receive $25 per day and are required to dedicate 32 hours a week to work.
However, in Los Angeles County, the per diem is $60 per day, as it is in San Bernardino County, where jurors are only required to meet Tuesday to Thursday, while in Orange County, the compensation is $50 per day, with a minimum 23-hour per week commitment, according to the study.
With the compensation hikes, the budget for the grand jury will increase from $400,000 to $580,708 in the current fiscal year.
Riverside County's 19-member civil grand jury is in session year- round, investigating complaints from the public about government agencies and conducting inquiries of its own.
The current jury was seated in June.
""This is an opportunity to say that if anybody's interested, we're always looking for residents to serve on the grand jury,"" Spiegel said.

Ballots returned through the U.S. Postal Service mail system in the pre-paid envelope provided with the ballot must be signed by the voter and postmarked on or before Nov. 3 — and received up to 17 days after the election.
Ballots can be placed in any one of the 80 ballot drop-off locations, including specific city halls, libraries and community centers. The drop-off locations are already accepting ballots throughout Riverside County. Find your drop-off location here.

Since joining the Legislature I have authored and supported many bills protecting pets and native wildlife, most of which are now law.
This session, I co-authored AB 128, which prevents the sale of wild horses for slaughter when purchased at auction. I also supported SB 469, which allows the California Horse Racing Board to quickly suspend events when necessary to protect the health and safety of horses or riders, along with AB 1565 to speed adoptions of kittens in animal shelters. SB 397 facilitates the evacuation of pet owners and their animals during emergencies. Unfortunately, SB 64 to reduce unnecessary euthanizing of shelter dogs and cats, was vetoed.
I authored legislation creating the Native California Wildlife Rehabilitation Voluntary Fund, allowing taxpayers to check off contributions on their tax returns to support injured or sick wildlife. This fund is now offering grants to rehab organizations! I co-authored a bill limiting mile-long gill nets for less destructive fishing techniques as well as legislation, known as the ""Beagle Bill"", requiring research institutions that use dogs or cats to offer those animals for adoption, and a bill protecting 'good Samaritans' who rescue trapped animals from hot cars. I supported legislation to ban cosmetics manufactured or developed using animal testing - the first in the nation!

Pastor Greg Laurie, 67, of Harvest Christian Fellowship tested positive after attending the Sept. 26 Prayer March on the National Mall with Vice President Mike Pence and evangelist Franklin Graham. That same day, Laurie attended a White House Rose Garden gala during which President Donald Trump officially unveiled Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett as his pick to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Sept. 18.
In a Facebook post that Laurie released Monday, he said he tested positive Friday. Laurie said he said his wife, Cathe, are in quarantine, and the rest of his family tested negative.
""My symptoms have been mild so far, and I expect to make a full recovery. I have always taken the Coronavirus seriously, and it has tragically taken many lives."" Laurie said in the post. ""At a time like this, we need to pray for those that have it and avoid politicizing it. If our President and First Lady can get COVID-19, clearly anyone can. I chose to first tell those I was directly in touch with and the congregation I pastor. Thank you for your concern and prayers. I hope to see you all soon.""
Photos and video taken at both Sept. 26 events show a majority of attendees unmasked, shaking hands, and not following social distancing guidelines — including Laurie. The events have been dubbed ""superspreaders"" of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
During the Sept. 26 Prayer March, Laurie delivered a sermon to the thousands of mostly unmasked attendees, asking them to join him in prayer to ""heal our land.""
As of Monday, several officials in the Trump administration — including the president — have tested positive for the virus.
Laurie serves as senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside; Harvest Corona in Corona; Harvest Woodcrest in Riverside; Harvest at Kumulani in Kapalua, Hawaii; and Harvest Orange County in Irvine. He lives in Newport Beach.
The Harvest church has not released any public statements about Laurie's positive test or his current medical condition. Additionally, the church did not immediately comment about Laurie's test result, nor was there any official word on contacts he's had with the Harvest congregation.
Laurie's ties to the Trump administration go back to 2017, when the president selected him to serve as one of several evangelical church leaders to participate in the National Prayer Service hosted at the Washington National Cathedral following the Presidential Inauguration."

I recently joined my legislative colleagues to recognize over 100 nonprofits that work tirelessly to enhance our communities and the lives of our citizens. Due to the pandemic, we were unable to have the usual ceremony at the Capitol, but the lack of a formal celebration cannot diminish the important contributions made by California's nonprofits.
This year I am very pleased to recognize the Assistance League of Inland North County as my Nonprofit of the Year. Serving communities from Fallbrook to Rancho Bernardo, and from Warner Springs to San Marcos, Assistance League's 150 members volunteer more than 26,000 hours annually to serve those in need. Programs include community outreach to address current community needs, such as providing 17 defibrillators to the Escondido Police Department, and ""Operation School Bell,"" to improve self-esteem and school attendance by providing new clothing and shoes to school children. ""Ready….Set….Read,"" provides one-on-one reading support and gifts of books for children, and ""Operation Duffel Bags"" assists foster teen graduates from the San Pasqual Academy. In addition, scholarships are provided for graduating seniors from San Pasqual and other local high schools. ""Project Seniors,"" aids seniors and homeless individuals, and ""Kids' Cozy Corner at Palomar Medical Center's emergency waiting area provides needed comfort to kids and families dealing with stressful emergencies. The League supports nine philanthropic programs benefitting children, adults and senior citizens alike.
The Assistance League, celebrating its 35th anniversary, is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit. Financed through donations and grants, the primary funding source is the Thrift and Consignment Shop located at 2068 E. Valley Pkwy, in Escondido.

""We are really excited to have patrons come back into the libraries,"" said County Librarian Barbara Howison. ""Our online resources and services have thrived through the pandemic, as well as popular programs such as virtual story times.

During the modified service, patrons can stay inside a library for up to one hour, and services are limited to borrowing and returning materials and accessing public computers.
Masks are required to enter the libraries.
Other COVID-19 safety measures include floor markers for social distancing, hand sanitizer stations, reduction in the number of available computers (for social distancing), partitions at counters, and the removal of all lounge furniture.
The libraries will resume normal business hours and will continue to offer digital and curbside service during this time.

""All election activities in Riverside County are open for public observation,"" Registrar Rebecca Spencer told City News Service. ""The main rule is that observers cannot interfere or interrupt the election process.""
During Tuesday's presidential debate, President Donald Trump repeated his unproven claims of widespread electoral fraud and urged his supporters to ""go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen.""
According to Spencer, people of any political stripe are permitted to stand outside or inside polling places in Riverside County, but she noted that individuals who request to be within a precinct station must observe social distancing, and because of that requirement, only a few people may be allowed inside.
""We ask that observers introduce themselves to the poll workers, and the poll workers will let them know what area of the room can be used for observation,"" the registrar said. ""The observers cannot touch any election material and cannot approach voters inside the polling place.""
The California Elections Code, specifically sections 18370 and 18371, prohibits ""electioneering"" activity within 100 feet of polling places. That includes asking voters who they support, circulating petitions or offering to assist a voter in marking his or her ballot.
In previous elections, civic advocacy groups have observed election activities in Riverside County, and in 2008, Save-R-Vote of Temecula Valley highlighted a number of deficiencies from the June primary that year. The group's president, the late Tom Courbat, a former county chief financial officer, revealed problems with securing ballots that were transferred from precincts to collection centers.
The findings led the Board of Supervisors to order an audit of the Office of the Registrar of Voters, which became the basis for operational modifications that were instituted in the ensuing years.
The county, however, continues to contend with some lingering issues, including the expeditious posting of results on election night. As an assemblyman in 2010, current board Chairman Manuel Perez was among signatories to a letter calling for changes to make the county's ballot processing apparatus work more efficiently.
According to Spencer, there will be at least 120 polling places available countywide, though the emphasis this year is on vote-by-mail ballots in deference to public health protocols.
There will be 80 vote-by-mail drop-off locations, including libraries, senior centers, municipal and county offices, that will be established over the next week."

""We are making sure not to spend more than what's allocated,"" Lisa Brandl told the board. ""Are we going to overspend our CARES Act allocation? No, we are not.""
The county has received roughly $450 million in CARES allotments, originating from the federal government and dispensed by the state. Another $37 million is expected to be disbursed to the county before the end of the year.
The first and largest installment, $431 million, was awarded in April. Since then, an additional $56.2 million has been assigned, according to Brandl.
In a previous board meeting, the supervisors asked Brandl for specifics on expenditures that they did not feel were adequately addressed in her first CARES Act presentation, and Brandl returned with clear references, not laden with charts and graphs.
By far, the county's largest expenditures have been for Riverside University Health System staffing, including a six-month round-the-clock activation of the Emergency Operations Center that has since ended, as well as procurement of personal protective equipment, the establishment of COVID-19 screening sites and mobile labs.
According to Brandl, $322.7 million in actual or committed expenses fall into this category.
The Small Business Assistance Grant Program required a $50 million commitment, three-quarters of which has been spent. The board established the program in June to provide individual relief grants of up to $10,000 per qualifying business that has been impacted by the public health orders tied to virus containment.
The program is in its final phase. However, if funding is made available for additional distributions, the county will announce it before Dec. 31. More information is available at www.RivcoBizHelp.org.
Brandl said about $34 million has or will be expended for the county's program to address virus impacts on ""congregate facilities,"" including assisted living and nursing homes, rehabs and jails.
The board in June established the Riverside County Rental Relief Fund, under which qualifying renters can receive up to $3,500 in CARES money to pay their lease obligations, if they're unable to meet them because of being thrown out of work by the public health lockdowns or similar difficulties.
The board set aside $30 million, and to date, 2,318 households countywide have received checks, totaling $7.6 million. Because the utilization rate isn't what the supervisors expected, they voted Tuesday to take $8.36 million out of the original allotment and re-allocate it to homeless relief programs. Information on applying for rental assistance can be found at www.UnitedLift.org.
Other CARES Act distributions include $10 million for a Nonprofit Assistance Fund that makes grants of up to $10,000 available to individual qualifying not-for-profit organizations; $10 million for the Office of Education's ""All for One"" program that is providing thousands of laptops and tablets to students who are in distance learning programs because of school closures; and $4 million for the Pathways to Employment Program, which provides job training and placement assistance to low-income residents struggling because of the lockdowns.
Details on the latter program, including how to gain admittance, can be obtained by calling 951-955-1161.
Brandl acknowledged that the county's commitments have swollen beyond the CARES Act funding that's currently available — by about $60 million. But according to her presentation, that gap will be covered using grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the California Office of Emergency Services."

This session, I am honored to be recognized as a ""Mental Health Super Hero"" by the Steinberg Institute, because of my work on mental health policy, advancing mental health parity to physical health and working to expand access to care. In addition I supported 9 bi-partisan bills, which were all forwarded to the Governor for his signature.
I co-authored three of these bills, signed by the Governor on September 25th. Senate Bill 855 (Wiener) expands Californians' ability to obtain treatment for substance abuse and mental health disorders by requiring insurers to pay for medically necessary treatments on parity with physical health. SB 803 (Beall) creates a certification process for peer support specialists to help persons going through mental health challenges, and AB 2112 (Ramos), supports regional and local efforts to address suicide prevention.
I also joined a bi-partisan majority to support legislation requiring board-and-care homes serving those with severe mental illness to notify counties of any planned closures. Other legislation requires insurers to provide psychiatric consultation to primary care physicians providing mental health care for children and mothers. Laura's Law, authorizing court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment for mentally ill individuals in participating counties will now become permanent and all counties will be required to participate, unless they formally opt out.
The growing problem of homelessness, heavily impacted by substance abuse and mental illness, will be addressed through creation of a new cabinet position to coordinate and consolidate programs throughout the state. Legislation expanding the ability of Nurse Practitioners to treat patients, including the mentally ill, along with a bill creating a grant program expanding community-based responses to crisis situations, frequently caused by mentally ill individuals, all now await the Governor's signature.
Should each of these bills become law, the result will be some of the most significant changes to California's mental health policies in decades.

Judge John M. Monterosso was selected by fellow jurists countywide to serve a two-year term. He will be replacing Presiding Judge John W. Vineyard, whose term expires on Dec. 31.
Monterosso is currently the assisting presiding judge and serves as the lead jurist overseeing administrative affairs at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta, where he has been assigned since his appointment to the bench by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2007.
Monterosso hears both criminal and civil matters and has presided over a number of trials.
He was a supervising district attorney before receiving his judicial appointment. His term will run until the end of 2022.
The assistant presiding judge in the new term will be Judge Judith C. Clark, who currently presides over the Juvenile Dependency Court.
Vineyard's term started in January 2019, and for most of the current year, he has been immersed in reconfiguring court operations stemming from the coronavirus public health orders. On his watch, all criminal and civil trials were suspended but have since re-commenced.

According to the county Executive Office, the governor's office informed local officials on Monday the ""Homekey"" money would be allocated to two projects in the eastern county region, and one in Riverside.
The first project involves utilizing the Ivy Palms lodge in Palm Springs for transitional housing, another entails expanding and improving the Mountain View Estates Mobile Home Park in Oasis for migrant farmworkers and their families, and the final one is to secure a 52-bed dormitory in Riverside for LGBTQ youth infected with HIV/AIDS.
""These new housing units will provide essential housing to some of our most disadvantaged residents,"" Supervisor Karen Spiegel said. ""Housing is essential to creating healthier, safer and more secure communities, and the county continues to find ways to provide that essential housing to people struggling with homelessness.""
Homekey is administered by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, which announced earlier this month that Lake Elsinore had been granted $3.14 million to cover the cost of procuring and renovating an abandoned hotel to establish 14 transitional housing units that can provide accommodations for a maximum 28 individuals.
Officials said the goal is to end the municipality's chronic homelessness within the next two years.
Homekey was rolled out in July, with $600 million set aside under the 2020-21 fiscal year budget. Roughly 90 percent of the money originated from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief & Economic Security Act distribution to the state, according to the governor's office."

For Banning voters, Measure ""L"" will impose a gross receipts tax capped at 10 percent on marijuana distribution outlets.

Other key initiatives outside of Banning-Beaumont include:
In Menifee, Measure ""M"" would repeal Measure ""DD,"" which resulted in a 1% sales tax on all transactions within the city to support public safety. DD was approved in 2016, and it led to the overall sales tax rate going from 7.75 percent to 8.75 percent. A group of residents initiated a petition drive to undo the tax increase, but supporters of the tax say eliminating it will mean a future loss of $11 million in revenue.
Supporters of M counter that the city is receiving state funding for public safety programs that will offset the loss.
In Riverside, Measure ""R"" calls for realigning elections to consistently coincide with state primaries. However, the proposal also would add an extra year — for a total of five — on the terms of council members in wards 2, 4 and 6, beginning in 2021. The normal term is four years, and the extra year would only apply from 2021 to 2026, reverting after that to four years.
The temporary exception is necessary to make the election cycle for each member occur in an even year, according to the city.
In Jurupa Valley, Measure ""U"" would replace a measure approved in 2018 permitting cannabis stores. Under the replacement proposal, the number of outlets would be capped at nine, a net increase of two compared to the current municipal code. However, Measure U would mandate that operators be required to obtain both conditional use and regulatory permits, though only the latter are required now.
The proposal would also impose a gross receipts tax of 6 percent on cannabis retailers, 2 percent on distributors and 2.5 percent on manufacturing facilities.
In San Jacinto, the City Council is seeking voters' approval of Measure ""V,"" which would increase local sales taxes by 1 percent on all transactions. According to supporters, the estimated $3.2 million in annual revenue generated from the imposition would go to public safety programs, water infrastructure improvements and road repairs. There was no listed opposition.
The Corona City Council is similarly seeking voters' OK on Measure ""X,"" a 1-cent sales tax increment in support of public safety and 911 services. The addition would raise roughly $30 million annually, according to supporters.
Corona taxpayer advocate Joe Morgan wrote in campaign literature that the hike would mostly bolster existing public safety personnel's salaries.
""We have hired new dispatchers and officers, purchased entire fleets of new vehicles and several new pieces of fire equipment in the last two years, all the while growing our cash reserves,"" Morgan said. ""Measure X is nothing but an attempt to loosen the purse strings and grow the paychecks of the highest paid employees in the city.""
Backers of the measure wrote that ""California has taken tens of millions of dollars from Corona, forcing years of budget cuts"" that have put the city at risk of not being able to handle medical, fire and police calls in a timely way.
Under Corona's Measure ""Y,"" any person elected to the City Council would be limited to three terms — for life — regardless of whether the terms are consecutive or served at different intervals.
Lake Elsinore's Measure ""Z"" is analogous to V and X, seeking a 1 percent sales tax hike for public safety, as well as homeless relief programs and infrastructure repairs. It would net an estimated $10 million annually, according to the city.
All of the above measures require only a simple majority to pass.

""Law enforcement was contacted to ensure that access to the parking lot and voter assistance center were clear,"" Brooke Federico, a spokeswoman for Riverside County, said in an email to the Los Angeles Times. ""The Sheriff's Department responded and cleared access to the parking lot and voter assistance center.""
The winding caravan of pickup trucks and other vehicles adorned with pro-Trump signs and U.S. flags began at a Riverside restaurant and drove west along the 91 Freeway and then south on the 15 Freeway. They had been organized under a Twitter hashtag associated with similar events in other states.
The destination was the Ronald Reagan Sports Park in Temecula, a sprawling municipal community center with soccer fields and a skate park -- but also a voting location at the adjacent Temecula Community Recreation Center building. An estimated 4,000 people crowded the larger park about 2 p.m. in a peaceful, if boisterous, rally, officials said, according to The Times.
Capt. Zach Hall of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said his deputies made no arrests but did field a few telephone complaints from voters who said the partisan signs, shirts and other materials potentially violated the 100-foot electioneering rule in state law. The deputies talked to poll workers who said the Trump supporters largely kept their distance from voters.
Deputies also had to scramble to unwind a massive traffic jam in an area where officials weren't prepared for so many vehicles at once, according to The Times.
""They kind of caught us off guard,"" said Hall, who heads the department's Temecula station. ""We had a lot of traffic issues. The infrastructure there is not really designed for that kind of traffic."""

But you still can cast or hand off your ballot in person this year — and you can do it early or on Election Day.
Dubbed ""vote centers"" rather than ""polling places,"" physical voting locations will also be a bit different than in years past.
The amount of in-person polling places in California will be limited compared to previous elections, in accordance with a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in August, but some vote centers already opened as early as Oct. 24.
Centers are required to remain open Saturday through Monday, Nov. 2, for at least eight hours each day and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Although every registered and active voter in California was already mailed a ballot in October, polling places will be open for same-day voter registration, for those who need assistance with language or disabilities — or for those who simply want to witness the historic, Election Day unfold.

The Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, Mountain Lion Foundation and the Endangered Habitats League signed the accord with Ambient Communities LLC and Temecula after two years of legal challenges over the 270-acre Altair Development near Business Park Drive and Diaz Road.
The agreement specifies that a 55-acre swath of land known as the ""South Parcel"" will be set aside for the fast-disappearing Santa Ana mountain lions to traverse.
The 200-acre Altair project called for a mixed-use development and a multi-lane highway in the open space hills above Old Town Temecula. Part of the development was situated on the South Parcel — the only passage left for wildlife to move between coastal and inland mountains through the Santa Margarita River, Temecula Creek and the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve, which are adjacent to the project.
""This agreement gives Santa Ana's imperiled mountain lions a pathway to recovery,"" Center for Biological Diversity attorney J.P. Rose said. ""Poorly planned highways and development have hemmed this population in, and these beautiful big cats are being driven toward extinction. Now they have a better chance at survival.""
In 2018, the conservation groups sued the city over approval of an environmental impact report that they alleged failed to consider the impacts on mountain lions if the entire Altair project went forward without modifications.
The South Parcel fronts the Cleveland National Forest to the west and would also promote protection of western pond turtles and other fragmented wildlife, according to the CBD.
Riverside County Superior Court Judge Daniel Ottolia in March sided with the plaintiffs, finding flaws in the EIR, culminating in the parcel preservation agreement.
""We thank the city of Temecula and Ambient in helping us keep the parcels next to the headwaters of the Santa Margarita River intact, thus avoiding an impact that would have almost certainly ensured the extinction of the Santa Ana lions,"" Sierra Club spokeswoman Palm Nelson said. ""Their fragile status indicates the health of all the species in our region. This agreement will give these magnificent creatures and struggling wildlife a chance.""
Under the compact, the parcel will not only be preserved and re-forested, but the city of Temecula will hire a ranger to monitor the space to ensure it is not disturbed.
""This agreement marks an important step in the fight to protect the Santa Ana mountain lions, and we look forward to collaborating on future efforts to plan and fund the restoration of corridors for these big cats,"" Cougar Connection spokeswoman Vicki Long said.
According to the conservation groups, the California Fish & Game Commission is now considering adding Santa Ana mountain lions and other cougar populations elsewhere to the state's Endangered Species Act.
As few as 20 adult Santa Ana mountain lions survive, and they suffer from severe genetic restriction because overdevelopment already curtails their movements, according to the Center for Biological Diversity."

The uptick comes as Riverside County Supervisor Karen Spiegel will ask her colleagues Tuesday to support a proposal for the Executive Office to coordinate with neighboring counties in presenting a unified request to the governor to revise or drop the state's current color-coded coronavirus tier system.
The total number of COVID-19 infections recorded in Riverside County since the public health documentation period began in early March stands at 66,732 Monday, an increase of 975 people since Friday's reporting, according to RUHS.
The number of deaths linked to COVID-19 was reported at 1,295 Monday, and increase of 16 people since Friday, the data showed.
The number of COVID-positive hospitalizations totaled 164 Monday, compared to 161 on Friday. Monday's figure includes 60 ICU patients — 21 more than Friday, according to RUHS.
As numbers continue rising, Spiegel's proposal amounts to a directive for retiring CEO George Johnson, or incoming Interim CEO Juan Perez, and Executive Office staff to ""engage"" Imperial, Orange, San Bernardino, San Diego and possibly other Southern California counties in forming a partnership focused on addressing defects in the state's coronavirus tier structure.
Riverside County was bumped back to the purple tier Tuesday due an increased coronavirus case rate and not meeting state thresholds for testing.
""Riverside County has created or expanded 22 programs to mitigate direct and indirect impacts (of COVID-19),"" Spiegel said in documents posted to the Board of Supervisors' agenda for Tuesday. ""Yet there is no number of programs that can replace someone's livelihood or business ... Entire industries are at a standstill, and public assistance is limited.""
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the color-coded system in August to replace the multi-phase public health de-regulation strategy originally established at the end of April.
The tier plan has four color bands — purple, red, orange and yellow — that reflect how a county is managing coronavirus impacts. Riverside County had moved into the ""red"" tier in the third week of September, removing barriers for some businesses and houses of worship to resume indoor operations with capacity limitations.
With Riverside County now back in the state's most restrictive ""purple"" tier, many indoor services and functions are prohibited.
""Riverside County continues to make great strides in improving testing, as well as outreach within hard-to-reach groups and high spread workplaces,"" Spiegel said. ""Hospital capacity also remains very stable and has been for months.""
The supervisor was the foremost critic of the CDPH's reclassification, remarking immediately after the board was informed of the change that ""enough is enough. We've got to find a way to step forward without hurting people. My frustration has turned to anger. We are way too far beyond this.""
In her call for a united front to challenge the color-coded categorizations, Spiegel said ""our residents and businesses feel the devastating impacts that this new round of closures will have on their livelihoods, mental health and other vital ... needs.""
According to the supervisor, all counties should be entitled to a ""consistent, predictable and reasonably achievable structure in order to reopen our economy and society in a safe way.""
She emphasized that certain metrics, including hospital capacity, should be restored as main criteria for reopening. The county's COVID-positive hospitalizations are now at or below levels reported in April. The peak was in mid-July.
""Presenting a coordinated, unified platform to the state will strengthen our voice and make sure the concerns of Riverside County are heard in Sacramento,"" Spiegel said.
The board approved a self-directed reopening plan on Oct. 6, but the timetable originally included in the plan for allowing businesses to fully open was removed on a 4-1 vote because it would have conflicted with state mandates.
Johnson was authorized to implement reopening policies outside of the state's schedule, but he said more than $100 million in relief grants from the state would be at risk if the county moved independently.

Throughout my term in the legislature I have advocated for those most vulnerable.
I authored a bill to safeguard children who witness domestic violence incidents, and to allow counties to provide court approved mental health treatments for persons who have completed their sentences if they are a danger to themselves or others. I have introduced legislation to increase penalties for those convicted of child pornography-related offenses when those crimes take place on government owned computers Other co-authored legislation requires background checks for adults in youth sports, increased liability insurance for senior care facilities, and a requirement to post citation notices at child-care facilities, all of which are now law.
My affordable quality health care is critical. For example, I co-authored a bill that provides Medication-Assisted substance use Treatment for eligible parolees to reduce crime and recidivism. Other co-authored bills create peer support specialists to help persons going through mental health challenges, and another bill that supports regional and local efforts to address suicide prevention. These bills have also been signed into law. Unfortunately, legislation I introduced to require health plans and insurers to cover screening, genetic counseling and testing for (BRCA) breast cancer susceptibility gene mutations was vetoed.
Access to care is another huge concern. Millions were added to the state's Medi-Cal program over the past few years, even though funding for Medi-Cal providers was significantly cut. Some of those cuts were restored in a piecemeal fashion, but funding for providers is still inadequate and access to care in California's rural and underserved areas remains problematic. Obviously, access to care is critical now that we're in a pandemic.
Much more needs to be done, and I'm looking forward to tackling these important issues next year.

74,/california/temecula/how-would-prop-15-impact-riverside-county,2020-10-21T01:13:09Z,How Would Prop. 15 Impact Riverside County?,0,17,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — There's a lot of rhetoric surrounding PropositIon 15 on the November ballot. If passed, the statewide ""split roll"" initiative promises to raise billions in tax revenue that will go to school districts, cities and counties at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is hurting budgets.
But what does Prop. 15 mean to Riverside County? How many local properties would be impacted and how much money do local jurisdictions and school districts stand to gain if the initiative passes?
That's what we set out to answer.
First, just what does Prop. 15 do? It requires that commercial properties be reassessed at market value at least every three years — something that hasn't been happening unless a property is sold or improved. The tax of 1 percent of value, with 2 percent annual increases, would still apply.
There would be no change in Prop. 13's rules for residential properties. It only impacts commercial and industrial property owners.
Agricultural land, and owners whose commercial and industrial properties are worth less than $3 million total, would be exempt under Prop. 15.
Generally speaking, Prop. 15 proponents contend the initiative closes an unintended tax loophole that some commercial and industrial property owners have enjoyed because their properties have not been reassessed for decades. Opponents say it will end up hurting businesses struggling to survive.
In Riverside County, there are a total of 36,941 commercial and industrial properties, according to an analysis of Prop. 15 from the office of the Riverside County Assessor-Clerk-Recorder. The 10-page document shows that about one-third of these properties would need to be assessed annually if Prop. 15 passes. Initially, this would bring an additional $136 million in property tax revenue to Riverside County.
But, once the initiative was fully phased in (in about three years), with ongoing reassessments across all applicable commercial and industrial properties, the county would see $407 million in additional revenue, according to the county analysis.
Under Prop. 15, the added tax revenue projected in Riverside County after the phase-in would be doled out this way: $200 million for cities and special districts; about $163 million for local school districts and community colleges; and approximately $44 million to the county, according to the county assessor analysis.
Not all of this money would come to Riverside County. Of the total collected, about 60 percent would stay local; the rest would go to the state.
Also, there would be costs incurred to collect the taxes, according to the county analysis. Annual costs at the Riverside County assessor's office would ""increase significantly due to market-based reassessments of all commercial and industrial properties. The number of appeals per year is estimated to dramatically rise as well,"" according to the analysis, which estimates a one-time cost of $1.1 million with increasing costs of up to $9.4 million annually.
The county analysis does not form an opinion on Prop. 15, but rather it is a document that lets the reader make the decision.
""The split roll initiative would impact the majority of commercial properties, providing tax exemptions for the following: the first $500,000 of a business's personal property or 100 percent of a business's personal property when the business has 50 or less full-time employees,"" the document summarizes. ""Additionally, properties of businesses whose holdings in the state are valued at less than $3 million will be taxed based on their purchase price instead of market value. The split roll system would be phased-in over three years. Each property would thereafter be reassessed every three years."""

One of the most important lessons from the pandemic is the need to prioritize reliable prescription drug manufacturing. California, especially this region, has long been a center for medical research, and one of our top priorities should be to encourage more drug research, innovations, and manufacturing, especially for generic drugs. That's why I support Senate Bill 852.
While the main benefit of SB 852 will be to make medication available for thousands of Californians at a more reasonable cost, as we emerge from the pandemic-induced recession we can also create thousands of new jobs to help restore the world's fifth-largest economy.
SB 852 requires the California Health and Human Services Agency (CHHSA) to enter into partnerships with drug manufacturers and other agencies to provide medication, including insulin, at lower costs. As we all know, the high cost of prescription drugs is one of the drivers of rising health care premiums – and lowering these costs should be a top priority.
SB 852 will encourage production of generic, lower cost prescription drugs. The bill prioritizes drugs that have the greatest impact on drug pricing, to increase competition among manufacturers and help address market shortages, with high-cost drugs for chronic conditions prioritized. Chronic conditions have long been a high cost driver in the healthcare industry and I have worked hard to gain recognition for the barriers and battles that chronic care patients have had to endure to attain access to critical treatments. Reports on data and accountability will be due to the Legislature over the next three years on the program's success in reducing costs and improving public access to the targeted drugs.
This type of public/private partnership for drug manufacturing is not new. California has been manufacturing the only treatment for infant botulism since 2003, and the states of Massachusetts and Michigan have been teaming up with private drug manufacturers for many years.
SB 852 was signed into law on September 28th. More jobs, lower drug costs and improved public health are on the way.

November 28 is 'Small Business Saturday,' a day to patronize local small businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Without them, our state and national economies will never recover.
My husband and I have owned our own small business for over 25 years, I know how hard it is to keep a business going in California. Costly, overbearing regulations, high taxes and fees, high rents, energy bills, all make doing business in this state a challenge. Now the pandemic has struck, with a disproportionate impact on small businesses throughout the state. Many have been forced to close or significantly curtail operations while their larger (essential) competitors often remain open. Many small businesses are just one more shut-down away from closing their doors permanently. We, their customers, should do all we can to make sure they remain open, for their sake and ours.
Our local small businesses make up 95% of the businesses in this region. They employ our family, friends and neighbors. The continuously changing orders to open, close, partially open and close again are wreaking havoc. Many of our favorite restaurants, shops, stores and other businesses will never open their doors again.
Small Business Saturday is an important reminder that small businesses are part of the very fabric of this region. They employ thousands, and give back so much to our communities. So on Small Business Saturday, make a purchase from a local vendor, and continue to support them over the holidays and throughout the year. Without them, the current pandemic-induced recession may become permanent and develop into a depression – that must not happen!
The Legislature goes back into session in January. I'll be doing everything I can to ensure that California's small businesses are allowed to operate safely and profitably -- just like their larger competitors.

Under California's Unclaimed Property Law, banks, insurance companies and other businesses are required to transfer property to the Controller's office if it goes unclaimed over a specified period of time, usually three years. Bank accounts, stocks, bonds, uncashed checks, insurance benefits, wages, and the contents of safe deposit boxes are common types of unclaimed property. Funds are held for as long as it takes to reunite the property with its rightful owner, so the pot keeps growing simply because many do not search for the property they may have coming.
Checking to see if you have unclaimed funds is easy. Visit the State's Controller's unclaimed property website (claimit.ca.gov) and simply type in your name and see if you are listed. If it looks like you have some funds coming to you, you can file a claim immediately if the value is less than $5,000. Higher amounts require you to mail a form and takes longer to process. Also, please remember that there is no charge to retrieve your property from the State Controller – so watch out for scams that try to charge for this free service.
Thousands of people have received their unclaimed properties over the ears, valued at over $23 million. You could have been one of them. So don't let the state keep funds that may rightfully belong to you., – visit the Controller's website today at claimit.ca.gov, or call (800) 992-4647.

78,/california/temecula/trump-poised-lose-riverside-county-temecula-leaders-emerge,2020-11-17T19:46:16Z,Trump Poised To Lose Riverside County; Temecula...,0,5,Toni McAllister,Patch Staff,"TEMECULA, CA — While thousands of ballots remain to be processed in Riverside County, it's two weeks post-Nov. 3 Election and most races in Temecula have very clear leaders.
As of Tuesday morning, approximately 45,000 timely postmarked vote-by-mail ballots and 25,000 provisional ballots remain to be processed in the county. Additionally, under state law the Riverside County Registrar of Voters must continue to accept timely postmarked ballots through Friday.
While outstanding ballots remain, in Riverside County Joe Biden (D) leads Republican President Donald Trump by nearly 77,000 votes. The current tally is 493,368 ballots cast for Biden and 416,515 for Trump.
If the lead holds, Biden may win the 2020 contest by a greater margin than Hillary Clinton (D) did four years ago. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump by just over 60,000 votes. Clinton garnered 373,695 ballots cast or 50.11 percent from county voters compared to 333,243 or 44.68 percent for Trump.
Aside from national politics, key races in Temecula included Assembly District 75, Congressional Districts 42 and 50, city council seats and Temecula Valley Unified School District trustee seats. Here's how those races stand as of Tuesday.
In Trustee Area 1, Fire Department Captain Steve Loner remains well ahead in the race with 5,676 votes. Fellow challenger Robert Bryant Jr., a youth program director, has garnered 3,621 votes. Both men are hoping to unseat incumbent Lee Darling, who lags well behind with 1,255 votes.
In Trustee Area 5, Steven Schwartz is leading the race with 4,632 votes. Brooklynn McClure has garnered 4,362 votes, while Enrique Perez has 4,238. Mark Katan is trailing the three front runners with just 902 votes. Trustee Area 5 incumbent Kristi Rutz-Robbins was not on the ballot.
Perez is a business executive/parent, Schwartz a retired teacher, McClure a parent, and Katan an executive director, according to their candidate filings.
In District 2, Jessica Alexander is well ahead of Andy Black and Alisha Wilkins.
In District 4, voters are filling the seat left open in June when then-Mayor James ""Stew"" Stewart resigned after a controversial text he sent spurred allegations of racism. Stewart was on the 2020 ballot and is well ahead in the race by nearly 1,200 votes and appears poised to claim the seat over other District 4 candidates Mark Gular, Sonia Perez and Adam Ruiz.
In Riverside County, incumbent Marie Waldren (R) leads Democratic challenger Karen ""Kate"" Schwartz in Riverside County by nearly 10,000 votes.
The Associated Press has called this race for incumbent Ken Calvert (R), who currently leads Democratic challenger William ""Liam"" O'Mara by nearly 50,000 votes.
The Associated Press has called this race for Darrell Issa (R). In Riverside County, Issa leads Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar by nearly 4,000 votes.

The Legislature will open on December 7th with the swearing in of all members and start the 2021-2022 session. Though a few bills are likely to introduced, the day is largely ceremonial, and the new session will begin in earnest on January 6th.
Next year my priorities will continue to be on the needs of this region. We must ensure that we have sufficient resources and response to disasters like COVID and prevention of wildfires, that we have a secure, reliable water supply for people and agriculture alike, that our education system is funded with operational certainty for students and parents, that people can access health care easier, and that our increasingly overcrowded highways are modernized and upgraded.
The pandemic's economic fallout has been catastrophic for thousands of people and for California's overall economy. With businesses closing and thousands losing their jobs it is critical the state fixes the EDD, DMV and other failures. With that in mind, I will support policies that help small businesses and job creation to get the economy moving again. Needless to say, a faltering economy results in fewer tax dollars. Meeting the responsibilities of government will be extremely challenging with the tight state budget. But we must take a close look at our priorities to put necessities above desires.
In Sacramento, we may disagree on many issues, but there is much we agree on. Healthcare, education, wildfires, water and power infrastructure, and our economic distress – none of these is political which creates the need for bi-partisan solutions.
As the new session begins, I will continue to work with my colleagues from both parties as we tackle the enormous challenges facing California. I am humbled by the support I received from the district November 3rd, and I look forward to continuing to serve you in Sacramento.

80,/california/temecula/hemp-regulations-approved-riverside-county,2020-11-11T20:44:37Z,Hemp Regulations Approved In Riverside County,0,1,City News Service,News Partner,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — The Board of Supervisors Tuesday unanimously approved a series of regulations on where and how hemp growers can operate in unincorporated areas of Riverside County, prohibiting grows where water availability is already a challenge.
""We cannot allow groundwater basins to be depleted under any circumstance,"" Supervisor Kevin Jeffries said. ""That would be devastating to a community.""
The Industrial Hemp Cultivation & Manufacturing Ordinance was passed following a 90-minute hearing in which water, property setbacks and whether current growers should be ""grandfathered"" in to the regulatory scheme were all debated.
""This affects everyone in the county,"" said Nuevo resident Claude Trout. ""Think about everyone in the county, not just the few entrepreneurs who will be coming in to cultivate. This isn't for the majority of residents.""
Other speakers said the ordinance was long overdue and had been amended enough times in the last year to make it fair.
""These are agricultural products, and they contribute greatly to the diminishing private sector,"" said Supervisor Jeff Hewitt. ""You can't make everybody happy every time.""
The ordinance expressly prohibits hemp cultivation — indoor or outdoor — in large swaths of the Santa Margarita River Watershed, extending roughly from De Luz, just west of Temecula, east to Anza, south to the San Diego County line and north to Diamond Valley Lake near Hemet.
The space encompasses parts of the Eastern Municipal and Western Municipal water districts, as well as all of the Rancho California Water District. However, there are several pockets carved out and authorized for cultivation, as long as permit applicants have ready access to a well or can obtain a ""will serve"" letter from a water supplier guaranteeing that they will receive sufficient flow to sustain their grow.
Growers who obtained permits from the county previously and are located in a restricted area, such as Sage, received a two-year waiver from the Board of Supervisors to continue with their operation.
Similar ""grandfather"" clauses will be applied to other growers who have established operations. The Transportation & Land Management Agency said there are about 125 with permits, but it was uncertain how many are actively engaged in cultivating and maintaining crops.
Under the new ordinance, registration and licensing will continue through TLMA with the following requirements:
-- indoor and outdoor hemp cultivation must be a minimum of 1,000 feet from all schools, daycare centers, public parks and youth centers;
-- all grows must be a minimum of 300 feet from any property in a residentially zoned location;
-- all indoor cultivation sites must rely on 20% renewable energy for production;
-- all sites must have water conservation and recapturing mechanisms to ""minimize use of water where feasible""; and
-- all sites must receive prior scrutiny by their local water agency to show that they do not pose a risk of excess or wasteful water consumption.
The size of grows could be anywhere from five to over 160 acres, depending on where they're situated.
The main difference between hemp and unadulterated marijuana is the tetrahydrocannabinol -- or THC -- content. Hemp leaves have about three-tenths of 1 percent of the compounds contained in cannabis leaves, according to the Office of County Counsel.
Advocates of hemp production and research say its properties have proven benefits in treating some skin and heart disorders. It's also used in clothing and other commercial applications.
Unlike cannabis, hemp is not federally designated as a controlled substance, and production is permitted on Native American lands, under the supervision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The Santa Rosa Band of Cahuilla Indians began permitting hemp grows near Mountain Center in January.
The ordinance mandates limitations on hours of operation to reduce noise, and hemp production will not be permitted to be co-located with cannabis grows. However, to date, the board has not authorized one commercial marijuana farm in an unincorporated area."
81,/california/temecula/riverside-county-sidesteps-state-campaign-contributions-cap,2020-11-11T00:00:41Z,Riverside County Sidesteps State On Campaign...,0,1,City News Service,News Partner,"RIVERSIDE COUNTY, CA — The Board of Supervisors Tuesday tentatively approved caps on campaign contributions to local candidates in any Riverside County election, generally limiting individual offerings to $20,000 per election.
In a 5-0 vote without comment, the board gave its initial nod to Ordinance No. 963, following revisions that were applied by the Office of County Counsel following a hearing on the proposal last week. A vote to formally adopt the ordinance is scheduled Nov. 17.
Supervisor Kevin Jeffries, joined by Supervisor Chuck Washington, first introduced the proposal in August, and in the last three months, the Office of County Counsel worked to fine-tune it.
Supervisor Karen Spiegel, as well as Jeffries, expressed concern after reviewing the proposal on Nov. 3 and discovering a loophole that would have potentially permitted a candidate to take an unlimited amount of cash from a committee connected to a separate election and deposit the funds in a new committee account for a county-level election.
The provision was revised by county attorneys. Now inter-committee transfers will be limited to $20,000 — the same cap that applies to individual contributions.
Ordinance No. 963 sets contribution parameters only for candidates seeking election to assessor-clerk recorder, auditor-controller, county supervisor, district attorney, sheriff and treasurer-tax collector. The limits do not apply to state, federal or even municipal elections.
""The Board of Supervisors finds it necessary to adopt campaign limits for county elective offices so as to provide greater transparency ... and to allow everyone the right to participate and support the candidates of their choice without any one person or entity having undue influence in a county election,"" according to a statement attached to the ordinance.
The $20,000 cap will apply to all individual contributions in a general, primary, recall or other election cycle. However, exemptions will be permitted for candidates who contribute to their own campaign.
For instance, the ordinance permits a candidate to self-loan up to $100,000 per election, but in doing so, the loan recipient's opponent would be entitled to accept an equal amount in funding to ensure parity, according to the proposal.
Post-election contributions, of any size, will also be allowed — but only to the extent necessary to amortize the ""net debts outstanding from the election.""
The measure has a built-in inflation adjuster, beginning in 2023. From that time forward, in every odd-numbered year, the campaign contribution cap will automatically be raised 3 percent. So instead of $20,000, in 2023, the new limit will be $20,600.
The pending ordinance further specifies that all individual contributions in excess of $1,000 be subject to instant documentation and presentation on the Office of the Registrar of Voters' portal for transparency, adhering to the California Political Reform Act of 1974.
So-called ""independent"" expenditures by outside organizations in support of a candidate will not be impacted or controlled by the ordinance. Political action committees, unions, corporations and similar large organized donor groups generating and paying for their own advertisements and promotions are shielded from contribution limits under the U.S. Supreme Court case Citizens United v FEC, which was decided in 2010 based on free speech grounds.
Jeffries saw the need for a campaign contribution ordinance in response to Assembly Bill 571, which was signed into law by the governor in October 2019 and takes effect on Jan. 1, 2021.
Under the law, counties and cities that do not have campaign contribution limits on their books by that date will be required to operate under the default standards set by the state.
Under the state benchmark, the maximum individual contribution for a local candidate is $4,700 — the same individual limit that currently applies to candidates for state Assembly and Senate.
The county ordinance, after formal adoption, will take effect on Jan. 1."

This has been a tough year for all of us. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in business shutdowns, growing unemployment and extreme economic distress, along with related public health/mental health impacts for thousands. And now, the drawn-out election aftermath and the fast approaching holiday season will be adding to what's already been one of the most stressful years in decades. Stress and anxiety levels are going through the roof.
We all cope with stress differently, but there are generally agreed upon methods we all can use to keep stress in check. Among these are limiting the amount of time we spend listening to news sources, maintaining supporting relationships with friends and family, eating right, avoiding excessive food and alcohol, and getting plenty of exercise, if we're able. If stress or anxiety is interfering with daily life, contacting care providers may help. In addition, there are many resources available to help people cope.
I'm listing just a few below:
For First Responders:
For older Californians
For a more complete list of resources available, please visit: https://covid19.ca.gov/resources-for-emotional-support-and-well-being/
Taking care of mental health is just as important as taking care of physical health. I hope these resources are helpful for you and your loved ones.

California's small businesses employ over 7 million people, and make up 95% of all businesses in this region. Most employ less than 100 workers, and businesses with 4 employees or less comprise 65% of the total, like our neighborhood grocery or restaurant. The problems I encountered running my small retail business are what first led me to run for public office.
Before the pandemic, business in California was booming. Now small businesses are suffering. Many have shut down, completely or partially, and thousands of workers have lost their jobs.
This session the Legislature adopted measures aimed at supporting businesses and helping workers keep their jobs. For example, I was proud to support SB 1447, which provides tax credits for businesses that hire new employees. But we need to do more. Going forward, we must look at unnecessary rules and regulations that don't impact health and safety. We should consider ways to shield businesses from lawsuits over COVID-19 exposure, and provide a sales tax holiday so that businesses can lure back customers. The last thing we should be considering is increasing taxes on small businesses as they struggle to stay afloat.
Since joining the legislature, I have consistently supported repeal of unnecessary, burdensome regulations and opposed tax increases that would negatively impact business formation, worker retention and job growth. That's one reason the National Federation of Independent Businesses recognized me as a ""Guardian of Small Business"" last year.
The pandemic's economic fallout has been catastrophic for many small businesses. With that in mind, next session I will be looking at policies that support our small businesses, create more jobs and help restore California to its historic place as the economic engine that drives the national economy.

""This was an unprecedented election, and it's still not even done,"" said Supervisor Karen Spiegel, who was joined by Supervisor Manuel Perez in calling for the ""after-action review.""
""Things happened differently, and we need this review,"" she said. ""We need a summary, so we can look at strengths and weaknesses and find out what we can do better. There are concerns from some constituents.""
Spiegel did not cite specific problem areas, but said she hoped the review might illuminate points of concern that the board intends to discuss in 60 days.
No anomalies were uncovered in the canvass of ballots cast countywide in the Nov. 3 general election, which is now in litigation in five states stemming from President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of ""systemic fraud.""
No recount was requested in Riverside County.
The board approved Registrar of Voters Rebecca Spencer's official ""statement of votes cast,"" certifying the ballots recorded countywide, as well as authorizing expenses associated with the election.
According to the registrar, 1,016,896 registered voters — 82 percent of those eligible — cast ballots.
""As a result of the significant interest in the presidential election, both the total number and the percentage eclipse previous voter turnout records,"" according to a joint statement by Spiegel and Perez, posted to the board's agenda.
""This year, every registered voter received a vote-by-mail ballot,"" they stated. "" For those individuals who preferred to vote in person ... in-person early voting was available for the first time. The net effect of these changes was almost 650,000 ballots were cast, and received, before election day.""
The supervisors said this ""new model"" for voting opens opportunities, but also merits a second look.
The goal is for the after-action review to increase understanding of best practices for the future.
""The review will be conducted with a commitment to openness, frank discussion, clarity and commitment to identifying and recommending solutions,"" the supervisors wrote.
The Executive Office's report is due by Feb. 9."

On December 7th, the organizational session for the State Assembly's 2021-2022 convened in Sacramento. But this year, things looked a lot different than normal. Though a few bills were introduced, the Speaker and other Assembly officers were sworn in, and resolutions related to operating the House were adopted, the event was not held at the State Capitol building as usual.
Because of COVID restrictions, the new session began at Golden 1 Center, the first time since 1907 that the organizational session was held at someplace other than the Capitol. All members entering the Golden 1 Center were tested for COVID. Masks were worn and social distancing observed. No guests or family members allowed. Typically, the day before, the Governor welcomes all members at a reception, but this year the restrictions in place prevent that.
Historic milestones include the swearing-in of Alex T. Lee, who at 25 is the youngest legislator since the 1930s, and the continuing service of Steven Choi, who became the oldest freshman Assemblyman since the end of WWII when he was elected in 2016.
Because of the remote location of the ceremonies, all votes were voice votes, the first time that's happened since the 1930s. This year marks the first time the Assembly Republican Caucus has grown in a presidential election year since 1984, and the number of women in the caucus is also increasing from two last session to five this session. And for real trivia buffs, Assemblymembers Thurston Smith and Chris Ward became the first two German-born legislators to join the Assembly since John D. Siebe and Christian Went in 1880.
Our new session begins in earnest on January 4th and I'm eager to begin what's going to be a very significant year for California.
