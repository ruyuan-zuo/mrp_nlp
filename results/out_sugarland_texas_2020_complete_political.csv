Gates was running against Democrat Elizabeth ""Eliz"" Markowitz. Final unofficial voting results from Fort Bend County show Gates with 58.05 percent of the vote and Markowitz with 41.95 percent of the vote. The unofficial vote totals include early, absentee and votes from election day. The Fort Bend County elections website shows that all 20 voting centers are reporting results.
Just over 30,000 votes were cast in the race.
The race went to a runoff after the Nov.5 general election did not result in a clear winner. In that election, Markowitz came away with 39.06 percent of the vote while Gates finished behind her with 28.45 percent of the vote. A total of seven candidates — six Republicans and one Democrat — were on the ballot in November to fill the seat vacated by Republican John Zerwas.

Read more about the competitive nature of the race and the support coming in from high-profile Democrats and Republicans via The Texas Tribune.
""Texas House District 28 is a historically Republican district that went to Mitt Romney by 30 points in 2012 and Donald Trump by 10 points in 2016,"" Texas Democrats said in a statement on election day. ""The only reason why House District 28 is close, is because of the quality of candidate that Dr. Eliz Markowitz is, despite getting outspent nearly 2-1 and despite this being a special election -- historically suggesting low-turnout for Democrats.""
Democrats contended they have an ""opportunity"" to win the district and the Tribune noted that the district is far from the most competitive being targeted.
On Monday, Texas Democrats released a list of 22 highly competitive State House districts that are currently held by Republicans, which included district 28. Each member of the Texas House of Representatives is up for reelection in 2020.
State Democrats say they only need nine seats to flip the State House.
Gates was also targeted by ads from a super PAC that resurfaced allegations Gates' mistreated his children in the past, according to The Texas Tribune. The case was eventually dropped by Child Protective Services and Gates pursued legal action against the agency, according to the Tribune."

Olson, 56, who has served the 22nd Congressional District since 2009, said in a statement that he needs to be a ""more consistent presence"" as his mother-in-law deals with her personal health issues.
""For six terms, the voters of our district have placed their faith in me to represent their concerns in the House of Representatives. The time I have spent working with them and for them has been a tremendous blessing.

A number of local Democrats have announced their intentions to run for Olson's seat including Pearland's Nyanza Davis Moore, Sugar Land's Sri Kulkarni, who narrowly lost to Olson in the midterm election, and Pearland councilman Derrick Reed who made his announcement on Monday.

4,/texas/sugarland/sugar-lands-2020-budget-include-homestead-increase,2019-07-02T18:06:32Z,Homestead Exemption Increases In 2020,0,0,Bryan Kirk,Patch Staff,"SUGAR LAND, TX — Homeowners in Sugar Land are getting a bit of a break on their homestead exemption after the city council voted last week for an increase of 12 percent. City leaders said the increase will help offset the residential impact of a planned tax rate increase of approximately 1 cent, which will help fund the final phases of parks bond projects.
The city has been slowly working through the parks bond, which was approved by voters in November 2013.
The strategies are part of a larger ""Sugar Land Way"" strategy — a commitment to bold and thoughtful thinking designed to make life sweeter and more refined for the people and businesses that call Sugar Land home.
""The strategy allows the city to move forward with fulfilling its commitment to implement voter-approved projects within five to seven years from the election while also rebalancing the residential share of the overall tax burden — a recognition that residential revaluation has outpaced commercial value growth in recent years,"" said Mayor Joe Zimmerman.
The projects will be completed with no additional tax impact to Sugar Land residents because of the homestead exemption increase, Zimmerman added.
""Going into the fiscal year 2020 budget process, our priorities are to ensure that the upcoming budget reflects the priorities our residents have told us are important to them, builds trust within the community and inspires pride in our hometown,"" he said.
Three projects remain from the 2013 voter-approved general obligation parks bond:
City leaders said the city council's goal is to continue refining the scopes of the final voter-approved parks bond projects throughout the budget process to reflect all available information, including updated cost estimates and the availability of grant opportunities.
Meanwhile, officials said the city council is considering an approximate $90 million bond election for November to fund drainage projects and other priorities addressed by residents in the most recent Citizen Satisfaction Survey.
If it's approved it would represent an investment of approximately 3 cents on the tax rate or about $10 per month for the average Sugar Land homeowner to fund items such as drainage improvements, a public safety training facility, a public safety dispatch and emergency operations facility, an animal shelter expansion and road projects."

City Manager Allen Bogard, who has 25 years with the City of Sugar Land, and 19 as its city manager, announced his retirement to the Sugar Land City Council on June 18.
""I'd like to thank our current and former members of City Council for the opportunity to work in a special place like Sugar Land,"" Bogard said.
In October 2001, Bogard replaced David Neeley as the city manager and vowed to leave the city in as good or better condition than he'd received it from Neeley.
""We have achieved a lot during the last two decades, but the credit should go to our effective, ethical elected leaders and our champion employees,"" Bogard said. ""I'm confident that the talent within our family of dedicated employees will continue to exceed the high expectations we set for ourselves.""
During the last two decades, Sugar Land has become known as a city dedicated to doing things differently, and has more than doubled in population under Bogard's leadership.
During his tenure, the City has experienced the development of Sugar Land Town Square, First Colony Mall, Constellation Field, the Smart Financial Centre at Sugar Land, the University of Houston at Sugar Land and the Houston Museum of Natural Science at Sugar Land.
In addition, Bogard has provided leadership for numerous annexations, including First Colony, Avalon, RiverPark, Greatwood and New Territory.
""Allen has done an outstanding job in building an exceptional team, and we wish him well in his future endeavors,"" said Mayor Joe R. Zimmerman. ""Our city is safer than ever before, our economy is strong, and we continue to offer the high level of services our citizens expect while maintaining one of the state's lowest tax rates.""
Zimmerman added that while it will be impossible to replace Bogard's unwavering leadership, the city has worked hard to focus on developing future leaders within our organization.
""A number of high-profile promotions during the recent past are proof that Allen's efforts have left us in good hands,"" Zimmerman said.
Bogard will officially end his tenure as City Manager on Jan. 31, 2020.

The city is looking for 15 to 20 resident volunteers who are leaders, and who represent a diverse cross-section of the city, to serve on the Census Complete Count Committee.
""We are now less than a year away from the next decennial census,"" said Director of Planning Lisa Kocich-Meyer. ""Census Day is April 1, 2020, and we need help from our residents to get the word out.""
Kocich-Meyer said the committee members are there to inform residents about the importance and benefits of completing and submitting the 2020 Census questionnaire, and to encourage every household to participate.
The committee will conduct local educational initiatives, as well as publicity and promotional activities to increase community participation and the response rate to the 2020 Census.
Committee members will also be asked to utilize their local knowledge, expertise and influence to plan and implement a census awareness campaign targeted to the Sugar Land community.
The committee's work is anticipated to begin in August and extend through June 2020.
Every 10 years, the US Census Bureau, conducts a count of everyone living in the United States, creating national awareness of the importance of the census and its valuable statistics.
The decennial census was first taken in 1790, as mandated by the U.S. Constitution. It counts population and households, providing the basis for reapportioning congressional seats, redistricting and distributing more than $675 billion in federal funds annually to support states, counties and local communities' vital programs — impacting education, transportation, employment, health care, public policy and more.
As such, having an accurate census count is critical to the city's ability to leverage federal funding for Sugar Land Way priorities such as transportation and mobility, public safety and emergency preparedness — which further helps the city maintain the second lowest property tax rate in the State of Texas among cities of similar size.
Applications for the committee are available by clicking here through July 1.

7,/texas/sugarland/richmond-woman-indicted-defrauding-550k-elderly-man,2019-06-05T18:51:49Z,Richmond Woman Indicted On Federal Fraud Charges,0,0,Bryan Kirk,Patch Staff,"HOUSTON — A 40-year-old Richmond woman was indicted by a federal grand jury on May 30 for her role in a scheme to defraud a 94-year-old man. A federal grand jury returned the four-count indictment against Amy Anglin aka Amy Powell who was arrested on Wednesday by Harris County Pct. 1 deputy constable and federal agents.
""Because of the complex nature of these case, the Department of Justice is uniquely suited to investigate and prosecute elder fraud,"" said U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick. ""As the Attorney General has stressed, elder fraud will not be taken lightly and sadly this is just one of many similar allegations that we see routinely. I thank the family for bringing this case to the attention of law enforcement and we will do everything in our power to make sure justice is served on Ms. Anglin.""
Anglin is charged with two counts of fraud and two counts of making false statements to federal employees. Prosecutors said Anglin began working for a successful real estate developer in Houston in approximately 2015 when the victim was 91-years old and his eyesight was beginning to fail.
Anglin allegedly took advantage of the victim's poor health and stole money from his bank accounts and misused his credit cards to purchase, among other things, airline tickets for herself and her family, according to court documents.
Prosecutors said Anglin also convinced her elderly victim to sign checks he believed were legitimate and authorized expenditures, and instead deposited the funds into her personal account, according to the charges.
""I cannot articulate how disturbed I am by allegations in this case,"" said Pct. 1 Constable Alan Rosen. ""I take seriously any possible crimes against the elderly, particularly those who are disabled. This woman is charged with taking advantage of a man who is 54 years her senior. I appreciate the collaborative efforts of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in pursuing this case and ensuring justice is served.""
Anglin would also illegally convert the victim's assets by use of both his bank account and his credit cards, according to the indictment. In addition to using her access to the victim's banking accounts and business credit cards, the charges allege Anglin wired herself large amounts of money and used Western Union to transfer the victim's money to her friends and acquaintances.
Anglin allegedly transferred funds from the victim's accounts to pay for vacations in Las Vegas, resorts in Hawaii and trips to her hometown.
Anglin also used the stolen money to pay for country club memberships, golf lessons, overdue child support payments and major home improvements, including a hot tub, according to the indictment. The charges further allege that at no time during the fraud scheme was Anglin authorized to make these transfers or payments.
Prosecutors said it was not until the victim's family began to question some of the transactions that Anglin's scheme was uncovered .
With the help of a Houston-based attorney, the family has estimated the total amount of fraud associated with Anglin's scheme to be more than $550,000.
If she is convicted of wire fraud, Anglin faces up to 20 years in federal prison, while a conviction for making false statements, carries a potential five-year-prison term.

Events that occurred after the discovery follow:
The disposition of the remains is the legal responsibility of the school district, and they have decided to reinter the remains where they were found if legally possible.

A federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment against Warren Christopher Clark, 34, Jan. 23, 2019. The indictment was unsealed Friday during Clark's initial court appearance.
Clark was captured in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces, transferred to U.S. law enforcement custody this week and arrived yesterday in the Southern District of Texas.
""The arm of American Justice has a lengthy reach,"" said U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick. ""The number one priority of the Southern District of Texas, along with the FBI and our other national security partners, is to keep America safe. The protection of life is the most sacred job law enforcement has.""
Clark, who grew up in a Christian family with ties to the military, reportedly converted to Islam in 2004, and became radicalized shortly after his conversion.
Clark aka Abu Muhammad, offered his support to ISIS in the form of a resume and cover letter, offering to teach English to ISIS fighters in Syria.
The documents were found in a house in Iraqi territory that was formerly controlled by ISIS and was obtained by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, according to a NBC News report.
Clark is charged with attempting to provide himself as material support to ISIS, which the Secretary of State designated as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
""The FBI continues to aggressively pursue individuals who attempt to join the ranks of ISIS's foreign fighters or try to provide support for other terrorist organizations. This fight against terrorism is not one we can combat alone,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Perrye Turner. ""The FBI relies on our domestic counterparts and foreign law enforcement agencies, as well as the public. Anyone who has information about individuals who have traveled or are planning to travel overseas to support terrorist groups should report it immediately to their local FBI office.""
The charges for providing material support carries a possible penalty of up to 20 years in federal prison and a maximum $250,000 fine, upon conviction, officials said.

18,/texas/sugarland/sugar-land-seeks-partner-new-hotel-conference-center,2019-01-22T22:24:19Z,Sugar Land  Seeks Partnership In Land Deal,0,0,Bryan Kirk,Patch Staff,"From The City of Sugar Land
SUGAR LAND, TX — The city of Sugar Land released a Request for Statements of Interest on Jan. 18 to begin selection of a private-sector partner for a future hotel and convention (conference) center project - the next step in fulfilling the vision for five specific destination venues outlined by a citizen-led task force in 2007.
Overall, these efforts are part of a larger, successful strategy that has been in place for more than a decade to grow and solidify Sugar Land's reputation as an economic powerhouse and destination location - as well as increase the city's financial resilience through the development of unique destination venues.
The project is planned to be located on city-owned property adjacent to the Smart Financial Centre at Sugar Land and plaza near U.S. Highway 59 and University Boulevard.
The city has a long history of partnering with industry leaders to develop destination venues, as it did on the first two venues recommended by the citizen-led Visioning Task Force in 2007 and confirmed by voters in 2008 - Constellation Field, home of the Atlantic League Champion Skeeters, and Smart Financial Centre at Sugar Land.
Similar to these two successful projects, no general property tax dollars will support the development or operation of the new hotel and convention (conference) center project.
The hotel and convention (conference) center project is seen as a key component of an arts and entertainment district and is intended to complement the Smart Financial Centre, a 6,400-seat live entertainment venue that has annually attracted more than 350,000 paid attendees during its first two years of operation, earning continued global recognition as one of the world's top 10 theatre venues and providing a projected annual benefit to the community of $26.1 million over 30 years.
The proposed hotel and convention (conference) center site is also located in a major primary employment center that includes Texas Instruments, Fluor Corporation's planned new campus and the University of Houston - Sugar Land.
With these commitments for the creation of an exciting office and entertainment-centric, mixed-use regional activity center, the city continues to expand its economy, adding jobs and generating new revenue that ensures Sugar Land is able to fund the high level of services expected by residents while maintaining one of the state's lowest tax rates.
""Several years ago, citizens developed a vision for the future that included this project, and we are now at the brink of adding an asset that will improve the quality of life and financial well-being of our city,"" said Director of Economic Development Elizabeth Huff. ""Just like the other projects we are continuing to pursue and support - such as a world-class light industrial business park on the former Central Unit prison property and the transformation of the Imperial Sugar refinery site into a thriving regional activity center - we fully expect this venue will spur additional commercial and retail growth that further establishes Sugar Land as one of the strongest economies in the region.""
Consistent with the established practice of protecting the city's business and financial interests, the city envisions the selection of a private development partner who will bring financial resources and construction expertise to build and operate a 350-room nationally branded hotel and a convention (conference) center of up to 50,000 square feet as recommended by a previously completed feasibility study.
Adjacent structured parking is anticipated, as well as the reservation of space within the overall site for a community cultural arts venue - the fifth venue recommended by citizens in 2007.
Any city support of the project will be limited to capital investment from project-generated revenues and funds restricted by state law for tourism and economic development purposes - further offsetting the demand on property taxes for residents through the resulting economic growth.
