Rep. Jeff Yaroch voted in favor of a new Michigan state budget investing more in education, roads and other essential services – without a tax increase.
Yaroch's votes came as the Legislature completed its work on a new state budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Last week, Yaroch helped approve substantially increased investment in Michigan students as part of the same overall budget.
The schools budget includes $15.2 billion for Michigan students, increasing the foundation allowance by more than $300 million – up to $240 more per student. Additional support is provided for special education, early literacy, school safety and several other programs.
""As the son of a 1st grade teacher, it's incredibly important to me that we continue to correct the inequity in per pupil funding that Proposal A was meant to fix,"" Yaroch said. ""This budget invests more in every Michigan student, to help them succeed regardless of whether they choose a four-year degree or a skilled trade.""
Yaroch serves as chair of the House's budget subcommittee for the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. As part of his plan for the LARA budget, Yaroch fought to secure funding for the First Responders Presumed Coverage Fund after the governor's budget proposal failed to provide sustained funding for it. The fund is used to help firefighters with job-related cancers.
""This fund is crucial to ensuring that we take care of the firefighters who take care of us,"" said Yaroch, who served as a firefighter and paramedic for 27 years before becoming a state legislator. ""I'm pleased we were able to shore up the fund and I am committed to a deep dive to pursue long-term funding options.""
The LARA budget includes funding for the state's urban search and rescue team which was also not funded in the governor's budget. This is an important resource that brings unique rescue assets in times of crisis. The Bureau of Fire Services also received additional funding to assist with firefighter training on foam with PFAS.
The Legislature's budget also places a priority on:
""I believe we took a serious needs versus wants approach to prioritize spending,"" Yaroch said. ""I think the residents in my district feel taxed out and they are looking for our state to live within its budget. Unlike Congress, I am confident that the Michigan Legislature and the governor will put people before partisan politics and get the budget done without a shut down."""

United Way for Southeastern Michigan President and CEO Dr. Darienne Driver to join nearly 80 new United Way executives on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. as part of the New Presidents Forum. The freshmen executives intend to amplify and call attention to the EITC via a digital advocacy call-to-action effort in support of expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), considered the most effective anti-poverty tool in the nation. Dr. Driver and her fellow executives will unite in D.C. on behalf of working families for EITC Advocacy Day on Thursday, January 10, 2019.


""This effort speaks to the core of our service within communities toward uplifting people out of poverty and improving lives in measurable and lasting ways,"" says Dr. Driver. ""The EITC is an important viable tool with immediate impact on the lives of working families, helping them keep more of what they earn to pay for life's necessities such as groceries, child care and more. I look forward to joining my fellow United Way executives in this show of unity around this important issue.""


Data from the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) report created by the Michigan Association of United Ways (MAUW) and released last year, shows that among Michigan's 3.86 million households 15 percent earn below the federal poverty level and another 25 percent are ALICE, down slightly from 2010 but still above the 2007 level. In recent years, Michigan's economy saw only incremental growth making it difficult for many households to improve their financial status. Between 2012 and 2015, the economy showed signs of improvement, yet 40 percent of households in Michigan struggled financially, as the cost of living continued to exceed what most wages paid. MAUW is planning to release its latest ALICE report in March.


United Way for Southeastern Michigan seeks the public's support in joining this effort by contacting their members of congress at http://cqrcengage.com/unitedway/lookup. They may also help amplify the benefits of the EITC via their Facebook and Twitter using the hashtags: #ExpandEITC #UWAdvocate #UWNewCEOs.


Driver's visit on Thursday will mark the second time in three years a United Way CEO has traveled to D.C. to advocate on behalf of those in underserved communities in southeast Michigan. In 2016, former United Way President Dr. Herman Gray was invited to a White House Forum on the Social Innovation Fund to give opening remarks.

State Reps. Steve Marino and Jeff Yaroch today sent Gov. Rick Snyder letters calling on him to exercise his authority to remove a Macomb Township trustee from office.
Rep. Marino said Trustee Dino Bucci has exhibited corrupt conduct in office and gross neglect of duty, both of which the governor can use as grounds for his removal under the Michigan Constitution.
""Dino Bucci's actions while serving as both a township trustee and public servant in the Macomb County Department of Public Works are disgraceful and unacceptable,"" Marino said. ""Even more shameful is the fact that he continues to receive cadillac health benefits, collect a salary, and hold his title while skipping meetings and avoiding all other official responsibilities.""
Rep. Yaroch said: ""Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller has relieved Mr. Bucci of his duties at the Macomb County Works office, which is rebuilding the trust of Macomb County in that department. It is time for Gov. Snyder to do the same to rebuild the trust of our citizens in their government.""
Bucci was indicted by a federal grand jury in November 2017 on eighteen counts of conspiracy, bribery, embezzlement, extortion, mail fraud and money laundering. The charges are in connection with public contracts in Macomb Township and the Macomb County Department of Public Works, where he worked until 2017.
""Trustee Bucci has clearly lost the trust and confidence of both his colleagues and the public,"" Marino said. ""If he won't resign, it's time for Gov. Snyder to exercise the authority granted to him by the state constitution and allow our community to begin the healing process.""
The legislators, who each represent a portion of Macomb Township in the Michigan House, also sent letters to the Attorney General's Office requesting a formal opinion clarifying the governor's authority to remove Bucci from office."

Dunn declined to elaborate beyond the fact that there was a threat and that the Township was taking it ""very seriously"" and that the sheriff's department was investigating.
On March 1, Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham told reporters that the threat in question was a comment from a woman in the audience that someone should shoot Dunn. The sheriff's office is still interested in speaking with the woman, according to Wickersham.
Dunn didn't elaborate on the actual threat, but did remind the assembled crowd that the meetings are conducted under the eye of an armed sheriff's deputy.
""Outbursts from the audience and shouts of encouragement or discouragement will no longer be tolerated. If such an outburst occurs the meeting will be stopped for a recess,"" Dunn said.
Since 2016, the large public corruption scandal involving Macomb County public officials, including Dunn's fellow board members Clifford Frietas and Dino Bucci, have made the meetings extremely volatile. Dunn is no stranger to controversy. In 2013, she pleaded no contest to charges of election fraud amid allegations she falsified signatures needed to place her on the ballot, and in 2017, she paid a $100 fine and singed a conciliation letter for violating state election law by using one of the township's fax machines for campaign activity.

Prosecutors, in a federal court filing, say that he attempted to intimidate and retaliate against a key witness, with whom he was ordered to avoid.
A hearing on the prosecutor's demands has been set for Thursday morning before federal court Judge Robert H. Cleland, who has presided over Rizzo's case. Rizzo has been ordered to be there.
Rizzo, the former CEO of garbage hauler Rizzo Environmental Services, pleaded guilty in November to conspiring to commit bribery and wire fraud, in connection with millions of dollars of municipal garbage contracts in Macomb County and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from his company. His case is part of a wide-reaching federal probe into corruption in Wayne and Macomb counties.
Rizzo faces a maximum of 10 years in prison, and is to be sentenced March 13.
""Revocation of bond is especially appropriate here, as defendant's sentencing date is fast approaching,"" prosecutors wrote in the document. Authorities have told him to be ready to be taken into custody on the day of his sentencing.
According to the court document filed by prosecutors on Tuesday, Rizzo was to ""avoid all contact, directly or indirectly, with any person who is or may become a . . . witness in the investigation or prosecution."" Rizzo, though, met with a witness in the case at the MGM hotel in Detroit.
""Rizzo began by berating Witness A, stating that it was Witness A's fault that Rizzo was going to jail for as long as he was,"" according to the document. It notes that Rizzo chastised the witness for telling prosecutors that a theft scheme at Rizzo's company began in 2014 and that the amount of money taken from the company exceeded $500,000.
Prosecutors noted in the document that if the amount stolen exceeds $550,000, it increases the level of the crime perpetrated.
The witness is key to the case because the unidentified person revealed to federal authorities that Rizzo's criminal activity was happening while Rizzo was supposedly cooperating with investigators.
""Rizzo is well aware that the government's discovery of criminal conduct during his cooperation played a role in significantly increasing the prison time that Rizzo now faces at sentencing,"" prosecutors said in the document. ""Had the government not discovered Rizzo's criminal conduct while he was cooperating, it is likely that the government would have agreed to make a much lower sentencing recommendation.""
Prosecutors say that before Rizzo is sentenced, a pre-sentencing investigation into the case will determine how long his prison term will be. Prosecutors also worry that he will try to contact other witnesses in the case.

The charges are in connection with a wide-ranging ""pay-to-play"" scandal that involved other Macomb County and business officials.
Bucci, if convicted, could be looking at decades in prison and thousands of dollars in fines, according to a statement from acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Lamisch.
Bucci, according to the indictment, was involved in a 9-year-long bribery conspiracy with other politicians and contractors. He directed contractors to pay him tens of thousands of dollars in cash, checks and gift cards in exchange for work and contracts with the township and county governments. As an elected official, Bucci also pressed the same people to donate to his political campaigns in exchange for contracts, according to court documents.
On the extortion charge, court documents indicate that Bucci threatened to withhold permits for development work and home construction in order to force people to pay him tens of thousands of dollars in cash and kickbacks. On the embezzlement charge, court records indicate that Bucci took thousands of dollars in a variety of schemes. In on case, records show, he awarded a paving job to one contractor, but then had another one do the job for $180,000 and pocketed more than $66,000.
The indictment also accuses Bucci of stealing from Macomb County, noting that he had public employees do personal work for him with publicly-owned equipment, including having his mother's driveway and his own plowed after heavy snowfalls. In another example, the indictment noted that he forced an employee to take his kid to school 25 miles away. And, if employees refused to do the personal work, he threatened to dock their pay, cut overtime and send them to undesirable work locations.
The charges against Bucci are the latest in a scandal that has resulted in several indictments and convictions. Among those who have pleaded guilty for their involvement are Charles ""Chuck"" Rizzo, the CEO of Rizzo Environmental Services, James Pistilli, the former chief engineer at Macomb County Department of Public Works, and Paul Modi, a former engineer that worked with the county.
The case has been investigated by the FBI and IRS.

""Chuck"" Rizzo, the former CEO of garbage hauler Rizzo Environmental Services, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiring to commit bribery and wire fraud, in connection with millions of dollars of municipal garbage contracts in Macomb County and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from his company.
Rizzo faces a maximum of 10 years in prison, according to a statement from the office of acting U.S. Attorney Daniel Lemisch. As part of the plea deal, Rizzo also agreed to forfeit $4 million to the U.S. government. That money represents the proceeds of Rizzo's criminal activity in securing municipal garbage contracts by paying bribes and embezzling money.
Rizzo admitted at the plea hearing in before U.S. District Judge Robert H. Cleland in Port Huron that he conspired to pay bribes to Clinton Township Trustee Dean Reynolds and Macomb Township Trustee Clifford Freitas in order to secure and maintain favorable municipal garbage contracts for his company.
Rizzo admitted giving Reynolds over $50,000 in cash bribes, plus free legal services in order to get a garbage contract extension from Clinton Township. He also admitted to offering to pay Freitas a bribe of $35,000, plus a salary increase, if Freitas voted to put the company's garbage bill on the Macomb Township water bill, which would reduce the company's cost of doing business.
The case is part of the government's wide-ranging corruption investigation centered in Macomb County. The investigation of this case was conducted by the FBI and the IRS.

Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller requested the county loan at a Board of Commissioners meeting to pay for ""capital expenditures and related expenses"" tied to the Fraser sinkhole, according to a press release.
Speaking before the Board of Commissioners, Miller was frank in her assessment of the situation, ""This thing happened on Christmas Eve and we are running up bills...We've been struggling with how we're going to do the financing part of this...We're going to be floating a bond issue at some point here. Probably a 25-year bond issue but our thought was we needed some more cash in the immediacy."" Miller added ""It's our intent to pay it back immediately.""
The $20 million loan will be used to start paying invoices next week, according to Miller. When asked by the Board of Commissioners when Public Works would have a realistic number of the total cost of the looming project, Miller replied ""We're bidding everything out [except the engineers]."" She shared the interceptor that needs to be fixed immediately will run $70-$80 million. However, Miller reported the total cost will probably be ""well north of $100 million dollars""...and she'll have a ""much more definitive answer in March"" as that's when the bids will come in.
The Fraser sinkhole disaster has devastated the county since Dec. 24, 2016. That's when a sewer line collapse caused a roughly 250 feet long and 100 feet wide sinkhole in the area of 15 Mile Rd. and Hayes Rd. in Fraser. The 11 communities served by the sewer line have been greatly affected. A water restriction alert has gone into effect to curb water usage and affected residents are also expecting higher water bills, which will start this summer to help pay for sewer repairs.
Last week, Gov. Rick Snyder opened the Disaster and Emergency Contingency Fund to provide financial relief to impacted communities. The move allows affected towns the opportunity to apply for assistance grants of up to $100,000 to pay for Fraser sinkhole-related recovery costs ranging from shelter supplies to civil employees' overtime expenses. Days earlier, the state House and Senate, per Snyder's request, extended the state of emergency declarations through March 31 for Macomb County and Clinton Township, which have been under a state of emergency since Jan. 5 and Jan. 17.

The move affords affected towns the opportunity to apply for assistance grants of up to $100,000 to pay for Fraser sinkhole-related recovery costs ranging from shelter supplies to civil employees' overtime expenses. The Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division will manage the grant and aid local governments with their fund applications, according to the press release.
""I commend the first responders and agencies throughout impacted communities for their dedication to ensuring the health and safety of the citizens who were affected by this incident,"" Snyder said in a statement dated Feb. 3. The governor continued, ""While progress is being made to address the situation, some of the local jurisdiction resources have been depleted. Money from this fund will help cover some of the costs incurred while responding to and recovering from this incident.""
The announcement comes just days after the state House and Senate, per Snyder's request, extended the state of emergency declarations through March 31 for Macomb County and Clinton Township. Macomb County and Clinton Township have been under a state of emergency since Jan. 5 and Jan. 17.

In an interview with Fox 2, Fouts alleges that Macomb County dumped up to 150,000 yards of excavating dirt at the Freedom Hill site without permits and buried methane gas monitoring wells, which he claims released methane gas.
Fouts posted a detailed account of the supposed chain of events and cover-up in a Nov. 27 Facebook post.

Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel lambasted Fout's claims and told Fox 2 there is nothing to hide and everything is out in the open.
Meanwhile, in a Nov. 27 Facebook post, Fouts accused Hackel of feeding the media questions to deflect attention away from the alleged cover-up.
One thing is clear in this tangled case: Fouts' refusal to back down in his quest to expose the reported cover-up.
Fouts did not immediately return Patch's request for a comment.

MACOMB COUNTY, MI — Jim Fouts, the mayor of Warren, posted a foreboding message on Facebook warning that there's a bombshell environmental scandal brewing in Macomb County.
Below is the full post Mayor Jim Fouts wrote on Nov. 16:

The post has triggered a flurry of concerned people to respond, asking if residents of Macomb county are in danger and wondering if their drinking water is safe. The Flint water crisis rocked the state of Michigan. In 2014, Flint switched its water source from the treated Detroit Water and Sewage Department to the Flint River in an effort to save $5 million dollars over a two year period. The water wasn't treated and countless children suffered lead poisoning, and now face a lifetime of neurological issues.
The Office of Macomb County Executive Mark A. Hackel has released a statement assuring residents the water in Macomb county is safe.
Patch has reached out to Mayor Fouts and will update you when he provides a statement.
