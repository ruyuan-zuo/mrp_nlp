Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per week—or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data set—Iowa—and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

McCreery, of Olivette, has formed a campaign committee to run in what is now the 88th district in the Missouri House, which includes parts of Creve Coeur, Olivette, Ladue, Town and Country and Chesterfield. She's looking to succeed Jill Schupp, the Creve Coeur Democrat who is serving her third term in the House. Schupp has launched a campaign for the State Senate.

Before seeking office herself, McCreery was an aide for 8 years in the office of State Senator Joan Bray. She's currently the Manager of Public Policy for PROMO, an organization that lobbies on behalf of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered Persons.

In a brief phone interview with Patch, she promised a campaign that would support Medicaid expansion in Missouri, and put a focus on education. She was critical of leaders in the GOP-controlled House and State Senate who put emphasis and time into issues such as outlawing the use of Sharia law and federal gun law nullification in the last legislative session instead of focusing on the issues surrounding student transfers from unaccredited school districts.

McCreery made no claims regarding the party's chances of retaking the House but sounded an optimistic note about overcoming what is now a veto-proof majority for Republicans in Jefferson City. 

The 88th District consists of parts of five cities but the largest chunk of real estate is in Creve Coeur. While no GOP candidates have emerged as of yet, at least one Republican activist has suggested that the race could be more appealing now, since McCreery isn't from the city.

McCreery, who points to the fact that she won a 2011 special election as an Independent against a Democrat and a Republican candidate backed by the Tea Party, dismissed the notion.

America's epidemic of fatness extends to St. Louis County, with obesity rates at nearly 33 percent for men and 36.8 percent for women in 2011 in the county.
The rate for men jumped 7.4 percentage points for men and 8.6 points for women from 2001 to 2011.
The county figures on the map were obtained from a recent study from the University of Washington, which found that nationwide women are more obese than men.
Obesity in Missouri increased at similar rates, rising for men 8.5 percentage points to 36.6 percent for men; and rising 8.9 points to 38.9 percent for women statewide. Bottom line: The rate of obesity for St. Louis County men is slightly lower than the state average, while the women's rate is slightly higher. 
It's the same story for men when compared to neighboring St. Charles County, where 36.9 percent of men are considered obese; 35.3 percent of St. Charles County women are considered obese.
Both genders track fairly close to the national average, according to the 2011 numbers: 33.8 percent of men nationally are obese (a rate lower than St. Charles County, but just above St. Louis County); 36.1 percent of women nationally are obese. That's higher than the St. Charles County average, but slightly lower than St. Louis County. 
In 2011, obesity prevalence for both genders in the U.S. ranged from 20.7 percent in Colorado to 34.9 percent in Mississippi, according to the CDC.
According to the CDC, obesity affects more than one-third of adults, or 35.7 percent of the population in the United States. Obesity is calculated by measuring a person's height and weight, and deriving at a ratio called the body mass index, or BMI. This number often correlates to an individual's amount of body fat, and is used to ascertain whether a person is considered underweight, a normal weight, overweight or obese.
Obese individuals have a 50-100 percent increased risk of premature death, and it's estimated that obesity may be the cause of 300,000 deaths per year according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Interestingly, Americans claim to be exercising more during the same time period that obesity climbed. 
""Around the country, you can see huge increases in the percentage of people becoming physically active, which research tells us is certain to have health benefits,"" said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray in a press release. Murray added that ""If communities in the US can replicate this success and tackle the ongoing obesity impact, it will see more substantial health gains."""

The sidewalks along Old Bonhomme road need to be repaired.

""There's been crumbling and decaying curbing, streets with potholes and sidewalks that are unsafe for the public,"" Olivette Mayor Missy Waldman told KSDK reporter Grant Bissell in a recently published article.

The money's available, in the form of a $2 million federal grant, according to the KSDK article published July 25, but the funds would require the city sidewalks conform to federal standards required by the Americans With Disabilities Act and there are some areas along Old Bonhomme road that are less than 2 feet wide.

Patch reported last year, on a public hearing held for the sidewalk project, that a 2-mile stretch of sidewalk along Old Bonhomme, south and east from Olive to approximately Irv Zeid Citizen's Park, would be expanded to a width of 5 feet, which would accommodate pedestrians and cyclists. Patch reported that about 15-20 of the approximately 90 affected property owners attended the Oct. 17 public hearing.

Some of the affected homeowners are not happy with the way Olivette has gone about the project. 

""We've been told the city council considers themselves the stewards of Old Bonhomme and that our feelings are only part of what they need to consider and they know better than we do what's best for the homeowners,"" homeowner Hillary Zimmerman told Grant Bissell in the recent KSDK article.

The 24th State Senate district stretches to include portions of Chesterfield to the west, Warson Woods to the south, Maryland Heights to the north and Clayton to the east. The incumbent, John Lamping of Ladue, has said he will likely have a decision about seeking re-election in place by Thanksgiving. 

With the party's likely 2016 gubernatorial candidate Attorney General Chris Koster there to introduce her at the Frontenac Grille, Schupp did not mention Lamping by name, but instead attacked what she called an extreme agenda pushed by the Republican supemajority in both houses, citing efforts to outlaw islamic sharia law, restore the gold standard and nullifying federal laws. Schupp said she would continue to support efforts to expand Medicaid and fully fund K-12 education.

Calling it a race that will be watched by the state and one of the few which will be competitive in 2014, Schupp said she would need to raise $750,000 for a bid that she described as a ""journey back to common sense and trust.""

In his introductory remarks, Koster invoked President John F. Kennedy's last policy speech, given in San Antonio, TX, the day before his death and how Kennedy spoke of throwing a hat over the wall and having no choice but to chase it. The metaphor was used then as a challenge to push Americans into space. 

When asked if the same could be said for Missouri Democrats, looking to chip into a GOP supermajority in the State Senate, Koster said he was realistic.

Dear Resident:

     Old Bonhomme Road is Olivette's most highly utilized city maintained street. It is approximately 2 miles long, extending from the eastern end to very near the western end of the City.

     Many of us who live, work or play in Olivette travel Old Bonhomme Road regularly. It is utilized by motorists, pedestrians and cyclists. It serves many of us by allowing us to get to our homes, places of work, schools, parks, etc.

     It has been many years since Old Bonhomme Road has received any significant maintenance work and, unfortunately, it shows. The City has effectively demonstrated the importance which Old Bonhomme Road has to the community and the road's need for improvement. As a result, the City has received approximately $2,000,000 in federal funding for the improvement of Old Bonhomme from its intersection with Olive Boulevard to its intersection with Price Road.

     These improvements include the removal and replacement of all concrete curbs and gutters, construction of 5'wide sidewalks replacing 4' wide sidewalks, removal of the top wearing surface of the asphalt roadway and installation of a new asphalt surface, and removal and reconstruction of all parts of the roadway which require replacement. 

     The process to affect these improvements is just beginning. You will soon see a survey crew from Volz Engineering, the City's surveying and engineering consultant, in the area gathering information. That information will be utilized to prepare preliminary concept plans which will be made available for all members of the community to review and make comment. We plan to accomplish these aspects of the project this year. Refinement and development of the plans, as well as actual construction of the project are planned for 2013.

     If you have any questions or comments concerning this project, please don't hesitate to contact me atmgartenberg@olivettemo.com or 983-0500.
Thank you.

Sincerely yours,
Michael W. Gartenberg, MCM
Director of Public Services
