July 7, 2020
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Ned Lamont signed an executive order allowing all registered voters in Connecticut to vote absentee in the August 11, 2020 primary. Secretary of the State Denise Merrill mailed every registered Democrat and Republican in the state an application that they will need to fill out and return in order to obtain an absentee ballot. That application, which will be sent via U.S. Postal Service, will include a postage paid return envelope. Beginning July 21, 2020, all voters who requested an absentee ballot will receive the ballots in the mail, which will also include a postage paid return envelope.
The Town of Willington will also have a secure ballot drop box, located in the front of the building to allow voters to deliver their absentee ballots in person without close personal contact. For those who would still like to appear in person to cast their vote, our polling locations will remain open, however, the ability to vote absentee will ensure that the democratic process continues safely and securely.

We are humbled by your support and the energy our townspeople put into the elections. It was a lively campaign, and we are committed to the work ahead of us.
We vow to weigh wisely the issues of our aging schools and the best education we can offer our children, to address the crumbling infrastructure in some of our homes and roadways, to push for creative economic development that meshes with our small-town charm, and to be watchful of our tax rate – one of the lowest in the region – as we do all of the above.
But we need your help. We encourage you to take part in town events, share your best thinking with us, and engage our town boards at meetings. The next opportunity for the public is our Nov. 13 town meeting, Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Old Town Hall on the Green. Several meaty issues are on tap for a yea or nay vote.
We hope to see you there, offering your questions and comments.

The Stafford Bark Park, run by an all-volunteer committee, has been proposed to sit on a 1.75 acre piece of land at 15 Buckley Highway, currently owned by Judith and David Mordasky, operators of Stafford Veterinary Center. Judith Mordasky told the commission she and her husband plan to donate the piece of property to the town, which would in turn lease it to the Bark Park committee.
A presentation by dog park spokesperson Bion Williamson indicated plans call for construction of a 100 foot by 200 foot fenced-in dog park on the property, with separate sides for large and small dogs. The Bark Park committee would be responsible for maintaining the grounds, as well as all liability.
Parking would primarily be in the rear portion of the adjacent lot behind the Stafford Senior Center, which was a concern for the director of the center, Grace Parrow. She noted that many of the seniors that come to the center use canes and walkers, and if there are a lot of dogs in the lot, they may become startled or trip and fall, according to meeting minutes.
During the public comment portion of the meeting, several residents spoke in favor of the park, while others had questions pertaining to the plans. Commission members unanimously voted to continue the hearing until the next P & Z meeting, which is scheduled for July 23."

Joe Courtney (CT-02) on Wednesday joined Glenn ""GT"" Thompson (PA-15), and Bill Pascrell, Jr. (NJ-09) to reintroduce the Fire Police Fairness Act, bipartisan legislation Courtney said would extend public safety officer death benefits to fire police.
Fire police officers provide emergency response services in 14 states across the United States, including Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, Courtney said. But, because there is ""no uniform national designation for fire police,"" they face ""additional and unnecessary hurdles"" in accessing benefits that other public safety officers receive, he said.
""Fire police across eastern Connecticut serve critical roles protecting both the public and their fellow public safety officers by securing the areas around dangerous emergencies,"" Courtney said. ""They respond alongside police and fire services, and put themselves in harm's way to protect our communities. For more than forty years, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program has provided peace of mind to public safety officers and their families with the assurance that our country will honor their service by providing certain benefits should they be killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. I am proud to once again introduce this legislation alongside Congressmen Thompson and Pascrell to ensure that fire police are eligible for these same benefits.""
Courtney originally authored and introduced the Fire Police Fairness Act in 2011 after the Chief of the Gales Ferry Volunteer Fire Company, Anthony Saccone, brought the issue to Courtney's attention. He has introduced the legislation each in each Congress since.
The National Volunteer Fire Council, which represents volunteer firefighters and emergency personnel, announced its support of the legislation in a letter published Wednesday afternoon. Click here to read the letter of support.
The International Association of Fire Chiefs, which represents the leadership of firefighters and emergency responders worldwide, has also announced support for the Fire Police Fairness Act. Click here to read the letter of support."
15,/connecticut/stafford-willington/courtney-larson-get-specifics-irs-crumbling-foundation-credit,2019-04-12T17:45:15Z,U.S. Reps Get Specifics On Foundation Credit,0,0,Chris Dehnel,Patch Staff,"WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Reps Joe Courtney (CT-02) and John Larson (CT-01) said Thursday that the Internal Revenue Service has provided them with ""clarifying information that will offer additional tax relief to homeowners affected by the crumbling foundations crisis.""
In a letter to Courtney, the IRS confirmed that homeowners with crumbling foundations can apply for the federal casualty loss deduction to certain repairs linked to fixing their crumbling foundation not covered by the Connecticut Foundations Solutions Indemnity Company.
Specifically, the IRS's letter confirms that if the repaired structure was damaged by the crumbling foundation or needed to be damaged or destroyed to repair the foundation, the cost of the repair of the item would be eligible for federal tax relief under the Revenue Procedures that the IRS has published.

""Today's clarification from the IRS is more forward momentum for homeowners in our region impacted by the crumbling foundations crisis,"" Courtney said. ""The process of repairing a home's foundation can come along with collateral damage, and those damages and subsequent repairs should qualify under the federal casualty loss deduction. CSFIC has already provided excellent assistance for homeowners needing to make crumbling foundations repairs, and for many homeowners with tens of thousands of dollars in remaining costs even after their claim by CSFIC was approved, this guidance from the IRS takes another step towards making them financially whole.""
Read more about the Connecticut Foundations Solutions Indemnity Company here.

""This is good news for homeowners who suffer stress and uncertainty from the discovery of crumbling foundations in their home,"" Larson said. ""They should not have to worry that fixing the problem will cost them even more money or damage to their home. Additional damage that occurs beyond a foundation to a home as a result of fixing a crumbling foundation will now be rightfully covered under the federal casualty loss deduction. I thank the IRS for their guidance and Congressman Courtney for his leadership on this issue.""
Michael Maglaras, the superintendent of the Connecticut Foundations Solutions Indemnity Company said the first house was repaired on April 3 and, ""Within the next four weeks we will raise three dozen houses.""
He added, ""This will make all the difference in the world to the victims of this crisis.""
After hearing from homeowners who had questions about the interaction between CFSIC's coverage of crumbling foundations repairs and the casualty loss deduction, on Feb. 28, Courtney wrote to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to inquire as to whether the agency would deem certain expenses not directly related to restoring the structural integrity of a home's foundation as eligible for casualty loss deduction. In his letter, Courtney noted that CSFIC (also known as the ""captive"" insurance company) is capped at paying $175,000 per home with a crumbling foundation, and is limited to only paying for expenses pertaining to repairing the crumbling foundation itself to a structurally safe condition. In their response, the IRS made clear that certain other fixes could also be eligible for casualty loss deduction.

To read the letter from the IRS, which provides examples of allowable expenses, click here.
In October of 2018, Courtney and Larson announced that the IRS would allow homeowners with crumbling foundations to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss, should their casualty loss to fix their foundation exceed their annual tax liability. This clarification means that even if the net loss suffered by a homeowner exceeds their annual federal tax liability, they can carry forward that loss for up to 20 years.

In November of 2017, the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2017-60 to enact a ""safe harbor"" for the treatment of crumbling foundation-related repair costs as a ""casualty loss"" deduction from a taxpayer's taxable income under Section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Republican tax-overhaul signed into law in December, temporarily limits the applicability of Section 165. Under the law, beginning in tax year 2018 only taxpayers who suffer damage related to a presidentially-declared Stafford Act disaster may deduct their property-casualty losses. This provision expires in 2025.
In a December 21, 2017 letter to Courtney and Larson, the IRS confirmed that homeowners who had already completed repairs to their home before the end of 2017 would be able to claim the costs on their federal tax returns for 2017, or any open prior year.
Taxpayers have three years from the date they filed their original tax return to file Form 1040X to amend their return (and claim this deduction). The updated revenue procedure extends the ""safe harbor"" through the period that 2017 returns can be amended, expected to be the filing season in spring of 2021.
Homeowners should consult with a qualified tax preparer to see if they qualify for the deduction, Courtney said."
16,/connecticut/stafford-willington/school-related-crumbling-foundations-bill-passes-fed-committee,2019-02-26T20:53:29Z,School-Related Crumbling Foundations Bill Passes,0,0,Chris Dehnel,Patch Staff,"WASHINGTON, DC — A federal legislative committee on Tuesday passed a bill that would privide relief for schools affected by crumbling foundations.
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney (CT-02), a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee, said the Rebuild America's Schools Act (H.R. 865), contains provisions (authored by Courtney) to provide relief for schools facing structural damage amid the crumbling concrete foundations crisis.
The Committee-passed legislation includes a Courtney amendment that adds repairs to crumbling foundations due to pyrrhotite as an ""allowable use of funds that can be dispersed to eradicate severe health and safety threats"" to schools.
The bill contains a new title (authored by Courtney) to create ""a new grant program for schools to repair or replace their foundation or any affected structures deteriorating due to pyrrhotite."" The amendment was included as Title V in the final version of the bill, which was reported out of the House Education and Labor Committee by a vote of 26-20, and will now proceed to the full House of Representatives for further consideration.
""I am very pleased that the Education and Labor Committee today reported out a school infrastructure bill which includes a section I authored to help local municipalities with the cost of repairing or reconstructing school buildings that have been impacted by crumbling foundations due to the presence of pyrrhotite,"" Courtney said. ""We know that Birch Grove Primary School in Tolland, CT has already discovered pyrrhotite in the concrete foundation of the school. I'm a strong supporter of the overall bill to rebuild America's public school buildings, and the Committee's recognition that help federal assistance is needed to address the issue of crumbling foundations in schools is a great victory for these communities that have been so seriously harmed by the crumbling foundations crisis.""
Courtney's amendment is included in Title V of the Rebuild America's Schools Act, and would not reduce federal funding to other schools and local education organizations already receiving funding through the main provisions of the bill. Courtney's amendment was written in response to notification that crumbling foundations have affected schools and municipal buildings, in addition to residential homes and condominiums.
On Feb. 25, 2019, U.S. Rep. John Larson (CT-01) wrote to House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott to express support for the provisions Courtney authored in the bill. Click here to read more.
On Feb. 14, Courtney issued a release highlighting the passage of two additional amendments he introduced aimed at providing relief to homeowners harmed amid the crumbling foundations crisis.
