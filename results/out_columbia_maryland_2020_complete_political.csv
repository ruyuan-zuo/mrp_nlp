A bill has been pre-filed authorizing Howard County Executive Calvin Ball to issue the points.
Howard County Fire Chief William Anuszewski said the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the department in numerous ways.
""The county executive recognizes the impact this pandemic has had on the volunteer system and the ability for a volunteer to earn LOSAP points. This legislative change will help lessen the impact for the volunteer membership,"" he noted.
To receive credit for a year of active service, a volunteer must have accumulated at least 50 creditable points during the calendar year. Points are awarded for training courses, drills, elected or appointed positions, attendance at meetings, emergency responses, military service and those with a permanent disability.
""Our members have expressed concern with obtaining their annual points due to the reduced fundraising activities and operational support the pandemic has caused,"" said Howard County Volunteer Firefighters Association President Raymond Wines. ""Our personnel remain committed to volunteer but need to take every precaution in keeping their families healthy. We all strive to accumulate the appropriate points, but these times are challenging. I, personally, thank Executive Ball for his consideration on this matter.""
Ball expressed his appreciation for the volunteers during such a trying time.
""We deeply appreciate the many volunteers who continue to support our department of fire and rescue services and are pleased to provide these benefits to our volunteer members who we rely on for a safe and engaged community,"" he said."

""The modernization of our RTA fleet has been one of our top priorities as we strive to create more reliable and accessible infrastructure for our residents,"" said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball in a statement.

The case stems from FAA changes to flight patterns at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), which the county claims were made ""without proper notice or environmental consideration that have caused terrible noise pollution in some neighborhoods.""
""We're disappointed at the court's ruling and are carefully considering our options moving forward,"" said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball in a statement. ""We know this is a significant issue for our residents and we're not done fighting on behalf of them. In the meantime, we will continue engaging with the BWI Roundtable and encourage the FAA to implement proposed changes to flight paths. We're also urging the state of Maryland to get back on track with the noise abatement plan, which has been severely delayed. Our residents deserve progress and we will continue to pursue all options to provide relief.""
In October 2019, Ball announced a procedural win in one of the county's two ongoing cases against the Federal Aviation Administration in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.

The county has joined the New York lawsuit against the president and his Administration for their July 21, 2020, census policy attempting to ""exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status."" The exclusion of undocumented persons would significantly impact the apportionment of congressional districts and the electoral college. The case was filed in federal court last week, with the state of New York as the lead plaintiff.
""This latest attempt to co-opt the constitutionally mandated census process is illegal and clearly violates our federal laws and standards,"" said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball in a statement. ""Especially now, as the Census Bureau just announced they will end all counting efforts by Sept. 30, there is a greater risk of undercounting populations. Howard County loses out on nearly $18,000 in federal funding for each person not counted in the Census. This funding will support critical programs including our emergency services, medicare, school lunches and so much more. Our federal representation must truly represent all the people in a jurisdiction – no matter their citizenship status. As a community that strives to be inclusive and sees our diversity as our strength, we will not let the current administration continue to scapegoat our immigrant community or intimidate our residents from participating in the census.""
The complaint is expected to be amended this week, at which time Howard County will be added as a plaintiff. The lawsuit challenges the president's disregard for the Constitution, and violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, where it states, ""representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State.""
""Howard County prides itself in the richness of its diversity,"" said Jackie Scott, director of the county department of community resources and services. ""The administration's policy undermines these values and presents a dangerous precedent which could lead to withholding critically needed resources from states and localities; leaving millions of families and children without the ability to meet their basic needs. We urge our federal lawmakers to stand for the moral and civic obligation to care for all people who call America their home and protect their fundamental rights to be heard, counted and represented.""
The Census Bureau announced this week that they are ending all counting efforts by Sept. 30, a month earlier than previously planned of Oct. 31. Across the country, 4 out of 10 households have not been counted, and with limited to no door-knocking efforts, there is a risk of significantly undercounting immigrants, minority populations, and rural households who are less likely to self-report, officials noted. In Howard County the response rate is currently 76.5 percent."

Murder on the Potomac (Capital Crimes Book 12), by Margaret Truman (Fawcett, 2014, 354 pages, $21.00)
The Plot
Two high-powered Washington lawyers change careers and marry each other. Mac becomes a law professor and Annabel runs an art gallery, specializing in pre-Colombian objects. Both become enmeshed in one murder after another.
Mac witnesses a young child fall into the falls and has nightmares which come to fruition when the body of the assistant of a prominent Washington board member is found washed up on the edge of an island in the Potomac. Annabel is on the same board and Mac is a friend of the board member. Clues lead to an affair or two plus some money-lifting.
When numerous people enter the fray, including a comely female detective student of Mac's who is finishing her PhD, an adopted Chinese young man also with a PhD who may be dealing in nefarious characters, a reenactment of a famous killing followed by a black-tie dinner, a young woman wanna-be actress who is the delivery person of unknown objects for her brother who is deeply in debt (gambling), Mac and Annabel are reluctantly drawn into the fray and happen upon the clues that lead to a dangerous solution.
The Author
Yes, the author was the daughter of Harry S. Truman, an only child, well-thought of and a talented classical soprano, actress, journalist, socialite, media personality, and writer.
Mary Margaret Truman, known as Margaret, authored a book about her father, another about her mother, and one about White House pets. Her name is also on this slew of ghostwritten murder mysteries set in Washington, DC, that are fabulous, as you can see.
The Setting
If you live or work in DC or have ever visited the city, you will select a particular Truman mystery that has meaning to you to become enmeshed in first. Perhaps you were in the military (Murder at the Pentagon). Perhaps you are interested in diplomacy (Murder at Foggy Bottom or Murder on Embassy Row), or the arts (Murder at the Kennedy Center), or the law (Murder in the Supreme Court, Murder at the FBI, or Murder in the House).
But, trust me, if you are merely a connoisseur of a good murder mystery tale, you will not become bogged down in the history of our nation's capital. On the other hand, there are just enough tidbits of the famous landmark to bring back memories and educate the political novice. The pace accelerates. . . .

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the county department of housing and community development will not be hosting its regularly scheduled in-person renter and homeownership informational workshops during its July open enrollment period. However, the presentations from each of these informational workshops are available online.
""Homeownership improves economic mobility and expands opportunity for generations as families build wealth,"" said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball in a news release. ""Through our MIHU program, we are creating affordable homeownership opportunities to help families call Howard County home as we foster safe and engaged communities.""
To purchase an MIHU home, individuals must apply during an open enrollment period to be placed in the database. To qualify, an applicant's household income may not exceed 80 percent of Howard County's median income. Applicants must meet minimum credit score requirements and household income must be sufficient to qualify for a mortgage based on industry standards. Sale prices for MIHUs available now currently range from $245,000 for a new condo to $370,000 for a new townhouse. Actual sale prices may vary depending on the size and amenities of the unit.
Homeownership opportunities are currently offered at below-market sales prices in several communities, including Delacour at Blue Stream in Elkridge, Paddock Pointe in Laurel, River Overlook and the Yards at Oxford Square in Hanover, and Trotters Knoll in Ellicott City. Previously owned condominiums and townhomes throughout the county are also for sale under the MIHU program as they become available.

The county received a $9,000 grant to plan a combined heat and power system at the Howard County Detention Center and up to $100,000 to plan a microgrid project at the George Howard Complex and the Roger Carter Center. The microgrid project includes two forms of clean and efficient onsite power generation to improve the resiliency of critical public safety operations.
""Especially in tough times Howard County needs to lead with bold visions for the future,"" said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball in a statement. ""As we anticipate more extreme weather and other adverse effects of climate change these projects will increase our emergency preparedness and our community resiliency, without any additional costs to Howard County residents.""
The microgrid, which can operate independently of the power grid, would allow Howard County to provide uninterrupted public safety and other critical services even in the event of prolonged grid outages, while generating clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The planning and design work funded by the grant will help the County determine the exact configuration of power generation, which likely will include solar and highly efficient natural gas generators, among other technologies.
The microgrid planning project includes four buildings that are part of the Howard County Government Campus on Court House Drive in Ellicott City. These buildings house many critical government functions, including the County's Emergency Operations Center, County Government Administration, County Council, Northern District Police, Fire and Rescue, and other critical services. The microgrid may also extend to the nearby Roger Carter Community Center, an emergency cooling center for the community.
The project at the Howard County Detention Center will include a feasibility study and planning for the installation of a combined heat and power system, which uses the waste heat from onsite energy generation to provide hot water for the building. The system also would enable black start and islanding capability, allowing the facility to operate independent of the grid. The county also has plans to incorporate a rooftop solar photovoltaic array through a separate project which will further improve resiliency while using clean energy.
""Historically, Maryland has imported most of our energy from out of state coal-fired power plants,"" said MEA Director Mary Beth Tung. ""The Resilient Maryland pilot offers a unique opportunity for innovation right here in Maryland across a variety of clean energy alternatives, reducing both financial risk and total project costs.""
The grants are part of MEA's highly-competitive pilot Resilient Maryland program to provide funding for eligible organizations and governments to conduct feasibility analysis, engineering and design plans to increase resiliency of mission critical buildings, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lower the cost of energy. A total of 14 grant applications from across the state have been awarded $1.05 million dollars in funding."

Bringing Vincent Home, by Madeleine Mysko* (Plain View Press, 2007, 182 pages, $14.95)
Bringing Vincent Home was the fifth and final book club selection of the Veterans Book Group in Columbia, Maryland. (For my review itself, read here.) Recently we discussed the group's opinion of the book – with invited guest, author Madeleine Mysko!
During this final session, we were so fortunate to be able to welcome the author herself, Madeleine Mysko, who began by talking about why she wrote the book. It was 10 years in the reminiscing and another 10 in the drafting and rewriting.
Mysko joined the Army not so much out of patriotism as to help soldiers and, as a matter of fact, had always been a writer. She became a nurse, received orders to Viet Nam, got married and, since the Army tried to station (assign) married soldiers together, her travel orders were postponed until her husband could also deploy; however, their contracts expired before they could ship out.
The author began her writing journey with a piece of non-fiction, which morphed into a memoir and finally a work of fiction, a thinly veiled autobiography.
Our book group wholeheartedly recommended Bringing Vincent Home and not only because the author was amongst us on Zoom. One of us had gone to high school in San Antonio, TX, where Vincent took place. Another pair of former soldiers in the group had been nurses; one, even a burn-unit nurse at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio. One had seen duty in Viet Nam as a young officer whose unit experienced four KIAs. Another had been a Vietnamese linguist. All of us felt welcomed into the book and also felt part of the book because we had lived so much of it: we reminisced about the military culture but also about the Berrigans and the Catonsville Nine.
We were fascinated to hear that the author saw herself in several of the characters though not in the protagonist. The novel took place in the late 60s, written by a nurse in 2007 who, at the time the story took place, was the same age as the nurses depicted in the book. The protagonist was the mother of a soldier in 1968 and most of the book club members (and author) are currently in the grandparent age group. Quite a cross-generational experience as the circle goes round and round.
We disagreed as to whether or not the epilogue was necessary, a la The Wonder Years.
Mysko was also concerned whether her memory of the burn unit was authentic: we assured her that most readers would think so and she later suggested that the few who might know burn-units would remember that Vincent is a work of fiction and that authors have poetic license!
Although Bringing Vincent Home could have been titled Kitty's Journey, we all felt that she was the epitome of moms everywhere – things happened to her and through her. It was amazing how much we came to learn about the other characters through the unobtrusive, calm and supportive personality of Kitty, the mom. Everything happens because of her: people open up to her.
First Look
Ah, the cover: Mysko searched far and wide for the perfect depiction of Kitty's house, the home to which Vincent would hopefully return; however, the publisher easily convinced her to feature a depiction of the Viet Nam Wall, a decision Mysko is well pleased with.
Bringing Vincent Home is a book I will take down from my bookshelf at least once a year to read again. It should be required for high school history classes as well as military leadership courses and medical schools.
----------------
Caveat: This book was a selection of the Veteran's Book Group, a program at the Howard County, MD, Public Library.
* Madeleine Mysko also authored two books of poetry: Crucial Blue and In The Margins as well as the longer 2015 novel Stone Harbor Bound. A former burn-unit nurse in the Army, she currently teaches writing in the Baltimore area."

The awards honor innovative, effective county government programs that strengthen services for residents.
""This is the second year in a row Howard County has received significant recognition from NACo for innovative and effective government solutions,"" said Howard County Executive Calvin Ball. ""NACo represents 3,069 county governments across the nation, and Howard County continues to stand out on good governance and creative problem solving. At a time when our government faces unprecedented challenges during a global pandemic, celebrating these achievements is important as innovation will continue to be a central strategy to make Howard County the best place to live, work and play. These awards represent the commitment and creativity of our workforce to serve the public. I am grateful to everyone who works every day to make Howard County the best county in our country.""
NACo has announced the following awards for Howard County:

Historic Preservation and Tax Credit Pre-Approval Program
The Minor Alterations and Executive Secretary Tax Credit Preapproval processes (the program) were created by the department of planning and zoning for the Howard County Historic Preservation Commission following the July 30, 2016, flood in Ellicott City. Due to the high volume of applications the commission received in the months following the flood, the department sought to create an expedited administrative approval process. The goal was to create a process that would expedite the approval of applications for minor alterations and for repairs that qualified for tax credit preapproval while allowing for due process afforded by law. This program required changes to the county code and to the commission's procedures and established a five-day online review process. If, after five days, staff has not received any commission or public objections, then the application is administratively approved as a minor alteration, not requiring commission approval; or it is preapproved for tax credits. This new program has expedited the process for many applicants, facilitated rebuilding of Ellicott City post flood, reduced the workload associated with these applications and resulted in more efficient commission monthly meetings.

""This NACo Award for our Historic Preservation Expedited Review Process is greatly appreciated,"" said department of planning and zoning director Amy Gowan. ""This process was created to respond to the 2016 Ellicott City flood so that the community could rebuild expeditiously while safeguarding the heritage of the town. Over 400 properties in Ellicott City and additionally over 1000 properties countywide will benefit from this expedited process for minor alterations, as well as the Historic Preservation Commission to help manage the volume of requests.""

Weekend Warrior Snack Pack Program
In 2017, the Food Access Committee of Howard County, comprised of representatives from the Howard County Office of Community Sustainability, Howard County Office of Community Resources and Services, Howard County Library System, Howard County Public Schools, Community Action Council, Howard County Department of Recreation and Parks, and Local Children's Board recognized a gap in food access services for children during the summer months when school is not in session. The Weekend Warrior Snack Pack Program was created to provide healthy, nutritional food for food insecure children on the weekends during the summer months. Each snack pack includes enough food for one child for the weekend. The food for the snack packs has been selected with the assistance of a nutritionist and is ready to eat or microwavable for easy consumption.

Since 2017, 6,273 snack packs have been distributed across five locations in Howard County with numbers increasing each year (2017-2019). In 2019, nearly 1,200 children participated in the program. The program is administered by utilizing the existing infrastructure of the Howard County Roving Radish program, which is managed by the office of community sustainability and already has the equipment and space to prepare and deliver food to residents. The Weekend Warrior Snack Pack Program has made a positive impact on the community and children of Howard County.

""We're honored to receive this recognition from the National Association of Counties for our ongoing commitment to increasing food access for communities throughout Howard County,"" said Jacqueline R. Scott, director of the department of community resources and services. ""The summer can be a difficult time for families seeking to maintain consistent, healthy eating options for children without the support of meals provided during school hours. We appreciate the work of our interagency partner, the Roving Radish and the support of county administration for making health and wellness a priority through the work of this important initiative.""

Howard County Turf to Trees and Trees Giveaway
The department of recreation and parks and the office of community sustainability work closely together to promote more tree planting in Howard County. Turf to Trees is a program that increases overall tree canopy by working with residents to plant trees on private property. Since 2015, Turf to Trees has planted 6,766 trees on approximately 34 acres of land.

To get even more trees planted, Howard County held a Tree Giveaway event in October 2019 when 2,000 trees were planted and county staff interacted with residents by email and on the tree pickup days, adding to a positive impression of county government and increasing our efforts to combat climate change.

""Both Turf to Trees and Weekend Warrior Snack Packs are great examples of intragovernmental partnerships. In each case departments ignored traditional silos in order to work together to achieve common good,"" said Josh Feldmark, director of the office of community sustainability. ""They are ideal models for good government.""

Howard County Mental Health Program
Howard County Police Department's mental health section was established in 2018 as a proactive move as departments across the country saw increases in calls for service with mental health components. The section, which falls under our community outreach division, includes a supervisor, two officers and a civilian licensed clinical professional counselor, and assists community members in crisis navigate available resources. Members of the section provide direct outreach to persons in crisis and ensure follow-up services are offered to those who undergo an emergency petition, more than 1,200 annually in Howard County. The mental health section also educates fellow officers and community partners on how to better serve those in crisis.

""The recognition for HCPD's Mental Health Section from NACo truly calls attention to their compassionate, effective efforts in assisting community members experiencing mental health challenges navigate the resources available to them,"" said Chief Lisa Myers.

Nationally, awards are given in 18 different categories that reflect the vast, comprehensive services counties provide. The categories include children and youth, criminal justice and public safety, county administration, information technology, health, civic engagement and many more. In 2019, Howard County received seven Achievement Awards from NACo."

""As a County Executive, and as a father, I am frustrated with the clear inequity that continues to exist in our society,"" Ball said. ""It is easy to identify the problems and causes, but the part that eternally eludes us is the solution.""
He called upon the community to continue the dialogue about race.
""As a county that prides itself on inclusion and civility, it remains our responsibility to collaborate, encourage and create an open dialogue to improve race-relations and institute changes that improve the quality of life for not only current, but future generations,"" Ball said.
He commended Hoco For Justice, the youth group that led the march, which began outside The Mall in Columbia and continued to Lake Kittamaqundi.
""Now, it is more important than ever that residents have the opportunity for their voices to be heard, the freedom to peacefully protest and organize, and the ability to demand we do better as a community,"" Ball said. ""Change will only come locally if we work to encourage our friends and neighbors to do the same.""
He continued: ""I stand firm with our community and every person working to build a better future in Howard County, the State of Maryland, and in our country.""

Bringing Vincent Home, by Madeleine Mysko* (Plain View Press, 2007, 182 pages, $14.95) Local author.
Divided Nations, Divided Families
The Viet Nam Conflict of the 60s and 70s divided the nations of both Viet Nam and the United States as well as dividing many families: the one depicted in Bringing Vincent Home is no exception. The (fictional) Duvalls of Baltimore represent us all: they are a microcosm of our county during that era, superimposed on a highly individualized story of one soldier, wounded in action. The Duvalls represent those who are single mothers in the 50s and 60s, war protestors, writers for the Baltimore Sun, pre-med majors, good Catholics, athletes, nurses and nurses in training, doctors, burn victims, and, of course, soldiers.
Lyrical, Melodic, Comforting and Immensely Likable!
Author Madeleine Mysko's prose is easy-going with nearly all the characters interconnected in a natural relaxing way. You will not be surprised to learn that she is also a poet in addition to being a novelist. Amazingly, the reader learns the backstory of the many major characters that travel tin and out through the novel, amid the heat of San Antonio's Army base with Brooke Army Medical Center (Bamcee). And yet, the minor stories set the stage, and the soldiers and Army nurses are real and likable, and, of course, inspiring yet human.
Bringing Vincent Home is perhaps the only book I have reviewed in the past eight years online (and longer, in print) without chapter titles, which seemed quite appropriate. I often play the game of creating my own chapter titles if they are not provided but the Vincent book was perfect with chapters being numbered only. Many began with a page or so of reminiscing back to Vincent's childhood times before focusing on the here and now of 1968 San Antonio, Texas, of a military base, of a hospital. There is so much growing-up to do before ""bringing Vincent home,"" even by his mother.
The Plot
The reader does not know if Vincent will survive the painful daily burn treatments (debridements) and the surgical grafts he must undergo. The reader does not know if Vincent's mother will have to return to Baltimore to wait for her son's transfer to t he VA hospital system or if she will return alone to grieve.
Some will think the story ends rather abruptly but not all readers will agree. Sometimes we each have to finish the story in our own way. However, the author has given us an epilogue, which was not necessary - but neither was it surprising in how the lives of the numerous main characters turned out – the sign of a well-thought out story.
Bringing Vincent Home is a book I will take down from my bookshelf at least once a year to read again.

No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy SEAL, The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden, by Mark Owen (pen name) with Kevin Maurer (Dutton/Penguin, 2012, 316 pages, $26.95) A USA Today's number one best-seller.
No Easy Day was reviewed in the immediately preceding blog: this blog continues reviewing the book as read by a group of military veterans in Columbia, Maryland – a Veterans Book Group* (VBG).
The VBG met in a Zoom meeting during COVID-19, which was quite successful. (It seems the country is learning how to communicate by Zoom with fewer and fewer glitches.) In addition, the group came to a consensus on the major points depicted: this is always comforting to the individuals involved.
For example, authors Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer may have mistitled their book in that they lead one to believe the book is primarily about the Osama bin Laden (UBL) raid (white it comprised only the final third of more than 300 pages). The group agreed Owen wrote a memoir of his life, emphasizing his entire Navy SEAL career including his training and previous deployments which merely culminated in the bin Laden take-down. Although we agreed the entire story was simply fascinating, the sub-title of The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden implies that more than just a third would be devoted to that mission.
Of course, this reviewer, being a dog trainer and Afghanistan veteran, knew the entire story of the raid and hoped for more information about Cairo, the dog who took part in the mission and whose photo has appeared everywhere.
As stated in the previous blog review, several military weapons were mentioned with no glossary (but the detailed graphics of the raid were exemplary). One veteran ended up 'googling' many of these weapons (that he mistakenly called guns) while others just glossed over them as non-veterans probably did as well.
Who Should Read No Easy Day
The book group leader suggested No Easy Day might be a good candidate for required reading by all military leaders – it follows one enlisted man's career in a highly-specialized and highly-trained career path and implies modern leadership's indecisions and micromanagement. This practice was begun during the Vietnam Conflict when commanders flew in helicopters above small battles and gave orders to the lieutenants on the ground: we felt that those on the ground had been well-trained and should be left to do their jobs. After all, they are the pro's. This group of SEALs had been well-trained for this mission and yet had to wait several days for the go-ahead from the president who then watched the mission unfold as it was happening!
Death on Your Shoulder
As the only combat-zone veteran in the group, I was asked about the concept of 'death on your shoulder' which author Owen implies right from the beginning. I remarked on the extensive planning the military provides for deploying soldiers, from having them make out wills to educating them on the event of their being taken prisoner and what will be done behind the scenes to rescue them. Therefore, prior to my deployment, I was aware I might not return but it was not a major concern for me.
Work Hard, Play Hard
Another theme in No Easy Day concerns the ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" experience of specialized troops. They spend many overtime hours together and must learn to trust each other. They become a family, a unit of one. Perhaps a third of their time is spent training and planning, another third (though a smaller third) is spent carrying out the mission, and the third third on leave with their families. These men have two families and when they are with their actual family, the military is always on their mind. When they are with their military unit, there is no time to think of their actual family – so planning and trust play a major part once again.
The CIA Agent
And finally, one veteran spoke of the emotional CIA agent after the mission was complete. I explained she was an academic, a collage graduate, and had just spent five years trying to locate UBL - this was the cessation of that part of her job. In addition, she was a desk analyst not a soldier so she had not been exposed to military casualties and may not yet have experienced death in her young life.
All in all, our group felt No Easy Day might become a recruitment tool for special forces even for those who, in 10 years, will not know much about the Battle for Bin Laden. Leadership will also gain from reading this book.
And so will you!

The guidelines take effect Friday at 5 p.m.
""HoCo RISE provides additional data points that are specific to Howard County, our hospital and our infrastructure to combat COVID-19,"" said Ball in a statement. ""We're a data-informed, people-driven community and this framework will allow us to make thoughtful decisions about how to responsibly reopen.""
However, Ball said there are concerns about the county's proximity to other counties with higher case rates and the county's ability to access testing reagents.
""The governor's announcement came as a bit of surprise. We did not expect him to go as far as he did, especially in areas like religious gatherings,"" said Ball. ""We recognize the significant burden our residents, workers and businesses have faced over the past six weeks. This week, another 3,199 residents filed for unemployment insurance and pandemic unemployment assistance, bringing Howard County's total unemployment claims to more than 26,000. We are still working toward many of the building blocks needed for additional reopening, but we feel as though some limited retail and outdoor activities can resume safely at this time.""
Hoard County Executive Ball has made the following decisions for each of the governor's Step One actions:
* Howard County did not implement a county-wide stay-at-home order and one will not be implemented at this time. Residents are encouraged to stay at home as much as possible and abide by the governor's safer-at-home public health advisory.
* Religious Services - Howard County in-person religious gatherings may resume with 10 people or less and are strongly encouraged to take place in outdoor settings.
* Retail - The following is a non-exhaustive list of Howard County retail businesses that may open but are restricted to curbside pick-up or delivery only:
* The following retail establishments may operate at 50 percent capacity:
* Howard County manufacturing businesses may open following the guidelines issued by the State of Maryland.
* Howard County barber shops and hair salons may open by appointment only with only one customer allowed in a location at a time. Businesses should follow guidelines issued by the State of Maryland.
* The Governor's Step One reopening does not include nail salons, esthetician services or massage parlors.
* Howard County outdoor archery and shooting ranges may open with appropriate physical distancing and mask requirements.
* Howard County campgrounds will remain closed.
* Howard County Recreation & Parks boat rentals will remain closed. Columbia Association's boat rentals will remain closed.
* Howard County horse boarding and riding facilities may open with appropriate physical distancing and mask requirements.
* Mall in Columbia stores with exterior access may open for curbside pick-up or delivery only."

(The Howard County, Maryland, public library system has six copies)
What's With The Title?
Why call a book, No Easy Day? Because the book is about Navy SEALs (SEa, Air, and Land tactically proficient) who are trained and deployed to areas needing their skills in unconventional warfare. Their philosophy is ""The only easy day was yesterday.""
No Easy Day begins with the selection and training of SEALs, and a few sample deployments of the author, Mark Owen, the son of Alaskan ministers who, at age 13, decided to become a SEAL. His father talked him into one year of college which turned into four: a college degree would have qualified Owen to become an officer, but an officer's life is less tactical and more dictated not only by subordinates but also by superiors and paperwork.
All kinds of war books and stories have been written over the years: histories, memoirs, personal accounts, strategic and tactical texts. Some are ""boy books"" full of action and weapons and battles. Some are, at the expense of my being called sexist, ""girl books"" that document how war affects people and the daily life of civilians affected by war. Some are military books, full of specific terms that veterans understand but, without a glossary, are lost on those who have never been in the military.
No Easy Day, No Easy Read
Because of the sensitive nature of SEAL teamwork, we don't learn much about the non-SEAL life of the author: don't know if he is married, e.g. (though I suspect he is not). And the introduction, though necessary, takes up nearly half the book but will be engaging for many readers - not this reviewer, however – I felt it too detailed in some places with not enough detail in others. The writing style was simply neither 'magic' nor enthralling. Not an easy read but a fast one.
A Warning (of Sorts)
Do not start the last half of the book late at night if you have to go to work the next day. You may just stay up all night to finish it!
The authors take you through the intensive planning and training, and subsequent waiting for approval from the President for the mission to get Osama bin Laden (once his location had been identified), then you join the two dozen troops through infiltration, assault and exfiltration with the target. You will hold your breath through the snafu's that go wrong and come out the other side with the upmost respect for these men, type A's all (perfectionists), who train almost more than they work and who really live as a brotherhood of men.
The Controversy
Military members in certain job specialties must send their books and resumes through a governmental review process. Mark Owen did not do this, which sparked a legal controversy: the author denied revealing any classified information but the Department of Defense (DoD) refuted that. After Owen ended up suing his attorney, he forfeited millions of dollars, agreed to turn his royalties over to the DoD and lost his security clearance and all future movie rights* - and also suffered damage to his reputation. This story was still in the news five years later.

By Horus Alas

September 8, 2020
Howard County Councilmember Liz Walsh (D) has prefiled legislation to end the county's 25-year contract with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Her bill will be formally introduced Tuesday, and has support right now from three of the county council's five members.
The agreement has allowed ICE to house immigrants facing deportation orders at the Howard County Detention Center in Jessup. ICE currently pays the county $110 per individual housed at the detention center per day.
Walsh said that a series of protests against the contract and salient media coverage over the summer convinced her to bring a bill forward when the county council reconvenes this month after an August recess.

She cited, ""consistent, new organized protests… coalescing against this single issue."" And in reference to a recent Maryland Matters story recounting the experiences of four men who were in ICE detention at Jessup, Walsh said, ""I thought your story was so important because it humanized the process. We see the data and national research, but pieces like yours give a human story to what's wrong with the system.""
County Councilmember Deb Jung (D) had spoken at a protest against the ICE contract organized by CASA and the Howard County Coalition for Immigrant Justice this June. She confirmed her support for Walsh's bill in a recent email to Maryland Matters.
""Howard County's contract with ICE, which adds people to our prison population during a pandemic, is unwise and uncalled for,"" she wrote. According to Jung, the contract, ""can be terminated at any time, and now is the time.""
An aide for Christiana Rigby — another Democratic councilmember — wrote in an email statement to Maryland Matters that she also planned to vote in favor of ending the ICE contract.
Walsh said that with tentative support from a majority of the county council, she hoped Democratic County Executive Calvin Ball would sign the bill. ""He has the opportunity to walk away from this arrangement right away,"" she said.
Jack Kavanagh, the director of Howard County's Department of Corrections, told Maryland Matters that he was not personally opposed to ending the contract, and instead took issue with allegations that the detention center does not provide adequate care for inmates.
""My objections have always been about the misstatements about who we house here and the conditions they're in,"" Kavanagh said. Cancellation of the contract is ""the decision of Executive Ball, and I'll accept it however it plays out… My objection is allegations that we aren't doing things right.""
Walsh also said she hoped for support from state lawmakers representing Howard County, some of whom may have backed a measure from Del. Vaughn Stewart (D), the Dignity Not Detention Act, in the 2020 legislative session, which would have outlawed government partnerships with ICE statewide.
Stewart's bill did not advance to a vote because this year's General Assembly session was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite that, he told Maryland Matters, ""I think my statewide bill is going to pass next session. Howard County and Frederick have a few months left if they want to eliminate [their ICE contracts].""
Stewart said that ideally, local jurisdictions would cancel their existing contracts with ICE, while his bill would prevent new ones from being signed at the state level. ""If I were on the Howard County council, I would want to take the high road and be on the right side of this,"" he said.
For some members of the immigrant community, Walsh's legislation is a resounding victory for their efforts.
""I am so happy!"" Maria Rivas — a CASA member whose brother was detained at Jessup — said. ""This legislation will make sure nobody else has to suffer without just cause, like my brother who was detained for five months did. We will continue to work every day until we pass this legislation.""

24,/maryland/columbia/md-ban-plastic-foam-food-containers-starts-oct-1,2020-09-28T16:52:07Z,MD Ban On Plastic Foam Food Containers Starts...,4,8,Deb Belt,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — Takeout food service will never be the same after this week in Maryland when a ban on plastic foam cups and food containers takes effect. Implementation of the ban was delayed from July 1 to Oct. 1 to let businesses gear up while dealing with coronavirus restrictions.
Proponents say the ban will protect the environment and keep plastic foam out of area waterways and landfills.
Maryland is the first state in the country to prohibit use of foam containers, the Baltimore Sun reported. With restaurant use shifting largely to takeout in recent months, the amount trash generated has soared nationwide, jumping 22 percent in Baltimore, the newspaper said.
The polystyrene ban became law without Gov. Larry Hogan's signature.
The 2019 legislative session the Maryland General Assembly banned the use of food service products composed of expanded polystyrene, commonly referred to under the trademark name of Styrofoam.
Cups, plates, bowls, trays and other food service packaging can no longer be kept in plastic foam after Thursday.
County health or environmental departments will enforce the law; a maximum fine of $250 can be imposed on a person or food service business violating the law. A written notice of violation must first be issued, and the violator has three months to comply.
Several counties and the city of Baltimore had already banned the use of containers made from polystyrene foam. Baltimore's plastic foam container ban includes everything from foam to-go boxes to trays, cups and bowls. Fines start at $200.
Annapolis banned the use of the product starting Sept. 1, 2019. Violators who sell or use foam packaging are fined $100 for the first offense and $200 for subsequent violations.

October 6, 2020
In a 3-2 vote, the Howard County Council Monday night passed legislation that would end the county's 25-year contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But within the hour, County Executive Calvin Ball (D) announced he would veto the bill.
The legislation — known as CB51-2020 — was introduced by Councilmember Liz Walsh (D) in September. She cited a burgeoning series of protests against the contract over the summer as impetus to put a bill forward, and voted in favor of it Monday.
The long-standing contract allows ICE to house immigrants facing deportation at the Howard County Detention Center in Jessup for $110 per individual per day.
Councilmembers Deb Jung (D) and Christiana Rigby (D) had previously confirmed to Maryland Matters that they supported the bill. Their votes in favor allowed it to pass Monday night.
But minutes after the council vote, Ball issued a statement in which he touted his reworked contract policy — whereby only violent convicted offenders can be housed by ICE at the county detention center.
He said the new policy ""provided a practical long-term solution"" for the county's immigrant population, and argued that CB-51 would end a contract that made the state and county safer, while making it harder for detainees to ""receive proper legal representation and access to their families.""
Councilmember Opel Jones (D) voted against the measure, saying in a statement that it didn't sufficiently address where detainees in Howard County would be transferred to if the Jessup facility were no longer housing them. Jones' statement quoted University of Maryland School of Law professor Maureen Sweeney.
If the contract were cancelled, ""'There is no guarantee [ICE detainees] will be held in Maryland,'"" Jones' statement read. ""'They could end up far from support networks of family and friends in rural detention centers in Georgia, Virginia, Louisiana, or North Carolina, with some of the worst reputations in the country for unsanitary, unsafe, and abusive conditions.'""
In addition to Howard, Worcester and Frederick counties also have contracts with ICE which allow them to house immigrants at their detention centers. Howard County does not participate in the 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to collaborate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.
David Yungmann — the only Republican serving on the county council — also cast a vote against CB-51.
While some immigration activists initially voiced support for Ball's policy directive — CASA Executive Director Gustavo Torres said when it was announced that it indicated that, ""everybody, regardless of immigration status — [is] welcome here,"" others weren't so readily convinced.
Leslie Salgado, chair of the Howard County-based group Friends of Latin America, criticized Ball's policy for preserving the county's relationship with an organization that she said criminalizes Latinos.
""Folks who have committed crimes have already gone through the regular justice system,"" she told Maryland Matters last week. Salgado said that a deportation order on top of a punitive jail sentence is not something a U.S. citizen would face, and that, ""What we in the coalition are objecting to is the relationship between Howard County and this agency that violates human rights.""
During a news conference Friday, Walsh criticized Ball's policy change on the grounds that it, ""won't stop harm to the family of the person detained. It does nothing to change ICE's actions, but only modifies them slightly.""
Torres clarified his stance during the same news conference, saying that while he found Ball's policy ""a step in the right direction… We hope the county council and executive come together and sign CB-51. We find it totally unacceptable how people are detained.""
Immediately before the county's legislative session began, immigrants' rights activists gathered outside the George Howard Building in Ellicott City for a candlelight vigil aimed at swaying the county council to back Walsh's bill.
During the event, CASA member Laura Arroyo — who said she has lived in Howard County for 14 years — said her husband had been deported from the county. ""I thank you all for being here and supporting us as immigrants,"" Arroyo said in Spanish.
Maria Rivas, whose brother spent about five months detained at Jessup, urged the council to pass CB-51, saying, ""We have the right to not be treated as criminals. We do not represent a danger to our communities.""
The county council's next move on CB-51 with a pending veto from Ball remains up in the air. But CASA immediately celebrated its passage last night, writing on Twitter that, ""Howard County has long been recognized as a place where diversity is embraced and celebrated. Today, we can say we are one step closer to living this truth because of [Walsh].""

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Better long-term planning and open communication with HCPSS stakeholders:
The burden of educating our children falls on all of us. We pay taxes in various ways as active members of our community and we all should be engaged to support a healthy school system. There needs to be open communication with more fluid and long-term planning between HCPSS stakeholders and the County Council when considering approving new residential development on many layers of the infrastructure outcomes (e.g., not only school construction and renovations, but also transportation impacts). These have to be honest conversations on strategy of balancing the needs for development and the needs of the school system to handle the growth of population and enrollment as a result of development.
Educational Equity:
Educational Equity is the identification of and compensation for areas that create barriers to opportunity and success in education for students. The barriers of an individual student vary across all students but there are some specific demographic characteristics that have been identified to be educational barriers. A student's socioeconomic status, disability, race, gender and language are some examples of areas where students may require additional support for academic success. HCPSS supports these specific areas through identified programming. I believe funding should be budgeted based on a school's demographic characteristics, not just enrollment. Students should be provided support through staffing, supplies and services from Black Student Achievement Program, Hispanic Achievement Program, International Student and Family Services, as well as MESA. Feedback from students, families, and staff providing these services should be welcome and program offerings should be budgeted to support educational equity for the students. These programs should be reporting the graduation rates as well as any other feedback for the program.
Improvements to Special Education Services:
Special Education covers many types of students in HCPSS. Student supports include a broad age range and a set of diverse needs. The school system has implemented least restrictive inclusive environments for students all the way to full-time residential needs. The students should be the center of focus in their education and school should be staffed in an adequate and transparent methodology that has goals and open communication between the school system, educators, providers, students and parents. The school system should invest in training providers to best support students' needs while maintaining workable caseloads within monitored guidelines. Early intervention should be emphasized through various routes so that children can work to their best abilities always instead of having to fall behind to catch up. School buildings, buses and playgrounds should allow all abilities to be included and supported at all times. Despite their best efforts, HCPSS should make improvements to serve the needs of the special education community.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Black Lives Matter. We need to change our school disciplinary practices so that we build a school culture where relationships are important, where we listen and value others, where we own and repair the harms we have done to others, and where everyone is valued, included and accepted.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
The reexamining of the SRO program has been long needed for our school system. The intention and the implementation need to be examined and the program changed. There are currently SROs in every high school and in a few of our middle schools. When reviewing the arrest and suspension data from our schools, we know that Black and brown students as well as special education students are disproportionately impacted compared to their peers. We also can see from the data that the SROs are placed in middle schools that have higher than county average Black and brown student demographic populations.
Current students and HCPSS alumni have reflected and shared their interactions with not only the officers but with adults in the building that show bias towards them. I think in this revision of the SRO program, we should not have armed police in our schools during the day. We should continue to build community with our police department through community engagement where the pressure of a students learning isn't in the equation. We need to work on our school culture so that every student, educator and staff are valued, included, and accepted.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
The board of education voted to have the school 100% virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic that is currently impacting our entire world. The school system closed for a couple of weeks in March and came to the understanding that they were not able to re-open safely at that time. The school system, within a few weeks, created a continuity of learning plan to work through to the summer. At the same time, the school system began its longer term planning for virtual learning.
The school system purchased Chromebooks to move closer to a 1 to 1 ratio — an investment that was long overdue. Currently, the virtual learning is 100% for the first semester and the school system has also implemented a 4X4 schedule for MS and HS students. I agree that this was the best course of action for prioritizing the health and safety of everyone involved in our school community and reducing the risk of COVID infection. I would like to see specifics on what the school system considers the best hybrid model and how the health and safety is going to be evaluated and enforced before knowing if the plan is a good one or not. They are also working on plans for small groups to return. I have worked in the healthcare field for several years now and I know from experience that it can take a while to gain a full understanding of it means to provide safety and healthy standards and that it can also change over time.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
My opponent Tom, has thrown his full support behind me and we hope to work with a united district in supporting our school system, despite his name still appearing on the ballot. My hope is to encourage you to vote and to show how I can work for the community through collaboration.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
For many in our community it is no surprise that I finally decided to run for board of education in District 3 given how active I have been over the last 13 years. I have supported public education by representing my children's schools in HCPSM, GT Parent Academy, PTA volunteering, chaperoning field trips, as well as helping in the classrooms. I have supported the BoE through being a General Community member on the Policy Review Committee, member and vice chair for CAC and a representative on OBRC.
I am running:
1. I realized that District 3 has been historically underrepresented on the board and needed a strong voice of an engaged HCPSS parent and active community advocate.
2. I believe my professional background as a data scientist will be a tremendous asset. I will bring evidence-based decision making that is thoughtful and well-reasoned combined with vast K-12 school system experience as an HCPSS parent to the board.
3. My life experiences as a parent with GT and special needs children, my experience of having a child who survived cancer, my experiences of having four children who range from 4 to 17 years old all give me a unique perspective from which to advocate for all children.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

I would like to see a review of the overall school system with a goal of identifying pain points the system has been dealing with and access the root causes of these symptoms. These root causes will then be analyzed and steps prioritized to repair these issues as well as minimize unintended consequences. The board should create policies to support funding formulas towards school demographic-based needs. More specifically, the policies should identify and implement funding formulas, not just on overall enrollment projections, but specific to programs that target more vulnerable populations so that these programs are supported and the students are graduating with success.
I would like to see diversity, inclusion, and tolerance initiatives prioritized. This should include changes in policy for the inclusion of new diverse materials in classroom teaching. This will align with training and workshops for whole-school culture building that welcomes inclusion, diversity and tolerance. The purpose of this policy would be to approve more diverse materials for curriculum and also fund the materials and time to incorporate them into the curriculum taught at all of the schools.

Why should voters trust you?

I encourage voters to reach out to me and we can build our relationship and trust. My goals are to support a healthy school system where our school culture so that every student, educator and staff are valued, included, and accepted.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

The school system's financial situation is far from ideal and the school system is still trying to recover from previous board of education budget decisions, county-level decisions, as well as trying to support a growing student enrollment. Everyone also has the current and future impact of COVID-19 ramifications to consider as well. The superintendent/board of education is faced with balancing not only what they feel the school system requires to maintain its current level of services, but also to repair past debts. This has forced the school system to prioritize some areas and cut other areas, which is extremely difficult because these changes usually occur in instructional areas or programs; directly impacting the classroom.
I would like to work on policy that focuses on extinguishing root causes of inequities, policy to support funding formulas specific to a school's demographic based needs, and policy on school climate with the goal to encourage inclusion and tolerance. Educational Equity is achieved by identifying and compensating for areas that create barriers to opportunity and success in education for students. The barriers of an individual student vary across the student population but there are some specific demographic characteristics that have been identified to be educational barriers. A student's socioeconomic status, disability, race, gender and language are some examples of areas where students may require additional support for academic success.
CPSS supports these specific areas through identified programming. I believe funding should be budgeted based on a school's demographic characteristics, not just enrollment. Students should be provided support through staffing, supplies and services from Black Student Achievement Program, Hispanic Achievement Program, International Student and Family Services, as well as MESA. Feedback from students, families, and staff providing these services should be welcome and program offerings should be budgeted to support educational equity for the students. These programs should be reporting the graduation rates as well as any other feedback for the program.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

I cannot think of any reason other than those listed that I would not serve full term.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
There are two phrases I learned from two 7-year-old children who were battling cancer that have stuck with me when I look towards the future. ""Without hope there is no hope"" and ""I thought I was Strong. I thought I was Brave. I thought I was Scared but I did it anyway."""

But a growing number of states and cities are marking the day as Indigenous Peoples Day, a day that recognizes Native Americans instead.
""On our first observance of Indigenous Peoples' day in Howard County, we hope it opens up discussions on the importance of acknowledging our history throughout our government and our community,"" said Howard County County Executive Calvin Ball in a statement. ""Indigenous and Native American history is embedded in our nomenclature and our geography – Patuxent, Potomac, Kittamaqundi - and there is a clear opportunity for our residents of all ages to learn more about the people who lived on this land before us. I encourage our residents to use this day to reflect and learn more about the native lands that we live on, there is a deep history of erasing these stories and part of our goal is to amplify and share the stories of Native people.""
""Indigenous Peoples' Day brings awareness to the First People of this nation that often are invisible to many,"" added Kevin Allis, CEO for the National Congress of the American Indian. ""It's a day that celebrates the beauty of the American Indian, and is a reminder to all that tribal nations, and their traditions and customs, still exist.""
In Howard County, there is a long tradition of honoring Native Americans and those who lived on these lands before us. The Howard County Historical Society noted that based on archeology, evidence of Native American settlement in the Howard County region suggests that the earliest settlers were here 12,000 years ago. Algonquin speaking peoples used these lands that we call home as hunting grounds prior to European colonization in the 1600's.
The county is surrounded by remnants of that Algonquin past by our natural landmarks; the Patapsco River derives from the Algonquin meaning ""Backriver"" while the Patuxent River was named by famed explorer John Smith after the Patuxent people who lived along its banks. Lake Kittamaqundi (loosely translated into ""A Friendly Meeting Place"") in Columbia was named by The Rouse Company in 1966 to honor the Algonquin Piscataway peoples who lived along the Southern border of the County into Prince George's County and further points south.
The Quaker Ellicott family, known for their ingenuity and enterprise were also strong advocates of education and often invited Native Americans from tribes across the United States to come to Ellicott Mills and engage, interact and learn in one of their Quaker Schools. Members of the Chickasaw, Crow, Miami, Beaver, Delawares, Shawanese, and Potowatomie Tribes were known to have visited Ellicott Mills from the late 1700s to the early 1800s. With the increased settlement in the region, Native Americans in Howard County were left with similar choices that thousands of other tribes would be forced to make - assimilate into an American way of life or be displaced from their ancestral lands.
""Indigenous Peoples' Day is about acknowledging the First People, the Treaty People, of the land we now call home,"" said Ani Begay, Navajo Nation representative. ""It is a first step in honestly addressing the legacies and costs of our prosperity, both imparted unevenly to this day. We do not get to choose our past, but we get to choose our values: How we live up to and celebrate them. This moment in history is our opportunity to choose, with the clarity of historical perspective as to the true measure of those long celebrated as heroes, to celebrate legacies that represent our values. Today, Howard County's choice is local. Today we choose Civility and Indigeneity.""
In Columbia, Monday is Indigenous Peoples Day. Howard County government offices, courts, animal shelter, 50+ centers and Robinson Nature Center will be closed in observance of the Indigenous Peoples' Day holiday Oct. 12. However, regular trash, recycling, yard trim and food scrap services will be in effect and the Alpha Ridge Landfill will be open. County parks, the Gary J. Arthur, North Laurel and Roger Carter Community Centers, county historic sites and the Meadowbrook Athletic Center will be open on Oct. 12. The Cedar Lane and Schooley Mill Activity Rooms will be open, but by permit only.
The Regional Transportation Agency (RTA) will operate on a regular weekday schedule. For more information on RTA, call 1-800-270-9553 or visit www.transitrta.com. All parking regulations and fees will be in effect on Indigenous Peoples' Day. The 9-1-1 Center, police and fire departments will be staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For emergencies, call 9-1-1. For non-emergencies, please call 410-313-2200.
The holiday in 2020 comes as the decades-long debate and controversy over Native American sports team names continues. Earlier this year, the NFL team in Washington, D.C., dropped their Redskins nickname and are now simply called the Washington Football Team. The Cleveland Indians are also considering changing their name for the first time since 1915, according to reports.
Columbus Day celebrations date back to the 18th century in some places, according to the History Channel, but did not become a federal holiday for celebration on the second Monday of October until 1971. The day continues to be listed by the federal government as Columbus Day.
Indigenous Peoples Day — seen by its promoters as a day of reckoning for centuries of systemic bias against native populations — is a more recent phenomenon.
South Dakota was the first state to recognize ""Native Americans Day"" in 1990, and the city of Berkeley, California, declared the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples Day in 1992. Hundreds of municipalities have followed during the past decade.
The debate continues elsewhere.
In Chicago, which hosts one of the largest yearly Columbus Day parades, there's been a push to make a change. Chicago Public Schools earlier this year announced it is ditching Columbus Day in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day. But the city as a whole still represents the holiday honoring Italian Americans.
The controversy is centered on facts that show Columbus was far from the first person to ""discover"" the Americas, did not land in the United States and was involved in the slaughter of Native Americans after he did arrive.
Earlier this year, protesters attempted to destroy the statue of Columbus in Chicago's Arrigo Park, where the city's annual October parade concludes. The city later had it removed.
Large Columbus Day parades are held in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, among other major American cities. All of these have been canceled in their traditional form for 2020 due to the coronavirus, however.
Evanston, one of Chicago's largest suburbs and home to Northwestern University, made the switch from Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day in 2016.
Bernie Pratt, a First Nations (name given to Native Americans born in Canada) resident, applauded the suburb's move.
""When Columbus came ashore, he was diseased and infected with parasites,"" Pratt told Patch after the city's decision. ""He was starving, and wasn't going to last more than a couple of days. He shouldn't be acknowledged for being lost.""
But Louis Rago, president of the Italian American Human Relations Foundation of Chicago, was among those against the move.
""I don't understand why it (Indigenous Peoples Day) has to fall on Columbus Day,"" Rago told Patch. ""There are so many other days …. There's a group of people that feel that whatever good came from Columbus landing on the shores of the Americas, all the evil that's happened since 1492 is his fault.""
As of 2019, at least eight states, 10 universities and more than 130 cities observe Indigenous Peoples Day, according to a USA Today report. Several states, such as Louisiana and Wisconsin, made the change just last year."

Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man, by Mary Trump, PhD (Simon & Schuster, 225 pages, 2020, $28.00)
A Short Bestseller, A Literary Soap Opera?
Too Much and Never Enough – a complex title for a short book (225 pages) about a dysfunctional New York City family that made the top of the New York Times Bestseller List (the book, not the family - certainly not the family).
However, the family may be one of the most powerful and wealthy in the country for over half a century and one which nearly every American follows voraciously each day. Some even wake up in the morning wondering what the news of the family (and especially its 'leader') will be to stretch the imagination that day.
Popular books are sometimes written by famous (or infamous) people or about well-known events (911, e.g.) or both. This is one such book for both reasons.
Other popular books have an engrossing plot or are extremely well-written. Although Too Much is well-written, it could have used more substantive editing: chapter titles might have had the years associated with them, but then, the prose would have to be written chronologically rather than skipping around. Secondly, the writer is biased which is quite evident. However, we feel we know the characters already and want to know more about them.
Author Mary Trump, our president's niece, holds a doctorate in psychology which is quite apparent. Her writing style attempts to reach the average reader, but still it is obvious that she holds an advanced degree as well as considerable work and teaching experience in aberrant behavior: she describes her family through the eyes of one who has seen much more deviant behavior.
The average writer, however, would probably merely describe the strange family events rather than comment on them with numerous adjectives, comparing her uncle (and the rest of the family) in not-so-glowing terms that border on psychological deviance.
And the author herself, born into extreme wealth, came to expect her share of her grandfather's fortune, merely by virtue of her birth.
The author has been interviewed considerably, especially about her uncle's paying a friend to take an entrance exam for him and for her own legal court suit to gain the inheritance which she felt was her birthright – not only because it was monetary but also because the family equates money with love.
This reviewer read this book quickly (and it ends rather abruptly) and then went back and re-read the beginning.
And the most revealing and disappointing news concerned how the author's aunt Maryanne obtained her judgeship and how she changed her mind about her brother.
If you don't follow the daily antics of this family, you will remain glued to the pages, just like a soap opera!
Caveat: This book was purchased for review."

Judge, Circuit Court for Howard County
The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The most pressing issue facing our court is the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations. Cases have been delayed and we in the Circuit Court for Howard County are working diligently to reduce the backlog and ensure equal justice for all. We have taken numerous and extensive actions to conduct operations safely, including the resumption of jury trials.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Bias and prejudice should hold no place in the criminal justice system. The Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that judges abstain from public comment on proceedings and issues which may come before the court. The ethics committee has recently issued an opinion stating that judges should not attend protests related to these issues because the independence of the judiciary reasonably may be called into question by doing so. Given these prescriptions, I cannot comment on these issues, because matters related to them may come before the court.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
This nonpartisan judicial election is really about what is in the best interest of Howard County. Voters must decide who they want to make their most important personal legal decisions—those concerning their families, property, contracts, businesses and legal rights. I am the vetted, experienced sitting judge and have made thousands of decisions on the bench. I was chosen following a nonpartisan rigorous selection process involving numerous interviews and extensive background checks. I have the highest possible peer review ratings for legal ability and ethics, placing me in a preeminent position in the legal profession.
I have 35 years experience as a lawyer and judge, including nearly a decade serving in the Maryland Attorney General's Office, where I held responsibility for the most important cases for our state's citizens. I have tried a wide variety of cases in state and federal courts. I am honored to have served with distinction as Judge on the Circuit Court for Howard County for almost two years. Members of the Howard County Bar Association represent real people with real legal problems and are in court every day. These lawyers have overwhelmingly concluded that I am the best qualified candidate for this position, finding that my record for integrity, temperament, and professional competence entitles me to immediate endorsement for election. For additional information, please go to my website johnkuchno.com.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
Independence, integrity and impartiality define my work on the bench and my campaign. I treat everyone with respect in my courtroom and apply the law with integrity and fairness. I am guided by and comply fully with judicial conduct rules that demand judges be free from political influence and political pressure. Judges must not in any manner manifest bias or prejudice.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My demonstrated track record as a fair, impartial and nonpartisan judge is clear. I am grateful for the wide support I have earned from the community and from Howard County's own attorneys who appear in my courtroom representing real people with real legal problems. The Howard County Bar Association overwhelmingly endorses my candidacy. The Maryland State Bar Association, representing 24,000 lawyers in the state, also endorses me. I have worked closely with the current and former Attorneys General of Maryland, Brian Frosh and Doug Gansler, and have their endorsements also. I have been recognized by the Maryland Judiciary and honored to have been selected to be part of the Equal Justice Committee, serving on the Sentencing Subcommittee.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

I would be pleased to continue my work and maintain my reputation for independence, integrity, and impartiality. Serving the people of Howard County is a great honor and I would consider continued service to mark success.

Why should voters trust you?

My demonstrated background and track record as the vetted and experienced sitting judge attest to my character, integrity, temperament, and professional competence. This was clearly demonstrated in a vote among Howard County lawyers. To secure their endorsement, a candidate must get at least 80% of ""best-qualified"" responses from the voting lawyers. I met that exceptional threshold.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

Generally speaking, these are political issues which are outside the scope of comment for a member of the judiciary. Certainly, courts must continue to use taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively, recognizing the public's finite resources.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

None, other than the mandatory retirement age for judges.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
""Respect for the law and respect for all."" These are the words I have followed as a judge on the Circuit Court for Howard County.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I grew up in a diverse working class neighborhood where hard work and treating people with respect were core values that define me to this day. My grandparents were immigrants and my parents dropped out of high school to provide for their families. I have worked hard, attended public schools, and worked my way through college and law school. I was a proud union member. I have never forgotten my roots. I have lived in Howard County for more than 35 years, raised my family here, and volunteered in the community. I humbly ask for your vote to continue serving on the Circuit Court."

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our school board is the coronavirus pandemic and how we continue to educate our students amidst it. I voted in favor of a virtual model along with 6 other of my colleagues because it was the right thing to do for the health and safety of our students and staff. The school system was unprepared with the protections and protocols that are necessary to have face to face instruction. Efforts needed to be focused on developing a robust virtual model, as well as for providing stability and consistency for our families and teachers. Our teachers worked hand in hand with the administration to learn how to deliver effective instruction, to use new tools, to help make sure all of our students had access to technology.
By focusing on science and safety concerns of the pandemic, we worked in the best interests of our students and staff. We know that virtual schooling is challenging for many of our students and families—which is why the administration is working to bring in small groups for in-person instruction as well as developing a hybrid model for presentation to the Board on Oct. 22, 2020.
I will do my homework, do the research, follow the public health guidance, and make decisions that are based on science. I will not capitulate to loud, angry voices. As leaders, we must put the needs of our students and staff ahead of the politics that disregards the science and puts our community's health at risk.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Yes, I support Black Lives Matter.
The demonstrations in Howard County have been peaceful, respectful, and motivating. I have used this time to listen and learn, to work on my personal efforts toward anti-racism. Given that my colleague and chairwoman of the BOE, Mavis Blake Ellis is a relative of Jacob Blake and has spoken out about the anguish that accompanied her cousin's shooting, I am compelled to affirm the racism that many in our community have experienced. It is my hope that we as a community can do better and be better at supporting our Black and Brown students, our Black and Brown educators, and removing systemic racism that exists in our schools.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I have 25 years' worth of experience in education. Whether it was my involvement in special education, being a classroom volunteer, running a PTA, growing a science fair from 30 to 300 students, working on multiple policy review committees, or being the chairperson of the system-wide Community Advisory Council to provide public input to the board of education, I am uniquely qualified.
I have successfully passed two nearly billion-dollar Board of Education budgets which began to address historical deficiencies in special education funding, teacher pay, and a deficit in our health care fund. My education in economics, my professional training in data analytics, and my extensive knowledge in school system policy are critical to being able to get the job done on day one. I have demonstrated the ability to work with local community groups and other local elected officials to make sure our schools are funded and our students are learning. This has earned me numerous endorsements from current and former elected leaders and community organizations.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)
I am a current officeholder and I believe that while we are not perfect, we are operating with the best interests of the students and staff in mind.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
I believe that the school system must address issues around equity, aligning our budget with our values, and empowering our educators. We have seen attacks on public education coming from national leaders as well as local extreme voices that are out of sync with the values of Howard County. Our community has shown our deep and abiding commitment to provide excellent educational opportunities and access for all children. My values, experience, background and backbone make me the leader Howard County schools need today.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I am a highly effective sitting member of the board of education. I chair the policy committee of the board of education. I am a director to the Maryland Association of Boards of Education Legal Services Administration. I worked with my colleagues to ensure a unanimous passage of the school system's first ever equity policy. This critical new framework will shape the work and mission of the school system for years to come and hopefully will begin address the achievement gap with accountability, transparency, and adequate funding.
I have successfully passed two nearly billion-dollar budgets of the school system in the two years I have sat on the Board. I have been part of the efforts to reduce the school system's deficit in the health and dental fund to put us back on firm financial footing. In my two years on the board, I have supported increased funding to special education by 11 percent annually and 10 percent annually despite overall budget growth being under 5 percent.
I have been a chairperson of the Community Advisory Council of the board education, the liaison organization between the board of education and the community at large. During my chairmanship, we were the only community organization to provide representation to every HCPSS policy review committee and to provide consistent, critically important feedback to the board of education.
I have run multiple organizations, with hundreds of participants and volunteers that served the community to include PTAs, Blessings in a Backpack, Parents AT Home in Howard County, and East Columbia Preschool.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

The accomplishment that would make my term in office a success is to provide every child in the Howard County Public School System with access to a high-quality education. I will help develop policies and procedures that contribute to all children receiving a quality education. Specifically, I will work towards:
• Policies and practices that overcome educator and administrator bias
• Reductions of disproportionate suspensions and discipline for Black, Male and Special
Education Students
• Reduce the achievement gap, not by pushing the ceiling down, but by bringing up the
floor. This must include:
--Additional Achievement Liaisons (BSAP, HSAP, International)
--Increased diversified hiring and retention
--Anti-bias training
• Support and fund the acquisition of educational technology so that when we are faced
with a national emergency (like we are experiencing currently with the coronavirus pandemic), we can have viable distance learning options.
• Continue to support our provision of food and mental health services in an emergency,
like we are experiencing now.
• Eliminate the deficit in the health and dental fund that was legacy of previous boards and the former administration that continues to hamstring our innovation and progress to implement effective, new educational programs.

Why should voters trust you?

I do not hide from my values and positions. I work with my colleagues to develop solutions that improve the status quo rather than grandstand. If you watch the board meetings, you will quickly see that I do my homework, I research, I study, I come prepared to discuss and deliberate. I listen to and regularly meet with community groups to hear their concerns and their feedback. I listen to teachers and students. I listen to education experts. I take the time to learn in order to do my job better.
Other elected officials that the board of education works with day in and day out have determined who they trust to work with on the board of education. They trust me and for that reason, I am endorsed by many of these local elected officials and community groups, like Sen. Clarence Lam, MD, Delegate Terri Hill, MD, Delegate Eric Ebersole, Delegate Jessica Feldmark, Africans Americans in Howard County, former County Executive Liz Bobo, and others.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

The school system needs to have a balanced budget and the current deficit in the health and dental fund needs to be eliminated. The county and state should be fully fund the school system to meet the needs of our students and staff.
Taxpayer dollars should be used with accountability and transparency. Taxpayer dollars should be used to fund public schools and public school students, not charter schools or private school vouchers.
A budget is a moral document that should align our values with our funding priorities.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No."

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our BOE at the moment is COVID and getting our children back into a safe and healthy learning environment. While the COVID pandemic will eventually subside as a vaccine is developed and administered, the impact of COVID will be with us for years to come. Along with the challenges exacerbated by COVID is the steady decline in performance of the HCPSS. As a lifelong resident and graduate of HCPSS as well as the mother of two boys currently in HCPSS, I am extremely concerned about the abysmal performance outcomes such as only 56 percent proficiency in English Language Arts for all 4th graders and similar performance in math that have become the norm in HCPSS. We have a school system in decline that requires new and innovative thinking to address consistent budgetary shortfalls, increasing class sizes, and a new norm of cutting critical educational programs.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
I unequivocally support the Black Lives Matter movement and, like many Americans, have been devastated and angered by the treatment of Black and Brown people in our country. I believe we must do all we can to ensure that Black lives are valued just as every life should be valued in our society.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
I do not support the campaign to ""defund"" the police. I do support retraining police to focus more on deescalation and approaches to ensure all citizens are treated fairly and equally. I do support adding counselors to the police rolls to support police during calls involving domestic abuse and mental health.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
I believe the state and national response to the COVID-19 pandemic were reasonable, even if not optimal, given what we knew at the time decisions were being made. I think it is easy to criticize leaders in hindsight after additional information has become available. Given our lack of understanding of fundamental characteristics of COVID-19 and our inability to provide an appropriate response, the decisions to limit travel, close non-essential businesses and mandate mask-wearing were all appropriate.
The goal of these measures was to flatten the curve of COVID-19 spread as we understood that no reasonable measures that protect the freedoms we enjoy in this country would have eliminated the virus. We have been successful in flattening the curve and I believe reopening businesses, while continuing to mandate mask wearing in public, is sound public health guidance. I do not favor nationwide mandates given the heterogeneity across our country, with some rural geographic regions having much sparser populations compared with urban environments that are much denser. I believe we need targeted, common-sense mandates.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
The critical differences between me and my opponent are my absolute focus on what is in the best interest of HCPSS students, families and educators - as opposed to politicians and developers - and my substantive experience in successfully leading large, complex organizations and budgets. My opponent's primary experience is volunteering in classrooms. While this is admirable, I have volunteered and led PTA and classroom activities for years and know that this does not provide sufficient experience to lead a billion dollar school system and provide oversight of critical programs and staff. In addition, as a community member with zero political aspirations and not beholden to special interests, I will be laser focused on what is best for Howard County students, families and educators.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)
The current board member in our district has failed the community and HCPSS in many ways. She has championed cuts to educators and special education, tore communities apart in a reckless redistricting plan that shuffled over 5,000 students to different schools while failing to meaningfully address overcrowding or equity, bullied a fellow Board member to tears during a public meeting, had two Open Meetings Act violations, and lectured and dismissed her constituents who were critical of her handling of HCPSS matters. I decided to run for BOE this year because Howard County District 4 voters deserve a representative who listens and cares about their concerns.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
The primary issues that define my campaign platform are accountability, transparency and budgetary responsibility. I believe taxpayers deserve to be kept informed regarding HCPSS issues, challenges and results and that our leaders need to be held accountable for their decisions. Board meetings that do not provide open and honest conversations about topics of critical interest to constituents do not serve Howard County, they serve the individuals in power. We must demand more of our leaders including accountability and transparency. Finally, the HCPSS is a school system that continues to increase class sizes (cut educators) year after year while adding administrative positions and increasing salaries for those highly-paid administrators. We need fiscally responsible decision making that aligns resources to HCPSS' mission and ensures a balanced budget.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
The accomplishments in my past that are most relevant to this job are establishment and leadership of growing, successful organizations with hundreds of staff. As an executive leader in a >$1B organization, I have significant experience in dealing with budgetary constraints and challenges, using data to make informed decisions aligned with organizational and strategic goals, and holding people accountable. I also have extensive experience building alliances across different organizations and bringing people together to collaboratively solve complex problems. I focus on identifying and solving complicated, and often complex, problems collegially and collaboratively while treating everyone with respect.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

The accomplishment that would make my term in office a success would be reversing the trend of declining performance of HCPSS students as well as the declining morale of HCPSS educators. I'd like to have measurable positive impact on the educational outcomes of all students in HCPSS.

Why should voters trust you?

Voters should trust me because I have no competing interests - such as a desire to further a career in politics - that would divert my attention from what is in the best interest of Howard County residents. I am a lifelong resident of Howard County, a graduate of HCPSS and the mother of two children currently in HCPSS schools. My sole motivation for running is to remove influence from politicians and developers on HCPSS decision-making and refocus our school system on providing an excellent education to all Howard County children.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

My views on fiscal policy and the handling of taxpayer dollars in HCPSS is that we must spend the money given to the school system by the County Council wisely.. We spend approximately $16,000 per student in HCPSS - this is one of the highest per student spending rates in the country - yet our performance continues to decline while other school systems that spend far less have been thriving (pre-COVID). We must be more responsible and wise with spending precious tax-payer dollars and work to increase the effectiveness of our investments.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

There is no reason I would not serve my full term in office.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
The best advice ever shared with me was to handle yourself with your head and handle others with your heart. This has been invaluable advice over my career because I have found that not letting my emotions or opinions get in the way of how I engage with others is critical to building trust and giving everyone a voice. I have also learned that when dealing with others, it is important for them to know that their feelings and concerns are being listened to and taken into account in decision-making to the extent possible. It's also important to explain why certain decisions are made and, again, to reflect input that was received and why decisions may have been counter to that input. It is unlikely that everyone will always agree with the decisions, but communicating clearly why they were made allows even those who disagree to understand that their input was considered.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I would like voters to know that I have run my campaign as a grassroots effort with no support or funding from political parties. In today's ultra-partisan environment, given the significant concerns with politics at the national level, I think it is even more important to ensure our children do not become pawns in partisan politics. I am an unaffiliated voter with no allegiance to either major political party, and I am running solely to ensure Howard County children come first when we make decisions regarding HCPSS."

According to data compiled by the U.S. Elections Project which is being run by University of Florida Professor Michael McDonald, more than 2.1 million voters across Maryland had already cast their ballot as of Monday.
Statistics compiled by the New York Times show that the number of people who have cast their ballots early across the state is 78 percent higher than in 2016, when 1.63 million voters requested absentee ballots, according to data, and when the state set an all-time, single-day record for early voting with more than 143,000.
According to reports, Monday's totals of voters who had cast ballots ahead of Election Day was heavily dominated by Democrats, of which more than 1.3 million (60.3 percent of registered Democrats) had voted early. Meanwhile, data shows that 511,220 Republicans voted early (23.5 percent) while more than 345,300 voters with no registered party affiliation had cast ballots.
The Baltimore Sun reported on Monday that many Maryland residents chose to cast their votes early as a way to avoid possibly lengthy lines at polling places around the state on Tuesday.
According to reports, of the more than 2 million people who had voted early, more than 1.2 million had done so through mail-in ballots. The early voting slowed significantly after a record-setting Opening Day on Oct. 26 when just more than 161,000 people turned out for the first day of early voting, according to the Sun. The turnout compares to the state's previous record for single-day voting in 2016, when 143,623 people showed up, according to reports.
McDonald, the University of Florida professor, told reporters that the early turnout in Maryland mirrored what is happening across the United States, where a record number of voters joined the trend of casting early ballots.
""That's something we've seen pretty much in every state on the first day of early voting,"" McDonald, said.
""We're getting long lines and upwards of twice the number of people voting than did, say, in 2016. We're seeing record numbers across the country.""
By Saturday, state elections officials announced that only 59,128 showed up to vote in person - three days ahead of when polls opened on Election Day. However, because of the high number of mail-in ballots that have been cast across the state, Maryland elections officials are not expected to have totals tallied by the end of Tuesday, The New York Times reported."

This year, Howard County voters will decide on races for president, members of Congress, judges and school board members.
Voters who mail in their ballots must make sure that the envelope is postmarked on or before Election Day. A voted ballot must be received by the local board of elections by 10 a.m. on Nov. 13. Voters can check and see if their mail-in ballot was received. Visit the voter look-up website to verify if the local board of elections received a request for a ballot and the status of a submitted mail-in ballot.
Voters who would like to drop their ballots off at a secure ballot box for the 2020 election have numerous options across Howard County. According to the Howard County Board of Elections, multiple secure ballot drop boxes have been set up and are under surveillance 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ballot boxes will be available until 8 p.m. on Nov. 3.
Here is where the nine designated ballot drop box locations are in Howard County:
Residents can vote early between through Nov. 2. These sites will be open between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Nov. 2 (Any Howard County voter can vote at any early voting center.)

Under the theme ""We Rise Together,"" Ball addressed the county's response to the coronavirus pandemic and announced the next major step in the county's recovery effort, ""The HoCo RISE Collaborative.""
The HoCo RISE Collaborative, an effort chaired by former Howard County Executive Ken Ulman, comprised of five independent work groups that will focus on jobs and the economy, education and workforce development, healthcare, quality of life and government response. During his speech, Ball highlighted Howard County's coronavirus response and recovery, economic challenges ahead, as well as non-coronavirus issues and opportunities such as flood mitigation in Ellicott City, environmental sustainability efforts, education funding and support services and public safety, equity and mental health initiatives launched during the past year.
""In our inaugural public State of the County, I want to talk directly to you – our residents and business owners of Howard County. As we've spent many of the last months filled with anxiety and uncertainty, I can confidently say, the state of Howard County is strong and resilient,"" Ball said during his speech. ""From great adversity emerges enduring strength. We are putting people back to work safely, assisting those in need and making sure Howard County is striving, not only to be the best overall, but for all. Throughout this year, we have tackled many challenges, and while we're not out of the woods just yet, we know that if we work together – we rise together.""

Ball also announced the launch of a government-wide serology effort so that members of the county workforce can determine if they have antibodies for COVID-19. While antibodies do not necessarily mean people are immune to COVID-19, it does provide a better understanding of the scope of potential initial spread of the virus from this spring, Ball said.

Throughout his remarks, Ball reflected on the county's impact from and response to the coronavirus pandemic. Ball recognized and thanked Howard County's coronavirus heroes such as doctors, nurses, hospital staff, first responders, essential workers and volunteers. He also noted the collaboration and partnership throughout the pandemic with organizations such as the Howard County General Hospital, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, Columbia Community Care, along with essential Howard County government departments such as the Howard County Health Department, fire and rescue services, office of emergency management, the department of community resources and services, and the department of technology and communications Services.

Ball emphasized and detailed specific county coronavirus response and recovery efforts such as:
· Acquiring enough PPE for essential healthcare organizations, including 300,000 units of PPE donated from local community organizations.
· Creating online mapping tools for families to find food distribution sites and establish areas of collection to navigate the ever-expanding needs, supporting farmers through HoCo Farm Connect for residents to invest in our community farms and buy local produce, and boosting business at our restaurants through HoCo Food Go.
· Allocating from the county's $57 million in CARES Act funding toward:
o $28 million to the Howard County Health Department to support critical efforts to combat the virus
o $5.7 million to support struggling industries across our county through the HoCo RISE Business Grant program
o $3.58 million dollars to provide rental assistance for up to three months for more than 800 families facing lost income due to COVID-19
o $1.5 million in Rise to the Challenge Grants to 40 non-profits providing critical services and support to residents

Financially, Ball noted Howard County achieved a AAA bond rating from all three rating agencies for the 23rd year in row, which provides a good foundation for future recovery. Ball also addressed several critical areas and issues outside of the county's coronavirus response such as:"

Gov. Boyd Rutherford, the Howard County Opioid Crisis Community Council and Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care to recognize the efforts of first responders in the battle against substance misuse.
""On behalf of all Howard County residents, my sincerest thanks to all our first responders for your service to our communities,"" Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said. ""The challenges you have faced and adapted to this year is a testament to your professionalism and dedication to keeping Howard County safe. Our continued efforts to save lives, encourage recovery, and ensure all our residents are healthy and thriving would not be possible without our first responders.""
Rutherford noted that during the coronavirus pandemic, first responders have been called upon for assistance even more so than before.

""I've had a lot of focus on the opioid crisis, and the challenges that we face. Our first responders are literally the first ones on the scene when people are in crisis associated with substance use disorder. They are often the difference between life and death for these individuals,"" Rutherford said.

Certificates of appreciation where distributed to officials for their role in supporting residents facing substance misuse and recovery. Those acknowledged include the Howard County Police Department, the Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services, Sheriff Marcus Harris, State's Attorney Richard Gibson and Howard County Department of Corrections Director Jack Kavanagh.

""I am a survivor of a Narcan revived overdose, administered to me in Howard County,"" said Matt Stout, Howard County resident and person in recovery. ""The reality of my family remaining in one piece is solely the result of steadfast first responders and protocols in place to revive the addict. I assure you my mother and father have their son today because of the work you do. We thank you."""

Ball also wrote a letter to the Biden Administration transition team emphasizing the need for changes to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and their current operations in the country.
""Four years ago, I co-sponsored CB-9, a bill that would protect undocumented immigrants in Howard County from discrimination,"" Ball said. ""This legislation was important to me to help protect many of our residents who lived in constant fear of being detained and deported as they worked hard to support their families and children. Several components of this legislation are already practiced by our departments and today, I am proud to sign Council Member Dr. Opel Jones' Liberty Act legislation to further protect innocent, undocumented residents in Howard County.""

In September, Ball changed qualifications for Howard County Detention Center to only hold ICE detainees who been convicted of a crime of violence as defined in Maryland Criminal Law Code annotated section 14-101. Under the previous policy, the department of corrections could house ICE detainees who have been charged with or convicted of jailable offenses. The list of violent crimes included in the statute has been defined by the Maryland General Assembly and include such crimes as murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery and more serious assaults and sexual offenses.

""This historic legislation addresses inequities that face our communities, specifically the underrepresented and vulnerable immigrant communities,"" Council Member Opel Jones said. ""These major challenges that face our immigrant communities, face all of us since we are community of one. Every resident of this great county prides themselves on an all-inclusive community theme that boasts to 'Choose Civility.' Drafting this legislation, promoting, and garnering support for it renewed this legislative urgency.""

Howard County does not and has never participated in the 287(g) program like in Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties during the 25 years of its contract. The Howard County Detention Center also does not and has never housed women or children. Additionally, Howard County police are not involved in any way with transporting ICE detainees in custody or to the detention center. ICE agents make the arrests, process all intakes at their Baltimore field office and then use a private contractor to transport detainees to the Howard County Detention Center."

The project is one of only eight across the U.S. to be awarded a capital advance grant through HUD's Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program. The Howard County Department of Housing and Community Development has committed $2 million toward construction costs for the $30 million project.
""Our community strives to be inclusive and innovative – and the Patuxent Commons project checks both of those boxes, we're thrilled to support this important housing initiative,"" Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said in a statement. ""This new housing was designed in partnership with Howard County Autism Society and will support residents with disabilities and of all ages. In Howard County we recognized that providing this resource to people with disabilities can lead to more enriching and independent lives, and we are committed to building on this progress. As we close out a year of continued physical isolation and suffering mental health, it's vital we continue to support and advocate for creating a community that is connected and allows for a high quality of life for all.""
The 76-unit Patuxent Commons is a mixed-income development based on a concept developed by the Howard County Autism Society to help meet the housing needs of adults with disabilities and is the first of its kind in Howard County. The developer of Patuxent Commons and recipient of the HUD grant is Mission First Housing Group, an award-winning affordable housing developer of more than 3,500 apartments across the mid-Atlantic. Their plans for the project call for 19 apartments to be set-aside for adults with disabilities, and the remainder for older adults, families and younger adults.

""Howard County is excited to support this project with $2 million in MIHU fee-in-lieu funds,"" DHCD Director Kelly Cimino said . ""Providing access to MIHU fee-in-lieu funding is critical to projects like this one to create long-term, affordable rental opportunities for adults with disabilities, older adults and families in the county.""

Efforts are underway to secure the remaining financing for the project, which will be in Columbia's Hickory Ridge Village neighborhood. In September, Mission First applied to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development's Community Development Administration for low-income housing tax credit financing. If secured, the LIHTC award will fund nearly half of the project's total costs."
