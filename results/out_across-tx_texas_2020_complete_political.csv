Prison food is notoriously bad, even in the best of times. This isn't the best of times, especially in the 40-plus Texas prisons where people are locked in their cells all the time because of coronavirus.
Their food now arrives at odd hours in paper bags, cold, mushy and without a hint of green (except perhaps for some iffy-looking hot dogs). Mostly it's stale white bread and mystery meat, with the occasional helping of raisins or prunes.
This is what people inside have been telling The Marshall Project since the first of the lockdowns began in early April. To prove their points, they started sending out photos.
An official manual outlines the recommended calories for ""wholesome and nutritious"" meals, and includes a narrow assortment of suggested items that mostly sound palatable. But in our pictures, the sloppy joes look like the peanut butter sandwiches, except for the corn kernels. The hot dogs are wrapped in smushed white bread, the milk comes in powdered form and any semblance of a fresh fruit or vegetable is utterly absent.
Cornbread and eggs.
But even though it doesn't look like food you or your dog would want to eat, prisoners and their families say they're not getting enough of it. In the middle of a pandemic, they say they are going to bed hungry.
""The conditions are so bad in here, it seems third world,"" one man wrote to his fiancée. ""The nutrition is far from adequate especially for COVID-positive inmates. You would think we would at least be given vegetables and hearty protein, something with a vitamin content.""
A prison spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Sunday. But in the past he has denied allegations that prisoners have received insufficient food.
The quality of the prison food in Texas took a nosedive in 2011 when officials tried to make up a budget shortage by chopping $2.8 million out of the allotment for meals. One document described the planned changes: replacing hot dog and hamburger buns with white bread, switching out liquid milk for milk powder and feeding inmates only twice per day on the weekends at certain facilities.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich, chicken patty, and cornbread.
At the time, prisoners noticed, and cobbled together a petition to send to the American Civil Liberties Union.
But it didn't do any good.
Not only did the regular food get markedly worse, but so did the lockdown meals. Every time a Texas prison locks down—whether it's for a weeks-long contraband search, an unexpected disturbance or a mass quarantine—the mess halls close. Bagged lunches known as ""johnny sacks"" replace regular cafeteria meals.
Now, every time someone inside tests positive for coronavirus, the entire prison goes on lockdown for at least two weeks and everyone gets johnnies. And for weeks, inmates have been complaining that they've been banned from buying food from the commissary because prison brass are treating the lockdowns like a punishment. (Earlier this month, the prison spokesman said officials are trying to operate the commissaries as normally as possible.)
The upshot of all that is that by early May, thousands of incarcerated people had not seen the sunlight or eaten a warm meal in weeks. Many said they'd only had sporadic access to phones, mail and showers.
In theory, the johnnies include a breakfast which is typically boiled eggs, dry cereal and raisins, while lunch and dinner are typically two sandwiches each—some combination of a chicken or beef patty, mystery meat or peanut butter which prisoners report is sometimes watered down with cooking oil. It sounds like a reasonable (if unbalanced) amount of food—but it doesn't really look like it in photos. ""The johnny sacks are very bad,"" Theodore ""Cigo"" Crews wrote in a letter to his daughter that she shared with The Marshall Project. Once, he said, ""We only got a foam cup of BBQ chopped beef. That's all.""
""We will not die by COVID19 but we die by hunger!! TRUTH!""
A man incarcerated at Fort Stockton Transfer Facility in Fort Stockton, Texas, wrote down all the meals he was served for two weeks.
After looking at the pictures (which did not come from Crews or anyone at his unit), a former prison official confirmed they appeared to be Texas prison johnny sacks.
""They've always been subpar,"" the ex-official said. ""They're shitty."" Although each prison is required to set aside a sample of each meal for three days in case there are later questions about the quality of the food, the official said, those samples aren't always representative.
Prisoners on locked-down units say their weird food has been arriving at weird times: one prisoner told his mother he'd received breakfast—two boiled eggs and a peanut butter sandwich—at 3 a.m.. His next packet of sandwiches didn't arrive until 4 p.m.
Weeks after the lockdowns began, prison officials told family advocacy organizations they would begin offering occasional treats from the commissary. One prisoner reported his treat had arrived: a single peppermint stick.

1,/texas/across-tx/texas-clinics-ask-supreme-court-allow-certain-abortions,2020-04-12T17:26:43Z,Texas Clinics Ask SC To Allow Certain Abortions,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Abortion clinics in Texas on Saturday asked the Supreme Court to step in to allow certain abortions to continue during the coronavirus pandemic.
The clinics filed an emergency motion asking the justices to overturn a lower-court order and allow abortions when they can be performed using medication.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order last month that bars non-essential medical procedures so that medical resources can go to treating coronavirus patients. Texas' attorney general has said that providing abortions other than for an immediate medical emergency would violate the order.
A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday allowed abortions to proceed in cases where a woman would be beyond 22 weeks pregnant, the legal limit for abortions in Texas, on April 22, the day after the governor's order barring non-essential medical procedures is set to expire.
But the appeals court order blocked for now medication abortions, which are allowed in Texas during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. In a medication abortion a woman takes one pill at a clinic and then takes a second pill 24 to 48 hours later, typically at home. The clinics have argued that medication abortions do not require personal protective equipment like masks, gloves and gowns that might be needed for coronavirus patients.
Similar legal fights over abortions during the pandemic are ongoing in Alabama, Ohio and Oklahoma.

2,/texas/across-tx/aclu-sues-7-texas-towns-passing-anti-abortion-ordinances,2020-02-27T19:59:41Z,ACLU Sues 7 TX Towns Over Anti-Abortion Ords.,0,0,Texas Tribune,News Partner,"By Edgar Walters, The Texas Tribune Feb. 25, 2020
The American Civil Liberties Union is suing seven Texas towns in federal court over recent anti-abortion ordinances declaring the towns ""sanctuary cities for the unborn.""
The controversial ordinances began popping up in small towns in East Texas last year and gradually spread across the state. Eleven towns, extending as far west as Big Spring, had passed a version of the ordinance. It aims to outlaw abortion at the local level if the U.S. Supreme Court makes it possible to do so, and it grants family members of women who have abortions the ability to sue the provider for emotional distress. Some towns also included language to ban the sale of emergency contraception such as Plan B.
""The ordinances' existence misleads residents of these cities as to whether individuals can in fact exercise their right to access abortion,"" civil liberties lawyers representing the Texas Equal Access Fund and the Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equity, which help women afford abortions, wrote in a court filing. Some towns included language in their ordinances labeling the groups ""criminal organizations.""
The strategy of bringing the abortion fight to the local level has divided even the staunchest anti-abortion activists. Some groups have warned against taking an inflammatory approach that is unlikely to survive a legal contest and could set the anti-abortion movement back in court. And several towns — including Mineral Wells, Omaha and Jacksboro — have voted down similar ordinances or walked them back under advice from city attorneys.
""ACLU sues seven Texas towns for passing local anti-abortion ordinances"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
But other conservative activists have traveled across the state, urging city councils to pass versions of the ordinance.
""These communities have shown great courage in standing up against the abortion industry,"" Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life, said in a statement.
Most provisions of the ordinance would not take effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court issues a new opinion on the legality of abortion. Specifically, the high court would need to overrule its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, a case that originated in Texas and led to the legalization of abortion nationwide by nullifying state laws that banned the procedure.
And the court would need to reverse its 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which allowed states to enact abortion restrictions only if they do not place an ""undue burden"" on a woman seeking to terminate her pregnancy.
But the ordinances, which do not make exceptions for rape or incest, immediately allow ""any surviving relative of the aborted unborn child"" to sue a person in civil court for performing an abortion within the towns where they were passed. In some towns, a person could also be sued for transporting a woman to an abortion clinic or helping pay for the procedure, though local officials have said that language is largely symbolic and would be difficult to enforce.
The lawsuit claims the ordinances are discriminatory against reproductive rights activists. ""Their prohibition of speech and association applies only to those with a pro-choice viewpoint,"" the lawsuit says. ""Organizations with an anti-abortion viewpoint, such as the one that promoted the ordinances, may operate and speak freely about their anti-abortion views within these cities.""

3,/texas/across-tx/fort-worth-receives-d-grade-fiscal-health,2020-01-28T10:00:00Z,Fort Worth receives 'D' grade for fiscal health,0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"A new report on the financial condition of the 75 most populous cities ranks Fort Worth no. 61 in the nation for fiscal health. The report is based on the cities' 2018 comprehensive annual financial reports, which are not analyzed on this scale by any other organization.
The analysis by Truth in Accounting (TIA), a nonprofit government finance watchdog group, found Fort Worth needs $3.2 billion to get out of the red, or $12,300.00 from each of its taxpayers.
According to the watchdog's annual Financial State of the Cities report, Fort Worth has $5 billion in bills and only $1.8 billion in available assets to pay those bills after capital and restricted assets are excluded. This results in a $3.2 billion shortfall, or a $12,300.00 Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of the municipal debt after the city's available assets have been tapped.
TIA's Taxpayer Burden indicator incorporates both assets and liabilities, including all retirement liabilities. Fiscal year 2018 was the first year city governments reported all retirement liabilities, but TIA has been including this information in their analysis for the last several years.
The bottom line is that Fort Worth does not have enough money to pay its bills, which is why it received a ""D"" grade for its fiscal health.

4,/texas/across-tx/judge-trump-cant-let-states-veto-refugee-resettlement,2020-01-15T21:13:26Z,Trump Can't Let States 'Veto' Refugee Resettlement,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — President Donald Trump can't give state and local governments ""veto power"" to reject refugees from resettling within their borders, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte agreed to block Trump's executive order requiring resettlement agencies to get written consent from state and local officials in any jurisdiction where they want to resettle refugees beyond June 2020.
In his 31-page ruling, Messitte said the agencies are likely to succeed in showing that November's executive order is unlawful because it gives state and local governments veto power over the resettlement of refugees. The judge issued a preliminary injunction requested by three resettlement agencies that sued to challenge the executive order.
Messitte concluded Trump's order doesn't appear to serve the ""overall public interest.""
""Refugee resettlement activity should go forward as it developed for the almost 40 years before (the executive order) was announced,"" he wrote.
The administration didn't immediately say whether it will appeal Messitte's decision. The State Department said it is reviewing the decision and has no immediate comment.
Church World Service, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service and HIAS — a Jewish nonprofit — filed the lawsuit in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Nov. 21. They are three of the nine national organizations agencies that have agreements with the federal government to provide housing and other services for refugees. The agencies argued the order illegally conflicts with the 1980 Refugee Act.
Texas, which took in more refugees than any other state during the 2018 fiscal year, became the first state known to reject the resettlement of new refugees. Gov. Greg Abbott said in a letter released Jan. 10 that Texas ""has been left by Congress to deal with disproportionate migration issues resulting from a broken federal immigration system.""
The head of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, said the ruling puts on hold a policy that was causing ""irreparable harm to refugee families and resettlement agency's already. "" She added that it essentially reopens the door to refugees being resettled in Texas.
""It's a significant day in which the rule of law won,"" O'Mara Vignarajah said.
So far 42 states have publicly agreed to accept refugees, but a governor's decision wouldn't preclude local officials from refusing to give their consent. For instance, the Democratic mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts, has refused to give written consent for refugees to be resettled in the city.
Trump's order says his administration acted to respect communities that believe they do not have the jobs or other resources to be able to take in refugees. Refugees have the right to move anywhere in the U.S. after their initial resettlement, but at their own expense.
John Wittman, a spokesman for Gov. Abbott, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Wednesday's ruling.
Mark Hetfield, the head of HIAS, estimated about 1,800 refugees this year will be resettled in Texas, where most have family members already, unless the Trump administration appeals the ruling and wins. Mayors from the state's major cities have welcomed them.
Ali Al Sudani, chief programs officer for Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston, said many refugees were anxious after Abbott's announcement. One Iraqi man contacted Al Sudani to say that he was in the process of being approved to go to Texas and asked whether he should request another state instead.
""It's great news, but we don't want this to polarize different communities even further,"" Al Sudani said. ""I hope and wish that everyone would come and see the fact that this is the right thing to do.""
During a Jan. 8 hearing, Justice Department attorney Bradley Humphreys said the Refugee Act gives the president ""ample authority"" to make such a change.
""Why change it now?"" Messitte asked. ""Is it purely a political thing?""
Humphreys said the executive order is designed to enhance the involvement of state and local officials in the process of resettling refugees. But he insisted it doesn't give them a veto over resettlement decisions.
Messitte said it ""borders on Orwellian Newspeak"" for the administration to claim that the order is meant to merely ""enhance the consultation"" between the federal governments and the states and localities.
""It grants them veto power. Period,"" he wrote in his order.
And giving that veto power to the state and local governments ""flies in the face of clear Congressional intent,"" the judge concluded.
The Trump administration has capped the number of refugee admissions at 18,000 for the current fiscal year. About 30,000 refugees were resettled in the U.S. during the past fiscal year; between 150,000 and 200,000 remain in the pipeline for possible U.S. resettlement while they live abroad, according to plaintiffs' attorney Linda Evarts, of the International Refugee Assistance Project.

5,/texas/across-tx/2-tx-residents-among-10-nfl-players-charged-fraud-scheme-doj,2019-12-12T17:04:44Z,2 Former TX NFL Players Charged By DOJ,0,0,Feroze Dhanoa,Patch Staff,"Federal authorities have charged 10 former NFL players, including two who are currently Texas residents, in what they called a nationwide scheme to defraud a health care benefit program for retired players of millions of dollars.
Ceandris, Brown, 36, of Fresno, Texas, a former player for the Houston Texans, and Correll Buckhalter, 41, of Colleyville, Texas, who has played for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Denver Broncos, are facing charges.
Brown is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of wire fraud and one count of health care fraud. Buckhalter is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud.
Federal prosecutors accuse the former NFL players of targeting the Gene Upshaw NFL Player Health Reimbursement Account Plan, which provided tax-free reimbursement for out-of-pocket medical care expenses not covered by insurance. Those charged made more than $3.9 million in false and fraudulent claims against the plan and were paid out $3.4 million between June 2017 and December 2018, the Justice Department said.
The other players charged in the alleged fraud are:
Robert McCune, 40, of Riverdale Georgia, charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, nine counts of wire fraud and nine counts of health care fraud. McCune was drafted by the Washington Redskins when he began his career and he has also played for the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens.
John Eubanks, 36, of Cleveland, Mississippi; Tamarick Vanover, 45, of Tallahassee, Florida; and Carlos Rogers, 38, of Alpharetta, Georgia, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, two counts of wire fraud and two counts of health care fraud. Eubanks has played football in Canada and also played for the Washington Redskins. Vanover has played for the Kansas City Chiefs and San Diego Chargers. Rogers has played for the Redskins, the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders.
Clinton Portis, 38, of McLean, Virginia; James Butler, 37, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Frederick Bennett, 35, of Port Wentworth, Georgia, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of wire fraud and one count of health care fraud. Portis has played for the Washington Redskins and the Denver Broncos. Butler has played for the New York Giants and the St. Louis Rams.
Etric Pruitt, 38, of Theodore, Alabama, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud. Pruitt has played for a number of teams including the Atlanta Falcons and the Seattle Seahawks.
Government prosecutors also said they have filed notice that they intend to charge Joseph Horn, 47, of Columbia, South Carolina, and Donald ""Reche"" Caldwell, 40, of Tampa, Florida, with conspiracy to commit health care fraud.
""Ten former NFL players allegedly committed a brazen, multi-million dollar fraud on a health care plan meant to help their former teammates and other retired players pay legitimate, out-of-pocket medical expenses,"" Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski said in a prepared statement. ""Today's indictments underscore that whoever you are, if you loot health care programs to line your own pockets, you will be held accountable by the Department of Justice.""
The indictments filed by federal authorities say the scheme involved submitting false and fraudulent claims to the plan for expensive medical equipment, between $40,000-$50,000 for each claim. The equipment was never purchased, officials said.
Five of the former players — McCune, Eubanks, Vanover, Buckhalter and Rogers — recruited others into the scheme by offering to submit fraudulent claims in exchange for kickbacks and bribes, the department alleged.
""As part of the scheme, the defendants allegedly fabricated supporting documentation for the claims, including invoices, prescriptions and letters of medical necessity,"" officials said.
After submitting the claims, the government said McCune and Buckhalter are accused of calling the phone number provided by the plan and impersonated other players to check on the status of the claims.

7,/texas/across-tx/inside-weslaco-cell-where-sick-teenage-boy-died-border-patrol-care,2019-12-06T17:23:16Z,Weslaco Cell Where Sick Teenage Boy Died,0,0,Pro Publica,News Partner,"By Robert Moore and Susan Schmidt, special to ProPublica, and Maryam Jameel, ProPublica
Originally published on Thursday, December 5

Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant, was seriously ill when immigration agents put him in a small South Texas holding cell with another sick boy on the afternoon of May 19.
A few hours earlier, a nurse practitioner at the Border Patrol's dangerously overcrowded processing center in McAllen had diagnosed him with the flu and measured his fever at 103 degrees. She said that he should be checked again in two hours and taken to the emergency room if his condition worsened.
None of that happened. Worried that Carlos might infect other migrants in the teeming McAllen facility, officials moved him to a cell for quarantine at a Border Patrol station in nearby Weslaco.
By the next morning, he was dead.
In a press release that day, Customs and Border Protection's acting commissioner at the time, John Sanders, called Carlos' death a ""tragic loss."" The agency said that an agent had found Carlos ""unresponsive"" after checking in on him. Sanders said the Border Patrol was ""committed to the health, safety and humane treatment of those in our custody.""
But the record shows that the Border Patrol fell far short of that standard with Carlos. ProPublica has obtained video that documents the 16-year-old's last hours, and it shows that Border Patrol agents and health care workers at the Weslaco holding facility missed increasingly obvious signs that his condition was perilous.
The cellblock video shows Carlos writhing for at least 25 minutes on the floor and a concrete bench. It shows him staggering to the toilet and collapsing on the floor, where he remained in the same position for the next four and a half hours.
According to a ""subject activity log"" maintained by the Border Patrol throughout Carlos' custody, an agent checked on him three times during the early morning hours in which he slipped from unconsciousness to death, but reported nothing alarming about the boy.
The video shows the only way CBP officials could have missed Carlos' crisis is that they weren't looking. His agony was apparent, even in grainy black and white, making clear the agent charged with monitoring him failed to perform adequate checks, if he even checked at all. The coroner who performed an autopsy on Carlos said she was told the agent occasionally looked into the cell through the window.
The video makes clear that CBP, the Border Patrol's parent agency, inaccurately described how Carlos' body was discovered. Contrary to the agency's press release, it was Carlos' cellmate who found him, not agents doing an early morning check. On the video, the cellmate can be seen waking up and groggily walking to the toilet, where Carlos was lying in a pool of blood on the floor. He gestures for help at the cell door. Only then do agents enter the cell and discover that Carlos had died during the night.
Officials with the Department of Homeland Security, which includes CBP, wouldn't say whether the scenes recorded by the camera during Carlos' final hours were shown live on video monitors, as is the case in some Border Patrol facilities, and if they were, whether anyone had been assigned to watch the footage.
The video and other records reviewed by ProPublica document numerous missteps in the days leading up to Carlos' final hours on the floor of Cell 199. Independent medical experts pointed in particular to the decision to send a 16-year-old suffering from the flu to a holding cell rather than a hospital as a pivotal mistake.
""Why is a teenaged boy in a jail facility at all if he is sick with a transmissible illness? Why isn't he at a hospital or at a home or clinic where he can get a warm bed, fluids, supervised attention and medical care? He is not a criminal,"" said Dr. Judy Melinek, a San Francisco-based forensic pathologist who reviewed records of Carlos' death at the request of ProPublica. ""No one should die this way: vomiting, with a fever and without the comfort of a caregiver.""
A CBP spokesman declined to respond to a series of questions about Carlos' death, citing an ongoing internal investigation. ""While we cannot discuss specific information or details of this investigation, we can tell you that the Department of Homeland Security and this agency are looking into all aspects of this case to ensure all procedures were followed,"" CBP spokesperson Matt Leas said.
CBP has refused to release the video and other records of Carlos' death to the public or Congress, citing the ongoing internal investigation. But using Texas open records laws, ProPublica obtained material from the Weslaco Police Department, which briefly investigated his death. The records included surveillance video, detainee logs and health records turned over to police by Border Patrol.
Interviews and documents illustrate how immigration and child welfare agencies, while grappling with surging migrant numbers, were unable to meet their own guidelines for processing and caring for children. With holding tanks that were never equipped to house migrants for more than a few hours, the Border Patrol was inundated with families and children. Shelters for children, offering beds and medical care, were already packed.
The agency held Carlos for six days, though the agency is supposed to transfer children within 72 hours.
Carlos was the sixth migrant child to die after being detained while entering the U.S. in less than a year. Some died of preexisting illnesses, but at least two others died of the flu diagnosed while in Border Patrol custody. Carlos was the only one to die at a Border Patrol station; the others were taken to medical facilities after falling ill. In the previous decade, not a single migrant child had died in custody.
Carlos' death prompted changes to require Border Patrol agents to enter the cells of ailing detainees at regular intervals to check on them and take temperatures, according to a source familiar with the fallout.
The DHS inspector general has been investigating the circumstances of Carlos' death but has not released any findings.
Sanders, the acting head of the agency, resigned soon after the incident. He recently faulted unprepared agencies and an unresponsive Congress for a tragedy that he said was both predictable and preventable.
The deaths of Carlos and other children under his watch continue to haunt him. ""I believe the U.S. government could have done more,"" he said.
Carlos left his remote village in central Guatemala in early May. San Jose del Rodeo, home to indigenous Maya, is set in a lush landscape, and the village is a collection of tin-roofed houses and smoky outdoor cooking fires. The valleys below provide most of what little work there is, on farms growing and harvesting corn, coffee beans and sugar cane.
Carlos, the second youngest of eight children, was a standout student at the village school. He was captain of the soccer team and excelled in playing instruments the school had bought by selling raffle tickets. ""He played percussion and the bombo and the lyre and the trumpet,"" said Jose Morales Pereira, who was Carlos' teacher. ""He always said, 'Professor, let's teach everyone else.' He was my leader.""
Bartoleme Hernandez, Carlos' father, worked when he could planting corn or clearing land. He wore cut up tires on his feet to save his shoes for Sundays. Money was so tight that Carlos sometimes came to school with no lunch and did weekend farm work and odd jobs to help out, his teacher said.
As children, Carlos and his friends made a game of pretending to cross the border. To reach their imaginary U.S., they scaled a fence, and Carlos always played the one who made it across. The kids used guava leaves as pretend money to send to family back home, recalled a childhood friend who described the game in a Facebook post.
Two dozen or more young friends had traveled to the U.S. before Carlos. Crossing the border typically cost migrants $5,000 to $10,000 for smugglers who offer safe passage through drug cartel territory. Some migrants take out loans to fund their travel; Carlos told his teacher he might work along the way to pay his fees. He had a brother already in the U.S., and he planned to find a construction job.
Starting late last year, smugglers ran express buses up through Mexico to meet demand. A family member said Carlos and his sister traveled by bus for much of their journey. At the Rio Grande on May 13, they wore life vests and crowded onto a rubber raft with a half-dozen others.
Their parents received a video that day — later shared with the media — showing them casting off into the river. The siblings landed near Hidalgo at the southern tip of Texas, part of a group of 70 that was immediately rounded up by border agents.
In custody, Carlos was separated from his adult sister, as required under the law. He was assigned an alien identification number — A203665141 — to help agencies track him. A Border Patrol agent at the warehouselike processing center in McAllen screened Carlos for illness or injury and found none.
Migrants were supposed to be held in CBP centers for no more than three days before being deported, moved to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers or released pending a hearing. Under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, children and teenagers crossing the border illegally without parents or guardian generally must be placed with the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours, except in the case of heavy influx. Then they must be moved out as quickly as possible.
But Carlos had arrived at the peak of the surge, with 144,000 migrants apprehended in May alone. With the overflow crowds, nothing was working as it should have been. HHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement were backlogged in transferring children out of CBP custody. In a spot check soon after Carlos died, the DHS inspector general reported that a third of the 2,800 unaccompanied minors in CBP custody in the Rio Grande Valley had been there longer than 72 hours.
Authorities at first questioned whether Carlos was a minor and whether the woman he was traveling with was his sister, according to a CBP source with knowledge of the matter. It took agents 48 hours to determine he was a few weeks shy of his 17th birthday, and the confusion delayed the search for HHS shelter space.
The McAllen facility where Carlos arrived on May 13 was barely fit for habitation. The DHS inspector general visited Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol facilities about a month later, as the number of apprehensions had begun to decline, and found holding pens packed well beyond capacity and other appalling conditions. The inspector general's urgent alert to management warned that the overcrowding posed ""an immediate risk to the health and safety"" of both agents and detainees, including through the spread of infectious diseases.
Border Patrol centers were designed to temporarily hold migrants and were not set up for long-term detention, which typically includes medical staff to treat detainees who become ill. The agency had a handful of emergency medical technicians assigned to the centers. In late 2018, it had only 20 medical staffers working under contract along the 2,000-mile Mexican border to monitor the health needs of 50,000 apprehended migrants a month. CBP brought in medics from the Coast Guard and other federal agencies after two children died in custody in December and as the number of border crossers in custody began to approach 100,000 a month.
At the high point of the migrant surge in May, the Border Patrol had custody of 20,000 people a day; its definition of a crisis is 6,000 detainees.
As the surge escalated and Sanders and others pressed for help, the DHS shifted $47 million for additional medical staff to its contract provider, Loyal Source Government Services. (The company did not respond to requests for comment.)
Loyal Source increased its hiring, running a stream of job ads like one seeking EMTs for screenings at the Weslaco Border Patrol station, where Carlos died, that offered full-time, part-time, day, night and weekend shifts.
The prospect of flu outbreaks was a growing concern. The CBP had rejected a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it vaccinate migrants, saying such a program was impractical and complex. Amid the crowding, Border Patrol agents, trained in law enforcement, had reluctantly stepped into care-taking roles.
If Carlos had made it to an HHS shelter, he likely would have been vaccinated for the flu, a standard procedure in HHS shelters. But when HHS finally found a bed for him, the agency postponed his relocation because he had the flu and was not fit to travel.
Carlos had been detained in McAllen for six days when he reported feeling ill.
At 1 a.m. on May 19, he saw a nurse practitioner and complained of a headache and fever. Tests showed he had type A flu and a 103-degree fever. Nurse practitioner Irasema Gonzalez gave him ibuprofen and Tylenol and ordered Tamiflu, which is a standard treatment for flu symptoms.
Gonzalez's treatment report also said Carlos should ""return to medical office in 2 hrs or sooner"" and should be taken to an emergency room if his symptoms persisted or worsened. There is no record of further medical treatment over the next 19 hours in the records obtained by ProPublica. Gonzalez didn't respond to an inquiry from ProPublica.
Carlos was not sent to an emergency room or other outside medical facility. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said basic monitoring of Carlos should have provided warnings that he was becoming seriously ill.
""Flu can progress rapidly, but it's not like a heart attack. Even when fast, it worsens over a period of hours. There should have been signs that indicated he needed to go to the hospital,"" Sharfstein said.
Instead, records show he was moved at midday to the smaller Weslaco station, where he could be isolated with other sick detainees.
At 8 p.m. that night, Carlos was given Tamiflu at the Weslaco station by Martha Garcia, a nurse practitioner. Her treatment report didn't record a temperature or vital signs, leaving it unclear how thoroughly he had been examined. The report said Carlos had no medical complaints and was ""in no acute distress."" Garcia didn't respond to an inquiry from ProPublica.
The Border Patrol's ""subject activity log"" from early morning on May 20 shows that Carlos was given a hot meal just after midnight. It is unclear if he was able to keep down any food. Weslaco police reports say that was the last time Border Patrol agents saw him alive.
The video of Cell 199 provided to ProPublica by Weslaco police is split into two parts, the first showing more than 33 minutes beginning about 1:13 a.m. and the second showing 1 hour and 11 minutes beginning about 5:48 a.m. Weslaco Police Chief Joel Rivera said that's how Border Patrol provided the video to his investigators. The investigation ended after the coroner and police found no foul play in Carlos' death.
CBP didn't respond to questions about why the tape it provided has a four-hour gap that includes the hours when an agent reported doing welfare checks.
The time stamp on the video is inaccurate, but ProPublica was able to compare it with police and emergency medical service records to estimate that the first video begins at about 1:13 a.m., about an hour after Carlos was fed.
The beginning of the video shows Carlos on the toilet in the cell, partially obscured by a waist-high privacy wall. His cellmate, another ill boy who has not been identified, is asleep under Mylar blankets on a cement bench.
Carlos returns to the cement bench opposite his cellmate about six minutes into the video and shifts uncomfortably. He moves out of the camera's view for a couple of minutes, apparently sitting or standing next to the cell's large window.
At about 1:24 a.m., Carlos topples forward and lands face-first on the concrete floor. He is wearing blue jeans and a disposable surgical mask. For the next 11 minutes, he is largely still. At about 1:35 a.m., he vomits blood on the floor and then stands and staggers to the toilet.
The tape shows him sitting on the toilet for about a minute before he slides onto the ground. He struggles for several more minutes and then stops moving at approximately 1:39 a.m. Police photos taken after his death show a large pool of blood around his head.
The second part of the video opens at about 5:48 a.m. Carlos can be seen in the same position as he was four hours earlier. He is on his back, his head by the toilet, and his legs stretching out before him, toes up. The Border Patrol's log documenting Carlos' detention for the evening notes three welfare checks during the gap in the video, at 2:02 a.m., 4:09 a.m. and 5:05 a.m. All three log entries were attributed to Agent Oscar Garza.
Garza couldn't be reached for comment and CBP officials wouldn't answer questions about the extent of the welfare checks. The pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Norma Jean Farley, said in an interview that she had been told the agent looked through the window but didn't go inside Cell 199. She said it wouldn't be unusual for a feverish child to seek comfort by laying on a cool floor.
The CBP's policies on holding detained migrants are outlined in its National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention and Search, known as TEDS. The standards are vague about welfare check requirements, saying agents should physically check holding cells in a ""regular and frequent manner, according to each operational office's policies and procedures. Physical inspections must be recorded in the appropriate electronic system(s) of record as soon as practicable.""
At about 6:05 a.m., the tape shows, Carlos' cellmate awakens and discovers him on the floor. After about a minute, he walks over to the cell door and gets the attention of a Border Patrol agent, identified in police reports as Edgar Reyes.
The agent comes in, shines a flashlight on Carlos' body and leaves. A few minutes later, a physician assistant, Alda Martinez, comes into the cell with a medic's kit and attempts one chest compression. She quickly concluded that Carlos was dead, police reports said. Other agents walk in, stepping on silver blankets strewn around the cell. Weslaco paramedics arrive at 6:47 a.m. and declare Carlos dead.
The Border Patrol press release describing these events said ""He was found un-responsive this morning during a welfare check.""
The autopsy report did not address how long Carlos had been dead before his cellmate found him. His body had already begun to stiffen when Martinez attempted to revive him. The process of rigor mortis can be accelerated by the flu.
John Sanders had seen the crisis on the border coming as early as November 2018. Then serving as the CBP's chief operating officer, he had worked the numbers and realized that if projections about the migrant influx held true, agencies would be woefully short of shelter space for unaccompanied minors. An interagency task force monitoring the weather conditions and movements of people in Central America projected huge migrations in the coming months.
But the Trump administration agencies responsible for handling migrants, CBP and HHS, were at odds over the problem's severity. HHS shelters were then boarding about 15,000 children, but the HHS leadership believed beds would empty out quickly thanks to a policy change reluctantly implemented by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a long battle. ICE had made it less legally risky for migrant adults to come forward to pick up children in shelters by easing mandatory fingerprinting requirement implemented in April 2018. The December 2018 policy change had increased the number of children released from HHS custody.
Still the numbers kept growing. Buses and car caravans ferried groups of 100 or more migrants at a time to the border; 111 such groups arrived in the winter and spring, compared with 13 the previous year and just two in 2017. CBP told Congress the large groups overwhelmed border security and at the same time created diversions for drug smuggling.
The Trump administration asked Congress in January for $800 million to upgrade border facilities, but it approved about $414 million, including money for a new El Paso processing center to hold children and families, renovation funds for the McAllen processing center and about $192 million for ""improved medical care, transportation, and consumables"" for those in CBP custody, according to the joint statement issued when the bill was finalized. It soon became clear it wasn't enough.
Sanders was among the administration officials who appealed to Congress for additional funding. He predicted that without more funding, children would not be safe.
Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, a California Democrat who chairs the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, blamed the Trump administration for conditions that led to the deaths of Carlos and other children.
""Their deaths should never, ever have happened. Tragically, DHS was irresponsible in not having an adequate mass migration plan to keep migrants safe, ensure their humane treatment and address their health care needs,"" Roybal-Allard said. She also criticized HHS for failing to have ""a plan to ensure it could quickly and safely take custody of unaccompanied children in CBP custody.""
In April, with the border crisis deepening daily, Sanders was named acting CBP commissioner as his boss Kevin McAleenan moved up to become acting secretary of DHS. Those would prove just interim personnel shuffles by a White House determined to harden its border policies.
The fight for money became one of Sanders' top priorities. By May, as Carlos prepared to head north, the Trump administration made the case for $4.5 billion in emergency aid, with $2.9 billion to cover a shortfall in the program for unaccompanied minors. Democrats supported the humanitarian funding but many objected to $1.1 billion for additional immigrant detention spending.
Carlos' death highlighted the need for relief. White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and McAleenan, making the case for the administration's border funding request, described deteriorating conditions in a May 30 call with reporters:
""Four hundred children arrived in the last 24 hours alone. Four of those children this month have died transiting through Mexico into the United States — two drowning in a river, both a 5-year-old and 10-month-old; and two teenage boys died of infections after receiving medical treatment in federal custody,"" McAleenan said. ""Yesterday, a single group of 1,036 families and unaccompanied children simply walked from Juárez, Mexico, into the United States illegally as a single group — the largest group ever apprehended at the border.""
Another month would pass before a majority in Congress agreed on the humanitarian funding.
A police investigation into Carlos' death began soon after his body was discovered, the case assigned to Det. Chris Ramirez of the Weslaco Police Department. There was no sign of foul play, and Ramirez noted that Carlos showed signs of a flulike illness. The Border Patrol turned over its surveillance video for review by police and the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy.
Dr. Norma Jean Farley served under contract with the county government. Her work on Carlos' case included reviewing the timeline presented in the cell video and examining photos of his body from the death scene. Her autopsy report listed the cause of death as Influenza A 2009 H1N1 respiratory infection complicated by bronchopneumonia, sepsis and an immune system disorder called hemophagocytosis.
Farley said in an interview that the video showed that no one entered Carlos' cell between 12:20 a.m., when he was fed, and around 6 a.m., when the cellmate knocked on the door to get an agent's attention.
Farley largely defended the Border Patrol's handling of the matter and questioned why Carlos did not do more to save himself.
""I was a little surprised that this kid, as sick as he was in the cell, never just knocked on the door as his roommate did, because as soon as the roommate did, they opened,"" Farley said. ""I just don't know why he didn't knock on the door.""
H1N1 flu has a typical incubation period of one to four days after exposure, and Carlos was in Border Patrol custody during that time. But Farley said she suspects Carlos may have had diarrhea caused by an immune disorder on his journey through Mexico, although there was no evidence of illness in his Border Patrol medical screening record.
""I'm finding what these people that tend to come there, they don't tell them that they're sick. And I don't know if they're afraid to tell them they're sick because they'll be quarantined. I don't know what the issue is that they don't. He finally did, but by the time he's telling them that he's sick, he's more sick than he knows,"" she said.
Questions remain about why Carlos' grave condition was not recognized by the nurse practitioners on May 19, or before, or during his hours at Weslaco. An agency spokeswoman said investigators are looking into ""all aspects of a case to ensure proper care procedures were followed.""
The Guatemalan government brought Carlos' body home to his village to wide television news coverage, its embassy calling on the U.S. to conduct a full investigation of his death. Thousands of mourners poured in from around the country to follow behind his casket, which was borne by soccer teammates down a long dirt road to the cemetery.
Pallbearers taped his royal blue No. 9 soccer jersey to the top of his casket as they laid it to rest. ""Maybe in all of his life, the 16 years that he was in this life, maybe he didn't do many things, but he did move us,"" said a speaker at his funeral. ""He touched hearts.""
Carlos' grief-stricken parents questioned how their son could have died in U.S. custody. His father, in an interview with Telemundo, wondered: ""He left healthy. What happened to him?""
Carlos' father, Bartolome Hernandez, said in a phone interview he will be glad to have answers from U.S. officials. ""They need to take better care of migrants,"" he said. ""The U.S. isn't a place where they should be allowing anyone to die like that.""
Pereira, Carlos' teacher, said that he believes the boy was abandoned in his cell. He had not seen the video but said ""If you have an animal that's sick and you've kept it in a room, every little while you're going to go check on it, see if it has water, whether it's shivering. That's with an animal. And this was a human being.""
In the months that have passed, lawyers at the Texas Civil Rights Project, a migrant advocacy group, have been in touch with Carlos' family and asked the CBP to preserve its records. They say that so far they have received little information about the death investigation.
Meanwhile, in Washington, moderate House Democrats joined Republicans in passing a bipartisan Senate bill sending $4.6 billion aid to the border on June 27. The impasse was broken a day after a heart-rending photograph went viral showing a drowned father and daughter lying face down on the banks of the Rio Grande.
The border situation has changed dramatically since Carlos' death. CBP now has 250 health staffers at its facilities across the Southwest, but Border Patrol cells have largely emptied out since July. The number of migrants crossing the border has declined sharply. The Trump administration has credited the decrease to more aggressive interdiction efforts by Mexico.
Adults and families crossing the border increasingly have been sent back to Mexico under the administration's controversial Migrant Protection Protocols program, which sends them to wait in dangerous Mexican border cities while U.S. courts consider their immigration and asylum claims.
The number of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the border was 2,800 in October, a quarter of what it was when Carlos arrived in May. Still, those who work with migrants on the ground say the numbers could swell again, and HHS is building out its shelter capacity from 15,000 beds to 20,000, with emergency influx facilities that can handle thousands more.
Questions about Carlos' death and whether agencies or individuals could have done more to prevent it have yet to be fully aired. CBP has not said when the DHS inspector general's review will be completed. Congressional committees that voiced concern about the spate of child deaths have not had access to the Carlos cell videos, pending internal agency reviews.
The death of the 16-year-old, whose Facebook page showed a circle of teenage friends, reverberated beyond the small village of San Jose del Rodeo. Friends posted video of his funeral and a village wake on social media, with emotional tributes to him. Guatemalan immigrants outside New York City held a fundraiser to help support his family, one of the goals Carlos had in coming to the U.S.
John Sanders resigned soon after the incident, frustrated with what he characterized as unprepared agencies and an unresponsive Congress that allowed children in custody to suffer in harsh conditions.
""I really think the American government failed these people. The government failed people like Carlos,"" he said. ""I was part of that system at a very high level, and Carlos' death will follow me for the rest of my life.""

8,/texas/across-tx/loophole-could-undermine-texas-law-against-surprise-medical-bills,2019-11-26T18:39:29Z,TX Law Against Surprise Medical Bills Undermined,0,0,Kaiser Health News,News Partner,"By Ashley Lopez, KUT (via Kaiser Health News)
Originally published on Monday, November 25
Texas' bipartisan effort to shield patients from surprise medical bills could be weaker than lawmakers intended when it takes effect Jan. 1.
Earlier this year, lawmakers from both parties came together on legislation to protect people in state-regulated health plans from getting outrageous bills for out-of-network care. The new law, known as Senate Bill 1264, creates an arbitration process for insurers and providers to negotiate fair prices in those cases. The intention of the law is to establish those fair prices without ever involving patients.
But that protection is at risk of becoming ""irrelevant,"" consumer advocates in Texas say.
""The financial struggle that legislators were trying to remove us from ― trying to protect us from ― patients might be right back in the middle of that situation,"" said Stacey Pogue, a senior policy analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities.
State agencies are writing the rules to implement and enforce the new law. Some of those rules, which will be discussed publicly in early December, will let hospitals and other care providers send patients bills in nonemergency situations, such as scheduled surgeries.
One state agency hashing out how the law will work is the Texas Medical Board, which is run by physicians and regulates other doctors in the state. Pogue said the board has proposed a rule that would expand the use of a narrow exception in the law. SB1264 created an exception for patients who knowingly want to receive nonemergency care from a doctor who is out of their health plan's network. In those cases, patients would sign a waiver with the expectation of paying those out-of-network costs.
The board's proposed rule takes that narrow exemption ― intended to be used only when patients want a particular out-of-network doctor ― and instead would require all out-of-network providers in nonemergency situations to give patients that waiver.
In practice, advocates say, the rule could essentially require out-of-network providers — like anesthesiologists and pathologists — to give patients a confusing form that waives their right to the new law's protection. The form would allow the patients to be balance-billed.
""Now it's a loophole,"" Pogue said. ""It's a loophole in the [law] where legislators wanted to give a protection ― a win-win. And now some patients are going to get a lose-lose.""
According to the Texas Medical Board, the proposed rules ""require an out-of-network provider to provide written notice and disclosure to a patient no less than 10 business days prior to the date of a nonemergency procedure.""
""The patient must have five business days to consider whether to accept, and may not agree prior to three business days after the notice was provided,"" Jarrett Schneider, a board spokesman, said in a statement. ""This allows for a cooling-off period so the patient has adequate time to decide whether to proceed if there are, in fact, out-of-network charges.""
Pogue said the rule also forces patients to choose between ""two terrible outcomes"" ― either paying more for providers they didn't choose or forgoing a needed medical procedure.
The proposed rules are expected to be discussed during the board's meeting early next month and could possibly be adopted at that time.
""It creates a path for any provider that wants to continue to send out-of-network bills [and] continue to balance-bill,"" Pogue said. ""It creates a pathway where they can do that.""
Schneider maintains that this is not the intent of the proposed rule.
""The Board's proposed rules do not waive any rights a patient has under Senate Bill 1264 or any statute,"" he said in a statement. ""The Board has put forward proposed rules that it believes provide patients with enough advance notice to make a reasoned, economic decision in regards to the care they are receiving.""
Jamie Dudensing, CEO of the Texas Association of Health Plans, said in a statement that he believes the proposed rule ""misinterprets the law's intent"" and makes surprise-billing protections weaker than they were before the law passed.
""Senate Bill 1264 has been praised as the strongest surprise billing law in the country — now we are in danger of making it almost completely irrelevant,"" Dudensing said. ""Instead of allowing for rare exceptions to surprise billing protections, the proposed rule would mandate the exception, resulting in patients losing all surprise billing protections in nonemergency situations.""
Blake Hutson, the associate director for the AARP of Texas, said he's most concerned that the rules are vague about how the waiver would work. He said the state has created a unique exception in an effort to give people more freedom in choosing doctors, but it has come with a lot of confusion.
""Other states that have addressed the surprise medical bill issues haven't created an exception for nonemergency, out-of-network physicians like we did,"" Hutson said.
Among Hutson's concerns are that the proposed rules do not make it clear that providers should mostly rely on the arbitration process set up under the new law to figure out payments. Instead, it requires them to use the proposed form, which various advocates say is hard to understand.
Hutson said the proposed waiver form also doesn't make it clear that patients don't have to sign it. And, he said, there's no clear process for what happens if patients refuse to sign the waiver. Hutson said the medical board should create a way to ensure people can still receive care even if they refuse to be balance-billed.
""This is totally fixable,"" Hutson said.
Advocates say they are worried that many of these concerns won't be dealt with during the rulemaking process, though, and instead will have to be addressed during the next state legislative session in 2021.
State Sen. Kelly Hancock, a Republican from North Richland Hills, sponsored SB1264. He said ""a rulemaking process that does not protect all patients … is not something we will be willing to accept."" Hancock said the intent of the legislation was to protect every Texan with state-regulated health insurance from getting balance-billed by any provider.
""We are trusting the process, but we are also verifying the process to make sure we get the end result we are looking for,"" Hancock said. ""And, frankly, what I think those who support the legislation voted for.""
State Rep. Tom Oliverson, a Republican from Cypress who co-sponsored the bill, said he's not as concerned as others about the proposed rules. He said the waiver process included in the bill was supposed to be something that was rarely used and he thinks the board's final rules will honor that.
Oliverson, who is an anesthesiologist in Texas, said he doesn't anticipate providers will abuse the waiver system.
""It was designed to be something that was seldom used, but we are not going to let it become a pathway to avoid the law,"" Oliverson said. ""And if it gets abused, we will come back in 2021 and get rid of it.""
Hancock said it is fairly unusual for bills to go through a rulemaking process this bumpy. He said he thinks this is happening because the stakes for this process are high for many entities who may have been relying on surprise billing as a source of income.
""We have no intentions of seeing the efforts and the intentions of legislators being ignored ― just because associations want to get things their way,"" he said.
Pogue said this situation is particularly disheartening because it was a bipartisan effort in Texas, a rare phenomenon.
""I haven't seen a bill with a scope this big ― that could be this meaningful for the financial security of a family — pass in the 12 years I have been doing this,"" Pogue said.
Hutson said SB1264 was ""painfully created"" and lawmakers took the time to find a compromise with both insurers and providers, which is no easy task.
""There's a lot of money in health care ― and so the different interests are going to use whatever they can to collect money on the backs of consumers wherever they can, unfortunately,"" Hutson said. ""It's frustrating.""

9,/texas/across-tx/despite-supreme-court-win-texas-abortion-clinics-still-shuttered,2019-11-19T19:14:31Z,"Despite Court Win, TX Abortion Clinics Shuttered",0,0,Kaiser Health News,News Partner,"By Ashley Lopez, KUT (via Kaiser Health News)
Originally published on Monday, November 18
Over the past few years, abortion providers in Texas have struggled to reopen clinics that had closed because of restrictive state laws.
There were more than 40 clinics providing abortion in Texas on July 12, 2013 — the day lawmakers approved tough new restrictions and rules for clinics.
Even though abortion providers fought those restrictions all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and managed to get the restrictions overturned in 2016, most of the affected clinics remain closed.
Today, just 22 clinics are open in a state that is home to 29 million people.
Although abortion providers won the legal battle, they appear to be losing the war. Most clinics are clustered in the major cities of Dallas, Houston and Austin, while women who live in smaller cities and towns that once had clinics now have to travel long distances for an abortion.
The West Texas town of San Angelo, for example, once had a Planned Parenthood clinic, but it had to close in 2013. It had been one of the last abortion providers in the sprawling, dry and mostly rural region, where most residents must drive at least three hours to reach a major city.
Susanne Fernandez, who worked at the San Angelo clinic for almost 30 years, gets emotional talking about its closure. ""I loved working for Planned Parenthood.""
Fernandez blamed the closure on the 2013 state law, known as House Bill 2, which required abortion clinics to have the same sort of equipment, standards and staffing as surgical centers — and also required the doctors performing abortions to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. She said complying with those rules would have been extremely difficult and expensive. Still, the decision to close the San Angelo clinic was tough.
""The last day was sad. It was somber,"" Fernandez said. ""We did a lot of cleaning up. We all knew that was it.""
Abortion providers in Texas eventually sued the state. But as the legal challenge worked its way through the courts, many of the clinics were forced to stop providing services.
At one point, Texas had only 17 clinics, said Kari White, an investigator with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project at the University of Texas-Austin. She said women living in rural Texas were affected the most.
""What we saw is that [in] West Texas and South Texas, access was incredibly limited,"" White said, ""and women living in those parts of the state were more than 100 miles — sometimes 200 or more miles — from the nearest facility.""
White's research team conducted surveys and interviews with women who were seeking abortions as clinics were shutting down. A 19-year-old woman told the researchers she considered giving up because it was so hard to find an open clinic.
""It was a very hard thing to do, like to keep calling and calling and calling,"" the woman told researchers. ""I almost was like, you know, 'Well, forget it.' … But then, because I knew at the end of the day it was something that I had to do, it was like 'I don't care how many people I have to call or how far I have to go. I have to do it.'""
That woman eventually found a clinic 70 miles away and was able to get the abortion. But in some other cases, women carried unwanted pregnancies to term.
Texas law requires women to have two appointments with an abortion provider. After an initial appointment at a clinic, they must wait 24 hours before getting the procedure. That means women often have to make a long trip at least twice, or pay for a hotel nearby. The waiting period is waived only if a woman lives more than 100 miles from the closest clinic.
A 23-year-old woman from Waco, a married mother of two, told researchers she made appointments to get an abortion at two clinics. But both appointments were canceled after the clinics were forced to close. She was unable to end the pregnancy.
""I was pretty upset, but I just decided that I guess I'll have to just ride it out,"" she told researchers. ""I didn't know what else to do, who else to call.""
Eventually, in the summer of 2016 — three years after H.B. 2 passed — the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the tough new restrictions on clinics. But most of the clinics never reopened.
""There hasn't been this rush of clinics reopening following the Supreme Court decision,"" White said. ""So there are still just clinics concentrated in the major metropolitan areas of Texas.""
The ruling has also been a mixed bag for anti-abortion activists, said John Seago, the legislative director for Texas Right to Life.
""The closures of clinics is definitely a victory for the movement, obviously,"" he said. ""However, how are we in this situation in the first place is what my organization looks at.""
Seago pointed to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that made abortion legal in the U.S. He said anti-abortion activists fight legal battles on the state level in an effort to reverse Roe, and the Supreme Court ruling on Texas' law was a big blow to the larger goal of slowly dismantling Roe.
Some New Options In Recent Years
Over the past three years, a few abortion providers have decided to open clinics in Texas.
For example, earlier this year Kathy Kleinfeld opened a new abortion clinic in Houston — a city that already had a few clinics providing abortion.
Kleinfeld, a longtime consultant for abortion providers in Texas and other states, decided to open in Houston after carefully looking at the demand for services in that region. Her clinic provides medical abortions using pills, but not surgical abortions.
""Due to the closure of so many clinics, the remaining clinics that are open are very busy, and they are very strict in the scheduling,"" Kleinfeld said. ""So our goal was to offer flexibility in scheduling.""
Kleinfeld said her clinic could help take some pressure off the remaining clinics in Houston. She said so far her patients have been professionals, students and women who drive over from Louisiana.
But she emphasized that getting her clinic up and running was not easy, despite her intimate knowledge of the complex rules and mandatory paperwork and the surprise inspections involved in operating as a licensed abortion provider in Texas.
Kleinfeld predicted that opening and running a clinic, and keeping it open, will always be difficult in Texas.
""There's always been volatility and conflict and struggles,"" she said. ""Always. And this is not for the faint of heart.""
Andrea Ferrigno agrees with that assessment. As the corporate vice president of Whole Woman's Health, Ferrigno helps operate several clinics that offer abortion in Texas.
She recalls that after H.B. 2 passed in 2013, Whole Woman's Health was forced to close two clinics — one in Austin and another in Beaumont, a small city near the Louisiana border. So far, Whole Woman's Health has been able to reopen only the Austin clinic.
""It's basically starting from scratch,"" Ferrigno said. ""You laid off the staff; you don't have any physicians that work there anymore. Some of the doctors didn't even renew their physician licenses.""
Ferrigno said clinics that closed may have lost the state-issued license needed to operate. Applying for a new one is a significant bureaucratic hurdle. Some clinics might have lost their leases and been forced to vacate their buildings and sell off equipment.
""There are a lot of different limitations,"" she said. ""There's also the question of — or the fear of — security challenges. People picketing the clinic, picketing their homes. There's a lot that goes into that.""
But the cost of not reopening — particularly in a community that had only one clinic to begin with — may be high.
Take San Angelo, for example: Fernandez said she doubts a clinic offering abortions will open in her town anytime soon. She sometimes wonders what happened to the women she used to help.
""Where did these women go? Where do they go now?"" Fernandez said. ""I don't believe a lot of them found any other health care afterwards.""

10,/texas/across-tx/supreme-court-weighs-whether-tx-border-patrol-can-be-sued-mexican-teens-deaths,2019-11-15T15:13:18Z,Court Weighs Whether Border Patrol Can Be Sued,0,0,Cronkite News,News Partner,"By Harrison Mantas, Cronkite News
Originally published Tuesday, November 11
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Supreme Court justices appeared split Tuesday on whether the family of a Mexican teen who was shot across the border and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Texas can sue the agent.
A court in Texas said the family could not, but another court in a nearly identical case in Nogales said the Mexican parents could sue for the death of their teen son in a 2012 cross-border shooting.
The Nogales case was not strictly under consideration Tuesday, but the court's ruling in the case of Hernandez v. Mesa, is expected to affect both. And Araceli Rodriguez, the mother in the Nogales case, was in Washington to watch Tuesday's hearing.
Chief Justice John Roberts asked an attorney for the family in the Texas case whether courts would be stepping into U.S. foreign policy by allowing a lawsuit that could reach a finding that conflicted with the government's diplomatic policy.
But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked how letting the case proceed against ""a rogue officer acting in violation of the agency's own instruction, using excessive force to kill a child at play. How does that call into question any foreign policy or national security policy?""
The first case began in 2010, when 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was playing a game with friends along a concrete ditch near the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico that involved running up to the American side and touching the border fence before running back to the Mexican side.
Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa claims he told the boys to stop, and only fired after they began throwing rocks at him. Hernandez was hiding behind a concrete pillar when he was hit in the face and died on the Mexican side of the border.
An investigation by Border Patrol determined that Mesa's actions were justified, sparking the civil suit by the Hernandez family. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has twice rejected that suit, first ruling that Mesa enjoyed immunity for his actions then – after that ruling was sent back by the Supreme Court in 2017 – that Sergio did not enjoy Fourth Amendment protections as a foreign citizen on foreign soil.
According to court documents, Jose Antonio Rodriguez, 16, was walking on the Mexican side of the border in Nogales in October 2012 when Border Patrol Agent Lonnie Swartz fired 14 to 30 bullets across the border, 10 of which hit the teenager in the back, killing him.
Swartz claimed he was acting in self-defense and in November 2018, a federal jury in Tucson found him not guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
-Cronkite News video by Heather Cumberledge
But while the 5th Circuit rejected the Hernandez family's claim, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2018 said the Rodriguez case could go forward – relying in part on the Supreme Court's first decision in the Texas case.
Stephen Vladeck, the attorney for the Hernandez family, based his case on a 1971 Supreme Court case that he said allowed people to bring financial claims against the government for violations of their constitutional rights.
But Justice Neil Gorsuch asked whether extending that right to non-citizens on foreign soil would run the risk of, say, putting U.S. service members in jeopardy for their actions.
""I can think of a lot of cases that's going to encompass, right?"" Gorsuch asked of the possible impact of such a ruling. ""And not just cross-border shootings, but all kinds of torts that can occur transnationally…. It can't be that this is good for one shooting only, right?""
Randolph Ortega, the lawyer representing Mesa, argued allowing these cases to go forward would extend the Constitution's protections beyond the U.S. border in an arbitrary way that would create chaos for the court.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked whether the court should consider the extension anyway given the fact these families have no other legal remedy to address their claims against what was descried in the hearing as a ""rogue officer acting in violation of the agency's own instruction.""
Ortega responded that it would be better for Congress to make that determination than the courts.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked both Ortega and Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall why these claims are different from any other civil suit handled by U.S. courts. Wall said these cross-border shootings are a source of friction between the U.S. and Mexican governments, and that having the courts decide them would undercut diplomatic efforts to resolve them.
The court is not expected to issue a ruling until next year. But Araceli Rodriguez, speaking through a translator, said she wants the border patrol agents to know the families will never stop looking for justice.

11,/texas/across-tx/mom-vs-texas-fight-get-kids-hearing-aids-covered,2019-11-14T19:06:05Z,Mom Vs. Texas In A Fight To Get Kids’ Hearing Aids,0,0,Kaiser Health News,News Partner,"By Dan Weissmann, Kaiser Health News
When Stephanie Wittels Wachs found out that health insurance in Texas didn't cover hearing aids for kids, she lobbied to change Texas law. And she won. But the process took more than two years.
""You're constantly just like bugging everyone you know, like, 'Please call! Please text! Please call! Please email!'"" Wittels Wachs said. ""You just become like this broken record.""
It was a grind, but along the way, Wittels Wachs found surprising allies. The bill's sponsor in the state Senate was Lois Kolkhorst, a deep-red Republican with family members who are deaf.
""You end up getting into bed with people who, you're like, 'They're the worst!' But you find out they're not the worst,"" Wittels Wachs said.
Season 3's Episode 1 of ""An Arm And A Leg"" unveils the moment when Sen. Kolkhorst made an emotional pitch to her fellow lawmakers. It worked. Texas now requires health plans to cover medically necessary hearing aids and cochlear implants for children.
Wittels Wachs has a daughter born hearing-impaired, and she was shocked to learn that the hearing aids her daughter needed would cost $6,000, and not be covered by her health insurance.
But her activism didn't come from financial need; it came after a personal tragedy. Wittels Wachs' brother, Harris Wittels — a comic who wrote for TV comedies like ""Parks and Recreation"" — died of a heroin overdose around the time Wittels Wachs' daughter turned 1 year old.
""I just needed a place to put a lot of my inability to bring my brother back, my inability to change the fact that my daughter couldn't hear,"" Wittels Wachs said. ""All of these things happened at once that I couldn't fix.""
Wittels Wachs is the host of ""Last Day,"" a new podcast about the opioid crisis and the author of ""Everything Is Horrible and Wonderful,"" a memoir about grieving her brother.

12,/texas/across-tx/texas-facing-retiree-health-care-crisis,2019-11-05T20:06:51Z,Texas facing retiree health care crisis,0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"The public pension crisis has been a staple in the news cycle for the last decade. Headlines feature scary stories of firefighters being laid off and teachers on strike trying to secure better retirement benefits. State and local governments have promised these benefits to public workers, but have set aside less than 72 cents on average for every dollar of promised pension benefits. Now that number may not scare some of you because 72 percent would have been considered passing in grade school. But what the newspapers and others have failed to notice is the growing crisis of other post-employment benefits (OPEB), otherwise known as retiree health care.
Along with a pension, many government workers are also promised free or heavily subsidized health care when they retire. However, Truth in Accounting's most recent report found that the 50 states have less than seven cents set aside to pay for every dollar of promised OPEB. Seven percent is nowhere near passing.
Texas, for example, is one of eight states that has significantly more OPEB debt than pension debt, yet the most recent articles on Texas' finances feature only stories about the state's pension crisis. Texas owes $71.45 billion in unfunded OPEB promises, which is 22 percent more than what the state owes in unfunded pension benefits.
State and local governments have long hidden retirement benefit obligations, including pensions and OPEB, off their balance sheets. In fiscal year (FY) 2018, however, the most recent fiscal year, state and local governments that use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles were required to report their unfunded liabilities related to other post-employment benefits.
Since 2009, Truth in Accounting (TIA) has been reporting the amount of all state unfunded retirement liabilities, despite the fact that those numbers were not counted on state government balance sheets. Maybe now that they've appeared the balance sheets, the media and others will start paying attention.

13,/texas/across-tx/energy-chief-rick-perry-asked-testify-impeachment-inquiry,2019-11-02T23:05:59Z,Impeachment Probe: Perry Asked To Testify,0,1,Associated Press,News Partner,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House investigators have called Energy Secretary Rick Perry to testify in the impeachment inquiry and issued subpoenas late Friday to a top White House lawyer and another administration official to appear.
Perry is the first member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet asked to appear before the House. His testimony is scheduled for Wednesday, according to an official working on the impeachment inquiry. The person was unauthorized to discuss it and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes indicated Friday that Perry would not appear for the closed-door hearing but would consider testifying in a public session. Perry has already defied a subpoena from the committees for Ukraine-related documents.
""The Secretary will not partake in a secret star chamber inquisition where agency counsel is forbidden to be present,"" Hynes said.
""If the committee is interested in conducting a serious proceeding they are welcome to send for the Secretary's consideration an invitation to participate in an open hearing where the Department's counsel can be present and the American people can witness,"" she said.
The subpoenas were issued to two White House officials who have already been asked to appear Monday.
One subpoena is for testimony from John Eisenberg, the lead counsel at the National Security Council, according to another person familiar with the situation, who was also unauthorized to discuss it. Eisenberg was instrumental in discussions about how to handle a White House memo recounting the Trump phone call with Ukraine that is central to the impeachment inquiry.
The House impeachment inquiry is turning to Eisenberg as investigators learn more about the concerns other officials at the White House raised with him about the Trump administration's actions toward Ukraine.
The impeachment inquiry stems from Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy when he asked for a ""favor"" — to investigate Democrats and a company linked to the family of Joe Biden — as the White House was withholding military aid to the Eastern European ally as it confronts Russian aggression.
Eisenberg was among the White House lawyers privy to a discussion about moving the memo of Trump's phone call into a highly restricted computer system normally reserved for documents about covert action. The White House eventually released a rough transcript of the call amid a government whistleblower's complaint about it.
In testimony behind closed doors this week, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert, told investigators he twice brought his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel , presumably Eisenberg, about the call and related administration actions toward the country.
Another White House official who testified before the impeachment investigators, Tim Morrison, the Russia expert at NSC, said he, too, contacted the NSC legal office about the call, not because of any concerns it was illegal but because he was worried about how a potential leak to the public would ""play out in Washington's polarized environment.""
The other subpoena is to Brian McCormack, who works on energy policy at the Office of Management and Budget. McCormack is Perry's former chief of staff.
Trump has blocked White House officials from testifying in the impeachment probe, which he views as illegitimate.
But an ever-growing list of current and former administration staffers has been appearing behind closed doors in the impeachment hearings.
Investigators also want to hear Wednesday from David Hale, an undersecretary at the State Department who has been mentioned in previous testimony.
Mostly, the witnesses are corroborating the core of the investigation: that Trump wanted Zelenskiy for the investigation of Democrats and the company linked to Biden's son Hunter, while administration withheld military aid.
Democrats see the actions as a quid pro quo, trading government policy and funding for a political favor. Trump said he did nothing wrong.
Perry, who led a U.S. delegation to Ukraine for Zelenskiy's inauguration in May, has emphatically denied hearing anyone, during his frequent meetings with Ukrainian officials, mention the Bidens or the Ukraine company that employed Hunter Biden.
Perry told the AP in Dubai last weekend that he considered the way lawmakers were pursuing impeachment improper and indicated he did not plan to testify.
The House voted this week to affirm the impeachment process and formalize the procedures ahead.

14,/texas/across-tx/rick-perry-former-tx-governor-resign-energy-secretary,2019-10-18T14:27:17Z,Rick Perry To Resign From Trump Admin ,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced Thursday that he will leave his job by the end of the year, saying that under President Donald Trump the nation is nearing energy independence.
Perry's long-rumored departure comes as he is under scrutiny over the role he played in the president's dealings with Ukraine, the focus of an ongoing impeachment inquiry.
In a letter to Trump, Perry made no mention of Ukraine and exalted policy successes that have led to increased production and exports of oil and natural gas.
""The U.S. private sector is leading the world in energy production, exploration and exports,"" Perry said. ""Today, when the world looks for energy, they can now think of America first.""
Trump said Perry ""has done a fantastic job"" at Energy, ""but it was time"" for him to leave.
Perry, 69, a former Texas governor, has been energy secretary since March 2017, making him one of the longest-serving members of Trump's Cabinet, which has seen huge turnover.
He was traveling with Trump to Texas when he notified the president of his decision aboard Air Force One.
Trump told reporters he ""knew six months ago"" that Perry wanted to leave by the end of the year.
""He's got some ideas for doing something else. He's a terrific guy,"" Trump said.
Trump said he already knows who will succeed Perry, but declined to identify the person.
House Democrats have subpoenaed Perry for documents related to a Ukrainian state-owned energy company as well as his involvement in a July call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The lawmakers set a Friday deadline.
Trump has said Perry teed up the July 25 call, in which Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son, who was employed by a Ukrainian gas company.
A spokeswoman for Perry has said he wanted Trump to speak with the Ukrainian leader on energy matters related to U.S. efforts to boost Western energy ties to Eastern Europe. It is part of a long-term effort to lessen the political control Russia wields through its dominance of the fuel supply.
The Associated Press reported this month that a circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted their connections to Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as they sought to install new management at the top of Ukraine's state-owned gas company last spring.
The plan hit a snag after Zelinskiy's election, but Perry took up the effort to install a friendlier management team at the company, Naftogaz. Perry attended Zelinskiy's May 2019 inauguration as the administration's senior representative and met privately with Zelinskiy. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Perry had disputed published reports that he was planning to leave the administration. He told a news conference in Lithuania earlier this month: ""One of these days they will probably get it right. But it's not today, it's not tomorrow, not next month. Keep saying it and one day you'll be right.""
Perry, who twice ran for president before taking the job at Energy, has kept a relatively low-profile in his 2 ½-year tenure. He has supported Trump's call for ""energy dominance"" around the world and pushed to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants. He said last year that a rash of coal and nuclear retirements was ""alarming"" and posed a looming crisis for the nation's power grid.
""If unchecked, (the plant closures) will threaten our ability to recover from intentional attacks and natural disasters,"" Perry said at a speech in Texas.
Trump, who has frequently promised to bring back coal jobs, directed Perry in June 2018 to take ""immediate steps"" to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants to keep them open, calling it a matter of national and economic security.
No definitive action has been taken since then. A regional transmission organization that oversees the power grid in 13 Eastern and Midwestern states said there's no immediate threat to system reliability.
Perry has won plaudits from lawmakers for an easygoing style that reflects a life in politics, and he has frequently distanced himself from severe budget cuts to energy programs sought by the White House. He has toured Energy Department sites around the country, represented the Trump administration at meetings overseas and begun a years-long process to revive a shuttered nuclear waste dump at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.
Before taking the Energy job, Perry had been subjected to widespread ridicule after forgetting the name of an agency he pledged to eliminate as president. That agency was the Energy Department. Despite that, Perry has emerged as a strong defender of the department's work, especially the 17 national labs that conduct cutting-edge research on everything from national security to renewable energy.
""I'm telling you officially the coolest job I've ever had is being secretary of Energy ... and it's because of these labs,"" Perry told employees at the Idaho National Laboratory in 2017.
Trump denied reports that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott or Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy could replace Perry, but said, ""They would both be very good.""

15,/texas/across-tx/ex-texas-rep-sessions-subpoenaed-giuliani-grand-jury-probe,2019-10-16T15:12:10Z,Pete Sessions Subpoenaed In Giuliani Probe,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"WASHINGTON — A federal grand jury has subpoenaed former Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions for information about his interactions with Rudy Giuliani and several associates who were indicted last week.
The former lawmaker from Texas is cooperating with investigators and will turn over documents in the coming weeks, said Matt Mackowiak, a spokesman for Sessions.
The subpoena is part of an ongoing investigation based in New York that includes an inquiry into the business dealings of Giuliani, according to a person familiar with the probe. The person wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, is the personal attorney to President Donald Trump.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the Sessions subpoena, said it specifically sought documents related to Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine and his efforts to oust the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, as well as information about interactions between Sessions, Giuliani and four men who were indicted in the Southern District of New York.
Those men include two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who are associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. They were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations in connection with a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump's reelection.
The federal investigation comes as House Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine, including a summertime phone call in which he pressed Ukraine's president to investigate baseless corruption allegations against Democrat Joe Biden. Giuliani had also been asking Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Biden and also pushed for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.
Prosecutors allege Parnas urged a congressman to promote efforts to push out Yovanovitch around the same time that Parnas and Fruman committed to raising more than $20,000 for the politician.
The congressman wasn't identified in court papers, but the donations match campaign finance reports for Sessions, who lost his reelection bid in November. In May 2018, Parnas posted a photo of himself and his business partner David Correia — who was also named in the indictment — with Sessions in his Capitol Hill office, with the caption ""Hard at work!!""
Sessions spent 22 years in Congress, becoming a powerful Republican voice and the muscle behind the GOP's House takeover of 2010.
Earlier this month, Sessions announced an attempted comeback in his boyhood hometown of Waco, about 100 miles south of Dallas, running for a seat being vacated by Rep. Bill Flores, one of six Texas GOP congressmen retiring next year.

The report is based on the states' 2018 comprehensive annual financial reports, the most recent data available.
The analysis by Truth in Accounting, a non-profit government finance watchdog group, found Texas needs $98.7 billion to get out of the red, or $12,100 from each of its taxpayers.
Texas and other states have become more transparent over the last few years, thanks to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which now require governments to disclose pension and other post-employment (OPEB) benefits on their balance sheets. If these benefits have not been fully funded, they are considered liabilities, or debt, because they represent money owed to government employees in their retirement.
According to the watchdog's tenth annual Financial State of the States report, Texas has $179.9 billion in bills and only $81.3 billion in available assets to pay those bills after capital and restricted assets are excluded. This results in a $98.7 billion shortfall, or a $12,100 Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of the state debt after the state's available assets have been tapped. TIA's Taxpayer Burden indicator incorporates both assets and liabilities, including unfunded retirement obligations.
The bottom line is that Texas does not have enough money to pay its bills, which is why it received a ""D"" grade for its fiscal health.

17,/texas/across-tx/stephen-barbee-execution-halted-consider-scotus-precedent,2019-09-24T14:54:51Z,Stephen Barbee Execution Halted,0,0,Feroze Dhanoa,Patch Staff,"By Jolie McCullough, The Texas Tribune
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Monday halted the execution of Stephen Barbee. He had been set to die Oct. 2.
Barbee, 52, was sentenced to death in Tarrant County in the 2005 murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Lisa Underwood, and her 7-year-old son, Jayden. According to court records, Barbee initially confessed during police interrogation to killing them because he feared Underwood would tell his wife that he was likely the father of her unborn child and that he would have to pay child support. He later recanted the confession, which his lawyer argues was ""the product of fear and coercion,"" and has since maintained his innocence.
The Texas court stopped next week's execution because Barbee's attorneys at his short, two-and-a-half day trial, admitted his guilt, likely in an attempt to secure the more favorable sentence of life in prison without the opportunity for parole. Barbee has said this concession of guilt after he pleaded not guilty was against his wishes, that he repeatedly told his lawyers he wanted to maintain his innocence and that his lawyers' statement was ""a complete surprise.""
""Texas court halts the execution of Stephen Barbee to consider U.S. Supreme Court precedent"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
The concession, Barbee argues, is a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The argument was rejected earlier, but after a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision out of Louisiana, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered further review of the case.
In McCoy v. Louisiana, the high court ruled that ""a defendant has the right to insist that counsel refrain from admitting guilt, even when counsel's experienced-based view is that confessing guilt offers the defendant the best chance to avoid the death penalty."" Although other Texas death penalty appeals have raised the ruling unsuccessfully, the state appellate court decided Barbee's case requires an opinion on the McCoy case's reach.
The Court of Criminal Appeals asked for the prosecution and Barbee to file briefs within 30 days of Monday's ruling to debate the issues raised in their latest filings on whether he qualifies for relief under the Supreme Court decision.
Tarrant County prosecutors argued that McCoy should not apply to Barbee because there was no record of him objecting to the concession of guilt, which the top Texas court recently said was necessary in a McCoy appeal. They also said Barbee didn't testify to claim his innocence. Barbee's appellate attorney, Richard Ellis, said his client could not object before the admission of guilt because he was unaware it was going to be given.
After his initial confession, Barbee argued that the another defendant in the case, his co-worker Ron Dodd, committed the murders alone and that he helped Dodd conceal the bodies. Barbee's lawyers admitted that they decided to argue that Barbee accidentally committed the murders, as he originally said, because ""the 'Ron Dodd did it' theory just wasn't going to work,"" according to Barbee's latest filing.
In their order, the state judges said they will discuss and decide whether McCoy can be applied retroactively to convictions handed down before the high court's ruling, whether the ruling can apply to cases in which a defendant previously confessed, and if there must be evidence in the trial record that the defendant objected to the lawyer's strategy to concede guilt.
Ellis said Monday afternoon he was pleased with the appeals court ruling but noted that the court didn't yet overturn Barbee's conviction and grant him a new trial, which is what he ultimately has requested.
""We're hoping that this gives the Court of Criminal Appeals the opportunity to rule that this is a fundamental right,"" he said of denying guilt concessions.
Barbee's execution was the third stopped by the Court of Criminal Appeals this year. Federal courts stopped three other scheduled executions. Six men have been executed in Texas in 2019, and eight more are scheduled for execution through December, including Robert Sparks on Wednesday.

18,/texas/across-tx/texas-retiree-health-care-severely-underfunded,2019-09-20T15:56:38Z,Texas retiree health care severely underfunded,0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"In fiscal year (FY) 2018, the most recent fiscal year, state and local governments that use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles were required to report their unfunded liabilities related to other post-employment benefits (OPEB). OPEB comprises mainly retiree health care benefits. State and local governments have long hid retirement benefit obligations, including pensions and OPEB, off their balance sheets.
Since 2009, Truth in Accounting (TIA) has been reporting the amount of state unfunded retirement liabilities, despite the fact that those numbers were not counted on state government balance sheets. In TIA's most recent report, it found that the 50 states have less than seven cents set aside to pay every dollar of promised OPEB.
Several states have not set any money aside to pay for OPEB, including Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Tennessee, Washington, Wyoming, Illinois, and Vermont. The average funding ratio for the 50 states in FY 2018 was 18.5 percent, which is up from less than seven percent in 2009.
Texas's OPEB plans are only 1.07 percent funded. Texas, like many others, treats OPEB on a pay-as-you-go basis, whereby benefits are paid when retirees receive the health care. This leaves future taxpayers stuck paying for OPEB benefits earned by current employees, although those future taxpayers will receive no government services or benefits for the taxes that go to pay these benefits. Even worse, state retirees are counting on these promised benefits that have not been funded.

19,/texas/across-tx/brass-knuckles-other-self-defense-items-will-be-legal-texas,2019-08-29T19:25:14Z,Self-Defense Items Will Be Legal Sept. 1,0,0,Feroze Dhanoa,Patch Staff,"By Riane Roldan, The Texas Tribune
Had one north Texas woman not gotten into a fender bender last year, police might have never arrested her for carrying a cat-shaped self-defense keychain in her purse, and the law banning those same weapons might have gone unnoticed.
State Rep. Joe Moody, a Democrat from El Paso, filed legislation lifting what he called an ""antiquated"" ban on brass knuckles last session, which the governor signed in May. The key chain — with pointy blades for ears — could have cost Kyli Phillips, who was 21 and living in Dallas at the time, $4,000 in fines and a year of jail time if she had been convicted of the misdemeanor. In late July, lawyers dismissed the case against her and canceled an upcoming court date.
Starting Sunday, when the law takes effect, brass knuckles will be legal in Texas for the first time since 1918.
In 2017, law enforcement convicted 93 people of possessing brass knuckles, according to The Dallas Morning News. Moody, a former prosecutor, said the law is often used to target young people of color.
The laws ""are relics of the system that we need to turn away from,"" he said. ""We're taking something out of the code that has a large potential for misuse.""
""Brass knuckles and other self-defense items will be legal in Texas starting Sept. 1"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
The Texas Penal Code defines knuckles as ""any instrument that consists of finger rings or guards made of a hard substance and that is designed, made, or adapted for the purpose of inflicting serious bodily injury or death by striking a person with a fist enclosed in the knuckles."" They are included on a list of lethal weapons like explosives, machine guns and armor-piercing ammunition.
Supporters of House Bill 446 said that Texans carrying knuckles and other legitimate self-defense tools shouldn't face jail time.
""If someone has a novelty item or a legitimate self-defense tool, we really shouldn't be prosecuting them for that,"" Moody said. ""That's not a good use of resources.""
Lawmakers have been rolling back weapons bans for the past few legislative sessions.
In 2017, Moody sponsored a bill that eliminated a 145-year-old state ban on carrying knives in public, making it possible for people to carry anything from a dagger to a machete. And in 2013, legislators removed switchblades from the banned weapons list.

20,/texas/across-tx/what-would-happen-if-voter-turnout-improved,2020-07-30T14:04:30Z,What would happen if the voter turnout improved?,0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"With the 2020 presidential election upon us, activists of both political parties are urging voters to hit the polls. There has been an increasing trend among citizens of forgoing their vote, especially in states in which the majority vote is predictable. Many of these Americans either don't care much for politics or struggle to find the time to cast their vote. The real question is what level of voting power is the country missing out on and how much of a difference could it really make in electing the next president?
The graph above shows the five states with the lowest voter turnout rate, which is below 55 percent of each state's total voter population. These five states are Hawaii (47.3 percent voter turnout rate), New Mexico (54.8 percent), Tennessee (54 percent), Texas (55.4 percent), and West Virginia (50.8 percent). These states only account for a small fraction of the total number of votes being missed out on, but the amount of people not voting in these states sums to about 40 million Americans. Needless to say, getting more of these Americans to vote could very well change the course of the election for either side.
In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won by what seemed to be a whopping 77 electoral votes; however, he lost the popular vote by about three million. The Data-Z chart above reveals that the five states with the lowest voter turnout rate in the country total 63 electoral votes. The entire progression of the election could change by properly educating voters and persuading the unheard voices of Americans to stand behind a candidate.

21,/texas/across-tx/u-s-rep-louie-gohmert-mask-skeptic-tests-positive-coronavirus-according-reports,2020-07-29T15:41:52Z,"U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, A Mask Skeptic, Tests...",0,0,Texas Tribune,News Partner,"By Alex Samuels, The Texas Tribune July 29, 2020
U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, has tested positive for the new coronavirus, he said in an interview with East Texas Now where he speculated that he may have caught the virus from wearing his mask.
Gohmert, who spends ample time on the U.S. House floor without a mask, was one of several Texas officials scheduled to fly to West Texas this afternoon with President Donald Trump. He took one test, which tested positive, then took a second test during a pre-screen at the White House which also tested positive.
""I can't help but wonder ... if I injected the virus into my mask when I was moving,"" he said in an interview.
""U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a mask skeptic, tests positive for coronavirus"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
Medical experts and doctors overwhelmingly recommend wearing masks as a way to reduce spread of COVID-19. Recent research suggests that masks could protect the wearer from severe symptoms of COVID-19 or from catching the virus entirely.
Gohmert, 66, was one of several lawmakers who participated in a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee that also took place Tuesday. He walked around the hearing room and outside without wearing a mask. News of his diagnosis was first reported by Politico and later confirmed by ABC News.
""I'm fine. I feel fine. Totally asymptomatic,"" he said. ""If I hadn't been going with the president, since I don't feel badly, I would never have known.""
Gohmert said he received guidance from the doctors at the White House and the attending physician at the Capitol that he only needed to self-quarantine for 10 days. He said he will drive back to his East Texas home and that his staff is all getting tested for the virus.
""Like Dorothy said, there's no place like home,"" Gohmert said.
According to CNN, U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, was seated next to Gohmert on a flight from Texas on Sunday evening. She is also self-quarantining, according to her office.
The Republican lawmaker has been known for speaking at length with Capitol colleagues while not adhering to social distancing guidelines. Last month, he told CNN that he was not wearing a mask because he was getting tested regularly for the virus.
""I don't have the coronavirus, turns out as of yesterday I've never had it,"" he said in June. ""But if I get it, you'll never see me without a mask.""
Gohmert also raised eyebrows in March after returning to the Capitol despite potential exposure to the virus at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Though he said at the time he was cleared by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention physician to resume Capitol business, other lawmakers who attended the conference, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, opted to self-quarantine.
Several other members of Congress have tested positive for the deadly respiratory virus. Kentucky Republican Rand Paul tested positive for the virus in March and later recovered. Florida Republican Reps. Neal Dunn and Mario Diaz-Balart have also contracted the virus.
Texas, however, has recently become a hotspot for the coronavirus, with the state having some of the highest case counts in the nation. The governor previously issued a statewide mask mandate.
In a tweet Wednesday morning, U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, who chaired Tuesday's hearing, wished Gohmert ""a full & speedy recovery.""
""When individuals refuse to take the necessary precautions it puts everyone at risk,"" he wrote. ""I've regularly instructed all Members to wear their masks and hope this is a lesson by all my colleagues.""

22,/texas/across-tx/wealthy-retired-are-flocking-these-five-states,2020-07-15T16:09:55Z,The Wealthy and Retired are Flocking to these...,0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"For this year's delayed Tax Day, we're taking a look at new IRS data. Each year, the IRS reports the migration of tax returns, exemptions and Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for each state. This data measures the inflow and outflow of residents moving between states based on the number of returns filed and gives the AGI of different income and age groups that migrate. At Data-Z, we have calculated the net AGI gain or loss for each state by taking the difference between inflow returns and outflow returns. According to our calculations, the five states with the highest net Adjusted Gross Income inmigration in 2018 were Florida, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
In four of these five states, incoming residents between the ages of 55 and 65 brought in the largest percentage, representing over 29 percent of Florida's incoming AGI. Texas was one exception where millenials between 26 and 35 had the highest percentage at 25 percent. As for highest AGI gain, Florida was the most successful at attracting residents and income, bringing a net AGI inmigration of $16.5 billion, with Texas and Arizona coming next with $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion. North and South Carolina followed with $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.
These five states had a combined AGI inmigration of over $29 billion, while the biggest net losers, New York, Illinois, California, New Jersey and Maryland, had a combined AGI outmigration of $28.3 billion. So why did these five winning states perform so well in comparison to much larger, popular states? One thing these five states have in common is their location in the southern United States; they also all have a relatively low cost of living. The chart below shows that in all the states that lost the most AGI, except for Illinois, it would take well over $100 to purchase $100 of goods and services. (The ""value of $100"" measure is used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to allow ""comparisons of buying power across the 50 states and the District of Columbia, or from one metro area to another, for a given year."")
The chart below shows the average winter temperatures for January to March 2020. All five of the loser states had average winter temperatures below 45 degrees Fahrenheit, while four of the five winning states had average winter temperatures above 45 degrees. Of course temperatures vary over time, but it is safe to say that those five southern states are reliably warmer than the more northern states.
There may, however, be another, more important incentive to new residents: the tax structure in these areas. Florida and Texas do not have a state income tax, while Arizona and North Carolina have modest maximum income tax rates of 4.54 percent and 5.75 percent flat, respectively. South Carolina is an interesting case with a maximum income tax of 7 percent, but an effective property tax rate of 0.57 percent, the seventh lowest in the country. According to Wallethub, all of these states have total tax burdens lower than the U.S. average."
23,/texas/across-tx/former-white-house-physician-ronny-jackson-wins-gop-runoff-panhandle-congressional,2020-07-15T03:00:25Z,Former White House Physician Ronny Jackson Wins...,0,0,Texas Tribune,News Partner,"By Abby Livingston, The Texas Tribune July 14, 2020
Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician and President Donald Trump's onetime nominee for secretary of veterans affairs, has won his bid for the Republican nomination for a solidly red congressional seat in the Texas Panhandle.
With 100% of polling locations reporting, though some mail-in ballots will still need to be counted, Jackson held a lead of 11 percentage points over Josh Winegarner, a veteran agriculture expert and lobbyist. Jackson and Winegarner were competing for a seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, who is retiring and held the seat since 1995.
The district covers most of the Panhandle and reaches as far east as the Fort Worth suburbs.
""Former White House physician Ronny Jackson wins GOP runoff for Panhandle congressional race"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
Jackson also enjoyed the support of President Donald Trump, who campaign for Jackson as late as Monday in a telephone town hall, and the conservative group Club for Growth. Winegarner, meanwhile, ran on his local roots and his deep ties to the agriculture industry.
Trump nominated Jackson last year to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but he withdrew from consideration amid allegations of professional misconduct, including drinking on the job and overprescribing medication. He called the accusations ""completely false and fabricated.""
Jackson declared victory in a tweet Tuesday night: ""I promise I WILL MAKE YOU PROUD IN CONGRESS""
Jackson is one of two prominent Republicans seeking a return by securing runoff victories in solid red congressional seats in Texas. To the southeast, former U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions led medical office manager Renee Swann in the GOP primary for most of the evening in the heavily Republican Texas 17th District. More votes needed to be counted in that race, however. With just under half of polling locations reporting, Sessions held an eight percentage point lead.
Sessions previously represented the Dallas-based 32nd Congressional District since 1996, but lost reelection in 2018 to current U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat. He moved 100 miles south to Waco prior to entering the District 17 race.
Swann and Sessions are vying to replace U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, R-Bryan, who is retiring. Flores vigorously supported Swann over his former colleague, Sessions, to succeed him in the seat he held since 2011.

By Karen Brooks Harper/The Texas Tribune
There are two predominant theories of what Election Day will bring in Bexar County, as a record number of voters are expected to arrive at polling places in San Antonio and surrounding communities.
One holds that Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen, a seasoned pro considered by some to be the dean of Texas' local election officials, has crafted a measured plan for safe and orderly voting in the state's fourth most populous county.
The other predicts that the county is headed for a train wreck because Callanen, experienced and ethical though she may be, is an entrenched bureaucrat whose resistance to change will disenfranchise thousands of voters, mostly people of color.
Time will tell.
Refusing to be influenced by more aggressive, and politically charged, efforts to expand voting access undertaken in urban counties like Harris and Travis, Callanen has batted away several attempts by county officials to push her office into adopting new approaches to make things easier for the county's 1,181,842 registered voters.
Her counterparts in other large counties have added drive-thru and 24-hour voting, expanded curbside voting and tried to make mail-in drop offs more accessible, among other things.
But Callanen has resisted such moves. She's added 18 more polling sites only on order from a federal judge, and some question how she plans to spend the millions of dollars the county commissioner's court has pushed her way.
Some county leaders fear that a heated and highly motivating presidential election being conducted in a pandemic -- with more voting by mail and big crowds and long lines feared due to COVID-19 -- could put a strain on the system.
""You can't run an election in 2020 under a global pandemic, with a public health crisis amongst us, the way you did an election in 2002 or 2004,"" said Bexar County Commissioner Justin Rodriguez, who pushed for a litany of changes, largely rejected, that he said would make voting easier. ""It's just a different deal altogether.""
Callanen, with more than two decades experience running elections in the largely Hispanic county, said she has been guided by the desire to keep ""my elections workers and my voters"" safe from COVID, avoid the confusion and litigation that counties like Harris are seeing and maintain voter confidence in a process that is steady and familiar.
""Here in Bexar County, because we've had things so stable for so long, it puts people's minds at ease,"" she said. ""It goes back to the voters, it really does. And just from the sheer numbers that we've seen, they believe in the system.""
With a record-breaking 700,000 people expected to vote in this election, up to 175,000 on Election Day alone, the largely Democratic county of 2 million - 61% Hispanic - is a major force in presidential and statewide elections, and a potential player in the effort to flip the Texas House blue.
The July primary runoff drew double the number of voters that were expected, Callanen said. But staffing shortages, many caused by workers worried about COVID-19 exposure withdrawing at the last minute, shut down some polling places, causing long lines and late returns.
Some voting advocates and commissioners saw the runoff as a red flag and strengthened their push for new measures to make voting easier. They point to places like Harris and Travis counties, which are instituting unprecedented change in hopes of harnessing the wave of voter enthusiasm sweeping across Texas.
""The early warning sign to us was when Bexar County elections had to close 12 polling locations days before the July primary runoff,"" said H. Drew Galloway, executive director of MOVE Texas Civic Fund, which was part of a lawsuit aimed at the county over the number of Election Day locations earlier this summer. ""And that was due to a lack of poll workers, and poll workers being afraid of contracting COVID, but when you look at other counties who over-hired and paid people to be ready in case they had to be, Bexar County was just not prepared for that.""
But Callanen and her supporters say the county is already succeeding in handling record early voting turnout, and providing a safe environment for voters and workers.
""I keep saying, what would happen if COVID would enter this office and we all had to go quarantine?"" she said. ""So when you look at your long-range (plan), you have to take a stand, and you have to say, 'This is the way we're going to do it to keep everyone safe, period.' ""
It is also, she said, important to prevent the disenfranchisement borne of confusion and ""whiplash"" attendant to a torrent of change in the months before an already stressful and unprecedented election.
""Anything that confuses the voters, I'm not behind,"" Callanen said. ""I have a difficult time with anything that's put in once an election has kind of started. (When) someone wants to come along and change it, I find that hard.""
Callanen's supporters point to the number of voters who had, by Monday morning, already cast ballots voted in person -- nearly 450,000, surpassing the early in-person vote in 2016 and with five days of early voting still left left -- as evidence that voter access is strong.
""We're going to be okay,"" said Bexar County Judge Nelson W. Wolff, a Democrat who was on the elections commission that appointed Callanen in 2005. ""Just look at the numbers that are voting. That tells you that we're doing it right. … There's been some new things put in place to drive the vote as high as we can get it. So we'll have our record vote here this year.""
This isn't Houston
In Harris County, home to the Democratic stronghold of Houston, an interim county clerk has drawn national media exposure and a hailstorm of resistance and lawsuits from state and local Republicans over his myriad attempts to expand voter access in ways not seen before in Texas, including measures like drive-thru polling places and 24-hour voting sites.
On the other end of the spectrum, Callanen, a 23-year veteran of local elections who is accountable to a bipartisan election commission composed of countywide elected officials and party chairs, has embraced a more modest agenda to increase voter access this cycle: expanded early voting hours, six additional early-voting sites, online mail-in ballot tracking, the creation of ""mega-centers"" for voting, mailing absentee ballot applications to every registered senior citizen in the county, and, last year, the move to countywide polling places.
But she has rejected several more ideas supported by the Democrat-led commissioners court and local voter advocates: A 50% increase in early voting sites, live wait times posted on the county's website, 24-hour voting sites, expanded curbside voting, drive-through voting and multiple mail-in ballot drop offs. She also declined to join the unsuccessful legal pushes for universal mail-in balloting and a last-minute return to straight ticket voting, which was abolished by the Texas Legislature.
Many of the ideas, like straight ticket and universal mail in, simply came too close to the election, she said. Others, like live online wait times for voting locations, just sounded like bad ideas and could backfire, she said. She argued that multiple drop-off points were illegal, and that curbside and drive-through risks COVID exposure, the latter a position she said came from local health officials. Implementing 24-hour voting sites creates security issues and staffing problems, and more locations were unnecessary, she said.
Callanen and some other Bexar County officials, like Wolff, say the county is ready.
Four new voting ""mega centers"" have opened, the largest being the AT&T Center, where 40 voting machines are being used, Wolff said. The county will have 302 voting sites on Election Day.
The county has 2,500 high-tech voting machines that produce paper and electronic ballots, which Wolff said makes voting quick, reliable and easy. It has doubled its budget for a presidential year election, Wolff said, and added millions more in funding for staffing, COVID improvements, election technology and other needs through grants and federal funding, essentially giving the elections department a blank check for election expenses.
Rodriguez and some others question if Callanen plans to use all the money she's been offered, as records show expenditures of only about $1.3 million of some $11 million available, according to budget officials. But that does not yet reflect payroll costs for the election, budget officials said, and Callanen says staffing, COVID measures, new tabulation machines and similar costs will most certainly use up the budget.
At one point, Callanen, who said she tripled her full-time staff with temp employees for the election, told commissioners that she had ""maxed out"" on full time staff for early voting because there was no more capacity to train them safely amid COVID constraints.
'A Lot To Be Thankful For'
Callanen is widely known and respected among Texas elections administrators. Bexar is one of 118 counties where elections are run by nonpartisan, appointed administrators like her instead of elected county clerks.
A former teacher, she takes her role as independent administrator seriously, declining to get involved in a political party and offering a vehement ""Oh, God, no"" when asked if she had plans to run for office.
Although Bexar County elected officials have little direct control over Callanen's election decisions, leaders like Wolff defend the county's elections record.
""She's run I don't know how many elections and ran every one of them successfully,"" Wolff said. ""You know, Jacque has been there a good while, she's been set in her ways, so there's been differences between her and the court sometimes, and we've tried to work them out. But look at success. And tell me where she has failed in the past. Tell me how we're going to vote this many more, and she's not doing that right.""
Local political stalwarts, even some of her current critics, agree that in spite of late returns and occasional long lines, Bexar County elections generally haven't seen problems in the past.
But an increase in the number of registered voters -- nearly 140,000 new ones since 2016 -- combined with new statewide measures to limit voting options, such as the elimination of mobile voting sites, have put the county on the front line in protecting voters from disenfranchisement.
The advent of the pandemic and the increase in turnout has highlighted the need for voters to feel safe and counted at the polls, pitting local politicians and activists against each other over how best to do that.
The line of demarcation seems to be drawn not along party lines, but between those used to doing things the old way and those frustrated at their inability to push through new ideas, said state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, a San Antonio Democrat first elected to the Texas House in 2000.
""Fundamentally, election administration has been done very well in this county, and we've got a lot to be thankful for in regards to this elections office"" run by Callanen, he said.
Last week, a federal district court ordered the county to create 18 additional polling sites for Election Day after finding that the county election department had potentially disenfranchised people of color by closing several when it went to a countywide system and combined sites. Before the ruling, the county had the same number of polling sites that it had in 2019 and fewer than it had for several cycles before it had gone to county wide polling.
The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the Texas Civil Rights Project on behalf of MOVE Texas, the Texas Organizing Project, and a voter. The suit accused the county of years of providing too few polling places, something the judge also agreed with in her opinion.
Callanen defended the number of polling sites at the time, but she and the county declined to appeal the ruling and will have the additional locations in place for Election Day.
The biggest impediment for Bexar County voters, Wolff said, is what he called systemic voter repression from the state through decisions like not allowing universal mail balloting, not allowing COVID-19 to be grounds for requesting mail-in ballots, and the lack of online voter registration, among other things.
But even that, he said, doesn't seem to be holding Bexar County voters down this cycle.
""We have more restrictions than any state in the nation,"" Wolff said. ""Even though all those are in place, people are just saying, 'Goddammit, I'm going to get out there and vote.' And they are. Those (repression) techniques have worked in the past, but they're not working today.""
The disagreement is not just about this election, but how the county's voting apparatus will be run moving forward, as rolls and turnout increase, and as pandemic protocols and technological advancements change the way people vote, said Martinez Fischer.
""The election of 2020 is about two things,"" he said. ""It's about the heroic efforts of the voters, despite the obstacles and barriers and roadblocks, and how they have persevered and are voting in record numbers. This is a tale of that, and it's also a tale of looking into the future of elections and everything you can do to expand the franchise.""
Richard Gonzalez, chair of the Bexar County SD 19 Tejano Democrats, said the county's success or failure this November will determine whether his group pushes for replacing Callanen after the election. But voter access will also almost definitely be on the statewide Democratic platform when the party convenes again in 2022, much of that push inspired by the actions, or lack thereof, in his home county, said Gonzalez, a State Democratic executive committeeman who is chairman of the platform committee for the next two years.
""I know we'll be bringing this up as we go forward with the next two years to bring up our platform,"" he said. ""Voting accessibility is a major issue that we need to be focused on.""
Martinez Fischer gets why Callanen's decisions are cautious, he said, but he also understands the desire of many to push new ideas.
""You're seeing sort of a shift in county politics -- younger members coming in, new ideas, bold visions, and I think there was an honest attempt to expand the (voting) franchise and provide multiple opportunities,"" Martinez Fischer said.

By Aliyya Swaby, The Texas Tribune Oct. 23, 2020
As fall progresses, Texas public school superintendents are realizing that virtual instruction simply is not working for thousands of students across the state.
Report cards from the first weeks of the school year show more students than last year failing at least one class. Students are turning in assignments late, if at all; skipping days to weeks of virtual school; and falling behind on reading, educators and parents report. Many parents say they're exhausted from playing the role of at-home teacher, and some students without support at home are struggling to keep track of their daily workload with limited outside help.
The problems are concentrated among students trying to learn from home, more than 3 million of the state's 5.5 million public school students, according to administrators' accounts. The trends are adding urgency to calls for getting more students back into classrooms as quickly as possible.
""Alarming failure rates among Texas students fuel calls to get them back into classrooms"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
By now, many school districts hoped their students would be making up academic ground lost last spring, when the pandemic caused them to shut down classrooms. Texas is mandating that districts get back to normal this fall and prepare students for upcoming state standardized tests. Schools dialed up the intensity of their classes — and then an alarming number of students began failing.
As the first grading period came to a close, some administrators began temporarily backpedaling from their initial insistence on academic rigor. They gave teachers the message: Do what you can to make sure kids pass.
Judson Independent School District, in San Antonio, added a note to its grading handbook allowing principals to ""grant any exceptions"" and ""extend grace"" to students, letting them make up late work or drop assignments. ""We understand that connectivity issues, lack of devices, technological issues with the Student Portal, Canvas, and electronic books may impede a student from submitting their assignments in a timely manner,"" the handbook now reads.
Cathryn Mitchell, principal of Austin ISD's Gorzycki Middle School, sent an email in early October, obtained by The Texas Tribune, alerting all staff to a ""campus-wide dilemma."" Almost 25% of students were failing at least one class, including 200 failing more than one subject. She attributed the failures to steep technology learning curves, lack of access to devices and Wi-Fi, shifting reopening guidelines and anxiety over the health risks of on-campus learning.
The email implored teachers to exhaust ""all measures to assist the student before failing them,"" including working with them one on one, emailing or calling parents, and setting up Zoom parent conferences. For teachers unable to do everything to help a failing student before the grading deadline, Mitchell wrote, ""we would ask that you gift the student with a 70."" Texas' ""no pass, no play"" rule prohibits students pulling less than a 70 in one or more classes in a marking period from playing sports or participating in extracurricular activities for three weeks.
""We know that some students are taking advantage of the situation or have procrastinated to get themselves into this position. There is no question about that,"" Mitchell wrote. ""But we also know that we have asked a great deal of them these first five weeks. ... This will not be the norm every six-weeks.""
Austin ISD officials told the Tribune that school leaders are ""committed to high standards of academic rigor"" and working to ""better serve"" students with low averages or incomplete grades based on their individual needs. They did not respond to questions about whether Mitchell's approach was supported by the district or whether 25% is an average failure number across the district this marking period. According to KVUE-TV, about 11,700 Austin ISD students are failing at least one class this year, a 70% increase from last year.
As the extent of students' struggles become clear, parents and superintendents are increasingly determined to get students back to school, the pendulum of their worries swinging away from health risks and toward the risks of students not learning at all. ""Districts are starting to feel some real internal pressure as educators,"" said Joy Baskin, legal services director at the Texas Association of School Boards. ""If they feel that there's enough momentum around getting everyone back, I think that's their preference.""
State data on COVID-19 in schools is limited and full of gaps, but it points toward low student infection rates, encouraging some experts. Experts say layering policies such as sanitization, social distancing and masks is needed to reduce the risk of transmission. Despite outcries from some teachers and parents, dozens of school districts have nixed their virtual learning options altogether and brought nearly all students back to classrooms.
According to the San Antonio Express-News, at least one of those districts is attempting to require all remote learners with failing grades to return in person — violating recently updated state guidance. ""Discontinuing remote instruction in a way that only targets struggling students is not permitted,"" the updated guidance reads.
Texas school districts don't have much time to get students back on track. This academic year, the Texas Education Agency will resume strict sanctions on schools and districts with consistently low student standardized test scores after pausing those penalties last spring. And there are dollars at stake, with state funding tied to student attendance. Districts have reported losing track of thousands of students, including some of their most vulnerable, who haven't logged into virtual classes or responded to phone calls and door knocks. According to state leaders, schools that are open for in-person instruction have seen higher levels of enrollment than those with only virtual education.
San Antonio's Northside ISD has not changed its expectations for virtual students, despite seeing higher failure rates, said Superintendent Brian Woods. Since many students learning from home are low income, Black and Hispanic, lowering academic standards for those students could end up deepening existing inequities, he said.
Instead, the district has put together a call team to reach out to low-performing virtual learners and urge them to come back to campus. Just under 45% of students are learning from classrooms in the second grading period, up from less than 25% earlier in the fall, when the district slowly phased students in. ""We're not going to fix it by only taking the good grades or dropping half the grades,"" Woods said. ""We've got to dig in and look more at the root cause. We know what it is: There's kids who need to be in the building, period.""
In Brazosport ISD, where 78% of students are learning in classrooms, a quarter of virtual learners are failing two or more classes, compared with 8% of at-school students. The district is ""not dropping our expectations for at-home students,"" said Superintendent Danny Massey. But with coronavirus cases dropping in Brazoria County and district officials being transparent about COVID-19 cases on campuses, more parents are gradually choosing to send their students back.
Some Austin ISD parents are considering sending their children back later this fall, once the district returns to in-person instruction that more closely resembles a regular classroom. When the district reopened, it had students sitting in classrooms but learning virtually. The state halted that approach. Rosemary Wynn, an Austin ISD parent, thinks her eighth and ninth grade sons may get more out of learning in person once it includes more face-to-face instruction.
She and her husband had a stern talk with their O. Henry Middle School eighth grader earlier this fall after realizing he had not opened about 100 emails from his teachers, except one from his football coach. He was previously a straight-A student, but at one point his grade in one class had fallen to 29, she said.
""Children don't know how to read email. That is not part of their repertoire,"" she said, with exasperation. ""I haven't had a single teacher reach out to say, 'your kids' grades this, your kids' grades that.' I think the whole way this is set up is a recipe for disaster.""
Kelly Sanders and her son Bizuayehu Crouther, a 14-year-old at Austin High School in Austin ISD, regularly debate whether he should return later this fall. Bizuayehu has dyslexia and dysgraphia, which impacts his ability to write clearly by hand, and he's found virtual learning much easier. ""I do not want to go back,"" he said.
Sanders is concerned that the second grading period will be even more academically rigorous and that her son will not be able to keep up virtually. ""I'm happy that [he is] making really good grades right now, but I'm concerned that it still isn't as rigorous as the classes would be if it were in person. If at some point he has to take a standardized test on the material, I don't know what that looks like,"" she said.
But for other parents, the decision is easy. Single parent Renee Schalk chose to keep her 17-year-old son and 2-year-old triplets home from Georgetown schools and doesn't regret it. ""My children are children of color,"" said Schalk, who is Black. ""I don't want them subjected to COVID-19. … We're not doing enough in this state, we're not doing anything in this country to make it safe.""
Angelina Allegrini, a 14-year-old ninth grader in San Antonio's North East ISD, said her grades suffered in the beginning of the year as she got accustomed to the variety of programs teachers used for online learning and the exhaustion of staring at a screen for three to four hours a day. After a few weeks, and a little leniency from teachers, she pulled them back up.
But the social, extroverted teenager still felt she was missing something. ""I wanted to try to get to know people in my class. I saw some of them on the screen, but that's not the same,"" she said.
On Monday, after several weeks of learning from home, Angelina walked into her high school for the first time this year. Her mother, Cherise Rohr Allegrini, a prominent epidemiologist in San Antonio, said she was ""not thrilled"" about her daughter's decision but predicted it wouldn't last long, with a surge in COVID-19 cases likely on the horizon. ""I think they're probably going to change and close schools in a couple of weeks or so,"" she said. ""We're going to start seeing outbreaks on campuses.""

By Stacy Fernández, The Texas Tribune Oct. 21, 2020
The most Jessica Elbel's kids have ventured out of the house since the pandemic began is to play in the yard or sit in the back seat of the car while their mom or dad picked up a curbside grocery order.
It hasn't been easy, but Elbel and her husband, Donald, have gone to great lengths to shield their family from COVID-19 exposure. Donald Elbel went so far as to leave his job to help their 7- and 9-year-old kids with virtual schooling.
So when she got the message from the school district earlier this month saying that in-person classes would be mandatory, Jessica Elbel began to panic.
""Some Texas school districts are requiring in-person instruction again, leaving parents scrambling for options"" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.
""The District will transition back to 100% in-person learning. The last day of remote learning will be Friday, October 16th,"" said the update from Clay Rosenbaum, superintendent of the Blanco Independent School District Superintendent. The message was sent to the families of the roughly 1,000 students enrolled in the small school district in Texas Hill Country. It was posted a week before students were to return.
As the numbers of people infected and hospitalized by the virus tick back up across the state, dozens of Texas school districts eliminated the option for remote learning and forced students, faculty and staff to return to the classroom, with few exceptions. The number is rapidly growing.
For most families afraid of returning, school districts provided three options: home school, switch districts or enroll in an online school. But families say these options aren't easily accessible on such short notice and can be cost prohibitive.
""I don't appreciate being put in a position where I feel like I don't have a choice,"" Jessica Elbel said.
School experts say gradually more Texas students will be brought back into the classroom. So far the school districts to make the change are smaller and some serve more rural populations.
""It's becoming more and more common. Geographically it's focused in places where they're able to do it and feel like they're operating safely,"" said Joy Surratt Baskin, legal services director of the Texas Association of School Boards.
State data on transmission in public schools shows that just over 9,700 students reported positive COVID-19 cases, but the data is limited and full of gaps.
District superintendents pointed to inconsistent attendance, subpar student engagement and lower grades for students taking virtual classes compared with their in-person counterparts.
At Lubbock-Cooper ISD, only 40% of online learners in elementary school and 10% of online learners in high school regularly attended classes and turned in assignments, Superintendent Keith Bryant said. About 55% of remote students at Blanco ISD and 70% of online students at Roosevelt ISD — 8 miles east of Lubbock — were failing, according to the superintendents.
Gary Martel, Moody ISD superintendent, said school officials made calls or did home visits to households with students who were falling behind or not logging on to class. The roughly 690-student district in Central Texas mandated that students return to in-person school by Oct. 13 — but it only applied to remote learners with poor attendance, those with a lack of instructional engagement or those who were in danger of failing a course.
Superintendents said the labor and educational sacrifices aren't worth it for a program that only served about 10% to 20% of the total student population.
""If our remote learners would have stepped up and held up their end of the bargain, I think we would have made it work, but it's not worth it to risk our staff and burn them out. Any school district that is OK with 70% of their students failing and doesn't do something drastic, shame on them for doing that,"" said Superintendent Dallas Grimes of Roosevelt ISD, which serves about 1,060 students and ended remote learning in late September.
Brent Hawkins, superintendent of Livingston ISD in East Texas, said in an email that the online learning option was ""never intended"" to be a long-term program. The 4,000-student district required kids return in person Oct. 13; parents were notified on the first of the month.
Superintendents also said teachers are overworked because they have to tailor instruction both for virtual students and in-person class.
But some teachers don't want to return to the classroom.
""We fear these safety violations and the elimination of the virtual learning option for students is endangering the health and safety, even potentially the lives, of many students, educators and their families,"" said Clay Robison, a spokesperson for the Texas State Teachers Association.
Some districts are also requiring that teachers return to campus, even in some cases in which most students chose remote learning. Teachers said school administrators unfairly expect them to put their lives in danger. Several districts are trying to accommodate teachers with health conditions who want to work from home, but they are largely expected to return to work in-person.
More than 2 million Texas public school students are already attending school in person, which is still less than half of the 5.5 million students total — but the number doubled from the start of the school year.
Every Texas school district is required to offer an in-person option if they want to get state funding unless they have a state-approved waiver due to high levels of community spread of the coronavirus. The vast majority — including Texas' most populous school districts — are operating hybrid models.
But families in districts that are cutting remote learning have been frustrated by the short notice and lack of options.
""The district has really abandoned the 10% of us that are remote learning,"" Jessica Elbel said. ""There is a sense that they view us as a small group of dissenters and they just kind of want us to go away.""
After considering expensive online schooling alternatives that she couldn't afford, she said she will home-school her kids.
There will be some exceptions for kids with medical conditions.
Jennifer Gradel's twins are medically fragile, so when Livingston ISD eliminated remote learning, she was granted special permission to keep them home. She asked for the same exemption from in-person school for her high school-aged son, fearing he could expose his siblings. That request was denied.
""Before you sent that email on the first [of the month] to all of these parents, you should have gotten your medically fragile students and their families taken care of,"" Gradel said.
District superintendents said nearly all of the remote families who withdrew from the district chose to home school. But parents say that's expensive, too.
That includes Kasey Evans, whose 7-year-old attended Livingston ISD. When the remote option went away this month, Evans opted for home school and had to return her son's school-provided Chromebook and Wi-Fi hotspot. Evans was let go from her job in September because of the coronavirus pandemic and had to get help from her mom to replace the borrowed technology.
Similarly, Rachelle Willgren of Blanco ISD spent $200 on workbooks and a home-school curriculum. Willgren thought remote learning would last at least until after the holidays.
""If I had known that the school district was gonna do this, I never would have enrolled them this year,"" Willgren said.

28,/texas/across-tx/how-ca-expats-are-helping-turn-texas-battleground-state,2020-10-08T20:39:20Z,How CA Expats Are Helping Turn Texas Into A...,0,0,CalMatters,News Partner,"By Matt Levin, CalMatters:
Pushed by the soaring cost of living, more than 700,000 Californians have moved to the Lone Star state since 2008. It's part of the reason historically bright red Texas has turned surprisingly purple in 2020.
When Dr. Myiesha Taylor saw her Biden-Harris lawn sign was missing from the front yard, she did what most parents would do — she blamed her kids.
Taylor and her husband William sat their three children down to scour through the footage from their home security system. It was like family movie night, with the added intrigue that someone in the audience might be guilty of a campaign violation.
""We're watching and we're watching, and then we see the car come up and turn on our street, and then stop,"" said Taylor. ""And we're like 'Wait, why are they stopping in front of our house?'""
It's nighttime and the security camera is pretty far away. But even through the Zapruder filter, you can parse pretty clearly what's happening. The silhouette of a John or Jane Doe gets out of the passenger seat, jumps on the Taylor property's retaining wall, snatches the Biden-Harris sign and smuggles it into the getaway car.
""I'm from California,"" said Taylor, who was born in Inglewood and went to medical school at the University of Southern California. ""Never would I have thought that Trump would have won. I'm thinking, 'Who voted for this guy?' Then I moved here and I realized who voted for this guy.""
""Here"" for Taylor is Tarrant County, Texas — home to the cities of Fort Worth, Arlington and an endless stretch of freshly subdivided bedroom communities. Over the past decade, those bedrooms have been increasingly filled by a steady stream of Californians like Taylor, lured by lucrative job offers and cheap home prices.
Taylor hasn't solved the case of the lawn sign heist just yet. But one possible motive? Fear that Texas — a state once synonymous with Republican strength — could actually tilt Democratic this year, as recent transplants from California and other blue states help reshape the Lone Star state's electorate.
""Where things look really different in Texas politics right now are in these districts that have seen rapid population growth, and Californians have been a part of that growth,"" said Jim Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin.
Recent polls show President Trump with only a narrow advantage — two to five percentage points — over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Texas. Some polls show the race as essentially tied, and very little polling has been done since Trump's COVID-19 hospitalization upended the campaign.
While the prospect of Texas as a swing state may shock those who associate the state with George W. Bush and open carry gun laws, it shouldn't surprise anyone paying attention to its politics over the last decade. While Barack Obama lost Texas by 16 points in his 2012 re-election bid, in 2016 Hillary Clinton closed that gap to single-digits. Two years later, Democrat Beto O'Rourke lost to incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz by less than three points.
The improving performance of Texas Democrats tracks well with the exodus of Californians into Sun Belt states over the past two decades. Since 2008, more than 700,000 Californians have moved to Texas, at first propelled by the Great Recession and later by their home state's increasingly untenable cost of living.
Henson warns it's seductively reductionist to attribute Texas' rapid statewide purpling simply to California expats. When you factor in the number of Texans that have moved to California over the last decade, the net political effect on a state with 29 million people is less progressive tidal wave and more trickling blue-ish tributary. With a rising Latino population and growing metropolitan areas, Texas' internal demographic shifts have combined with out-of-state immigration (not just from California) to alter its politics.
It's also a mistake to think everyone from California moving to Texas drove there in a Prius adorned with a ""Billionaires can't buy Bernie"" bumper sticker. While precise polling on ex-Californians' political persuasions is hard to find, loads of anecdotal evidence suggest a decent chunk of Golden State emigres are fleeing the state precisely because of its progressive culture.
But the parts of Texas where Californians are most likely to move — the sprawling suburbs of Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth — are now politically competitive in a way that was unfathomable 20 years ago. Even if progressive Californians aren't numerous enough to push Texas away from Trump, they can still tilt congressional and state legislative races. In many places, they already have.
""Those areas, particularly the suburban and exurban areas outside of Texas metros, have become ground zero for a much more competitive Texas in which the Republican hegemony that has been so uniform here for the last twenty years has come under siege,"" said Henson.
You won't find a bigger fan of Californians than Deborah Peoples, chair of the Tarrant County Democratic Party. She says she's gotten so used to running into Californians in her native state, she can spot one just by looking at them.
""There's something about the way they walk or something,"" said Peoples. ""I usually say 'Are you from California?' and 99% of the time I'm right.""
Historically, Republicans have dominated the vast majority of 902 square mile county, situated about 30 miles west of Dallas. In the past, Tarrant County's bluish-tinged cities of Fort Worth and Arlington were flanked by an overwhelmingly conservative block of rural voters. Lyndon Johnson was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win it.
But an influx of new arrivals, including thousands from out of state, has made Tarrant County the fifth fastest growing county in the country, swelling its population to over 2 million last year according to Census estimates. That has meant more volunteers for Peoples — especially recent transplants from Southern California and the Bay Area. At $230,000 a pop, you can buy nearly three Tarrant County homes for the price of your average home in L.A. County.
""I think we're seeing this level of activism among Californians,"" said Peoples. ""When they get here they look at the political landscape, they say this doesn't look like where I came from, and what do I do to change it.""
The cracks in the Texas GOP's grip on Tarrant County began to show after 2016. O'Rourke carried the county by a little more than 3,000 votes — a shocker to local Republicans. Democrats also flipped a state Senate seat held by a long-term incumbent Republican.
Those gains have not gone unnoticed by national Democratic strategists. The Democratic National Committee is targeting an open congressional seat in Tarrant County, with money pouring in for the first time in decades.
While Peoples may be elated with her new Californian neighbors, the Texas GOP is not rolling out the welcome mat. Like President Trump, Republicans statewide are using California's problems to mobilize their own voters. Homelessness and California's exorbitant cost of living are rhetorical go-to's.
""Don't California my Texas"" was a popular campaign slogan for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in his successful 2018 re-election. You can buy t-shirts and mugs with the slogan.
""California came to symbolize the kind of political change that Republicans were sure their voters did not want, in the sense that it symbolized a more liberal worldview,"" said Henson.
In her neighborhood in Keller, an affluent suburb in Tarrant County, Dr. Myiesha Taylor says she doesn't hear anti-California rhetoric all that much. That's partly because she says most of her neighbors are from out-of-state anyway. She's more likely to meet someone from New York or New Jersey or Illinois than someone born and raised in Tarrant County.
Taylor's quick to note that she loves some parts of living in Texas. Cheap real estate meant she could buy a big home with enough space for her growing family. The first Texas home they bought in 2009 was 2,500 square feet — and only $250,000.
Taylor also feels more respected as a physician in Texas than she did in California. Texans seem more inclined to respect authority and titles, and the ""kumbaya"" ethos of some of the California hospitals she worked in frequently made her job more difficult.
But as a Black woman in a mixed race household, Taylor does say she misses the sense of security she felt when living in California. While she and her family laugh at the lawn sign incident, Taylor says it triggered a part of her that's never been quite so comfortable in her adopted home.
""You start to think 'how far will people go, how crazy are people really?' said Taylor. ""And then on those occasions, I think maybe if I were in California, I wouldn't have to worry so much about our safety.""

29,/texas/across-tx/foreign-hackers-cripple-texas-county-s-email-system,2020-09-24T21:52:48Z,Foreign Hackers Cripple Texas County’s Email...,0,0,Pro Publica,News Partner,"From ProPublica:
By Jack Gillum, Jessica Huseman, Jeff Kao and Derek Willis
Last week, voters and election administrators who emailed Leanne Jackson, the clerk of rural Hamilton County in central Texas, received bureaucratic-looking replies. ""Re: official precinct results,"" one subject line read. The text supplied passwords for an attached file.
But Jackson didn't send the messages. Instead, they came from Sri Lankan and Congolese email addresses, and they cleverly hid malicious software inside a Microsoft Word attachment. By the time Jackson learned about the forgery, it was too late. Hackers continued to fire off look-alike replies. Jackson's three-person office, already grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, ground to a near standstill.
""I've only sent three emails today, and they were emails I absolutely had to send,"" Jackson said Friday. ""I'm scared to"" send more, she said, for fear of spreading the malware.
The previously unreported attack on Hamilton illustrates an overlooked security weakness that could hamper the November election: the vulnerability of email systems in county offices that handle the voting process from registration to casting and counting ballots. Although experts have repeatedly warned state and local officials to follow best practices for computer security, numerous smaller locales like Hamilton appear to have taken few precautionary measures.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have helped local governments in recent years to bolster their infrastructure, following Russian hacking attempts during the last presidential election. But desktop computers used each day in small rural counties to send routine emails, compose official documents or analyze spreadsheets can be easier targets, in part because those jurisdictions may not have the resources or know-how to update systems or afford security professionals familiar with the latest practices.
A ProPublica review of municipal government email systems in swing states found that dozens of them relied on homebrew setups or didn't follow industry standards. Those protocols include encryption to ensure email passwords are secure and measures that confirm that people sending emails are who they purport to be. At least a dozen counties in battleground states didn't use cloud-hosted email from firms like Google or Microsoft. While not a cure-all, such services improve protections against email hacks.
Although the malware used against Hamilton likely originated with foreign hackers, it appears to have been part of a widespread campaign, rather than one that targeted election-related sites. The malware also doesn't appear to have spread from Hamilton to other Texas counties. And because Hamilton is a so-called offline county, the attack didn't affect state voter systems. State and Hamilton County officials said the intrusion won't affect voters' ability to cast ballots or have them tabulated.
Still, such attacks could rattle voters' confidence — or, at worst, bring down systems on election day. The type of malware deployed against Hamilton, called Emotet, often serves as a delivery mechanism for later ransomware attacks, in which swindlers commandeer a victim's computer and freeze its files until a ransom is paid. U.S. officials have expressed concern that those attacks — which have paralyzed government agencies, police departments, schools and hospitals — could potentially disrupt the election.
Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, which specializes in establishing best practices for political campaigns and election officials, said in a February 2018 report that election officials should ""create a proactive security culture."" For political campaigns, the group suggested using cloud-based email and office software, which are more likely to neutralize threats like Emotet before they reach a user's inbox. Experts said smaller governments with fewer resources should heed that advice.
Hamilton County has 8,500 residents and voted for President Donald Trump by a 6-to-1 margin in 2016. Almost all of the county offices, including Jackson's, are located in the courthouse. During the pandemic, residents submit paperwork through a cracked window at the top of the courthouse steps, next to the door. A handwritten note taped to the glass reads, ""If we don't see you, please yell!""
Jackson's office uses multiple email accounts, runs Microsoft Windows and edits Word files locally on its computers, as opposed to a cloud service like Google Docs, which is more likely to strip out malicious code. None of the emails sent to Hamilton was flagged as suspicious, according to a ProPublica review. The county's email system lacks two-factor authentication — a standard protection involving a second means of verifying a user's identity. It also hasn't implemented DMARC, a system that helps organizations and businesses confirm that emails sent from their addresses are authentic.
Last November, AT&T Corp. performed a security audit for the county clerk's office, a service offered free to counties by the Texas secretary of state. Jackson said last year's audit, which took place before her appointment, highlighted no major concerns, but another one is being conducted this year. A representative of the secretary of state's office said that the audit is a ""top-to-bottom assessment"" of both physical and cyber security, including the email system, and said Hamilton ""may or may not have"" implemented the recommendations.
ProPublica obtained five malware samples from Hamilton County and identified them as Emotet. The security firm Proofpoint, which examined the samples at our request, traced them to two weeklong Emotet campaigns in mid-September likely involving millions of malicious email attachments.
Emotet tricks users into clicking on plausible-looking messages and following phony instructions that in reality disable security settings in Microsoft Office. If successful, the ruse allows the malware to hijack the victim's email conversations and send phony replies from bogus accounts. Malware attached to the messages is primed for a new set of targets automatically selected from the victim's inbox, further spreading the infection.
Jackson, who has been county clerk less than a year, said she didn't know who in the office clicked on the fake messages. She also said she has received little help from the county's outside IT firm, BizProtec LLC. She said she noticed what appeared to be phishing emails on Monday, Sept. 14, and first alerted BizProtec the next day. By that afternoon, BizProtec called to assure her that it had fixed the problem by changing computer passwords for her and the rest of the office, which Hamilton County employees cannot do on their own. But the new passwords didn't help. By noon this past Monday, a week after the attack began, her inbox had more than 35 suspicious emails — including one that appeared to be from the county judge and contained malware.
Experts ProPublica interviewed said that changing passwords is unlikely to scrub malware. ""You facepalm when you hear that advice,"" said Ryan Kalember, executive vice president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint. ""Unless you clean up an infection, it'll just keep coming back. You can change your password a million times — it does not actually matter.""
Hamilton County wouldn't say how much BizProtec charges for its services, but a work proposal for nearby Bosque County shows the firm bills $95 an hour for typical service calls and $125 for calls outside of normal business hours. BizProtec also appears to do IT work for Cooke, Falls, Gonzales, Wheeler, Young, Llano, Eastland and Somervell counties, procurement records show, which combined have more than 150,000 residents.
Email and phone messages left with BizProtec and its owner, Kerry Hancock, seeking comment this week were not returned. Email addresses for Uvalde, Kleberg and Matagorda counties appeared on Emotet-generated emails sent to a listserv of Texas officials. However, those counties said they were not infected, and it's possible that their email addresses were taken from Hamilton County inboxes and used to spread the malware to recipients of Hamilton emails.
Hamilton residents and business owners have received malware from several county offices, according to Jackson. Yet the county's top elected official, County Judge W. Mark Tynes, told ProPublica he doesn't think there was a problem.
""We get spoofed all the time,"" Tynes said, insisting to a reporter that he had no reason to believe the malware incident was anything serious. ""BizProtec told me they were taking care of it,"" he said. ""I have no reason to be dissatisfied with BizProtec.""
Told that his own email address was being used to send infected messages, Tynes didn't seem alarmed. ""I'm retiring at the end of my term,"" he said.
Security experts said there's ample reason for concern. Last year, Emotet was one of the most common precursors for large-scale ransomware attacks, and the likely vector by which they wormed their way into municipal governments, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Intel 471.
""This is a massively spread, low-sophistication and low-targeting attack, and they were hacked by that. If a nation-state went after them,"" Mark Arena, CEO of Intel 471, said, ""they'd crumble in a second.""
A May DHS analysis obtained by ProPublica found that cybercriminals continue to use software tied to Emotet to attack public and private sector networks. Emotet hackers sometimes sell access to compromised computers to a third party, said Roman Huessy of abuse.ch, a website that tracks malware. ""This third party then may resell that access once again, and it sooner or later ends up with a ransomware gang,"" Huessy said.
Kalember, the Proofpoint executive, said that the Emotet cybercrime group likely originated in Russia, raising the prospect that computers compromised by the malware could end up in the hands of Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU. ""There's tons of history of Emotet-like groups being coerced into doing things that the GRU wants,"" Kalember said. ""If I were running an intelligence operation, I'd absolutely want to use [malware] like Emotet because there's plausible deniability on multiple different layers.""
Here's what you can do ahead of time to be prepared for the 2020 election.
This year, ProPublica revealed the frailty of parts of America's patchwork election infrastructure, including outdated websites that publish voting results. We found that at least 50 election-related websites in counties and towns voting on Super Tuesday were particularly vulnerable to cyberattack.
As of June 2019, Texas requires all elected officials and county employees who have access to local government computer systems to undergo cybersecurity training every year. The Texas Association of Counties, which represents county officials, offers a free course that it says meets the state's requirements. Jody Seaborn, a spokesman for the association, said that he had not heard about the Hamilton County malware episode and that the group ""strongly encourages"" counties to adopt cybersecurity best practices. A representative of the secretary of state's office said that Hamilton County employees recently renewed their security training, as is required annually by Sept. 1.
Jackson said she works 60 hours a week, often returning to the office after dinner. She said she doesn't have time to also be her department's IT staff and wouldn't know how to do it if she wanted to.
She remains in the throes of planning for November, having gotten little rest after just organizing a July runoff election. ""I am still trying to master elections,"" she said. ""How am I supposed to do that if I can't use my email?""

30,/texas/across-tx/texas-gets-d-its-state-finances-0,2020-09-22T09:00:00Z,"Texas Gets A ""D"" For Its State Finances",0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"A new report on the financial condition of the 50 states ranked Texas no. 34 in the nation for its fiscal health prior to the coronavirus pandemic. The report found that the majority of the states were ill-prepared for any crisis, much less one as serious as what we are currently facing.
The analysis by Truth in Accounting, a non-profit government finance watchdog group, found Texas needed $96.7 billion to get out of the red, or $11,300 from each of its taxpayers.
According to the watchdog's eleventh annual Financial State of the States report, Texas had $185.7 billion in bills and only $89 billion in available assets to pay those bills after capital and restricted assets are excluded. This resulted in a $96.7 billion shortfall, or an $11,300 Taxpayer Burden, which is each taxpayer's share of the state debt after the state's available assets have been tapped. TIA's Taxpayer Burden indicator incorporates both assets and liabilities, including unfunded retirement obligations.
Texas was not alone in being ill-prepared for a crisis. Total debt among the 50 states amounted to $1.4 trillion at the end of the fiscal year 2019, which will only worsen as the states face varying and unpredictable effects from the global pandemic.
The bottom line is that Texas did not have enough money to pay its bills, which is why it received a ""D"" grade for its fiscal health.
