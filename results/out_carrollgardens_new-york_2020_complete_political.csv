Good Evening,
Tomorrow's Brooklyn Community Board 6 General Board meeting will be postponed until further notice. This decision was made based on feedback from board members, indicating that we would not have achieved quorum. By law, there can be no action taken in the absence of a quorum. Given members' health concerns and the fact that there is nothing time-sensitive on the agenda , there is no reason to cajole our volunteers to attend.
Of course, we'll keep you posted, and share information as we receive it. Please note that we hope to be able to reschedule this meeting at some point this month.
Reporting on some good news, our district's biggest healthcare provider, NYP Brooklyn Methodist, has set up a hotline( (646-697-4000) for questions regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19), as well as a fact sheet and webpage dedicated to providing useful information .

Our January board meeting, held Wednesday night at PS 58, had a light agenda, but it's likely to be ""the calm before the storm"" before winds of 2020 starting blowing in. We were out of there in under an hour, as there was only 1 item on the agenda for approval.
Prior to dealing with the permits and licensing motion, our Board Secretary Karen Broughton, officially, certified the election of our current officers (Chair, 1st Vice-Chair, 2nd Vice-Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer) for another one-year term. It must be noted that Karen's attendance is particularly impressive as she made it back in time after being in Albany, where she attended the Governor's ""State of the State"" address.
The December 2019 minutes were approved. Chairperson Peter Fleming then gave his report, which included informing those in attendance about the revocation of the liquor license for Woodlands and the resale of the 5th Avenue Key food site. Peter made a point of mentioning that the new owners have indicated they will adhere to the agreement to retain a supermarket at the 120 5th Avenue address. We will continue to monitor the situation in conjunction with Councilmember Lander's office. This is especially important with so many supermarkets closing in recent years, and given how hard the community worked to make sure a supermarket would still serve our community. Peter also let folks know that applications for membership on Brooklyn community boards are open and will remain so until February 14th.
On the subject of board applications, my report got rolling by letting folks know that hard copies of the applications were available at the meeting, as well as online and that with few opening becoming a public member was a terrific alternative option. I then mentioned the Noel Pointer Foundation becoming the new tenants at the Degraw Street Firehouse and discussed our involvement with Warren Street tenants as an example of how CB6 can work to build better relationships between our neighbors and their city government. I mentioned subscribing to our email updates as it's helped create a dialogue and open lines of communication. If something is going on in our community that you'd like to get on the CB6 radar, please let me know. For example, this update is the reason I was planning on attending the Park Slope Civic Council meeting Thursday night at the Old Stone House.
Our Permits and Licenses Committee Chair Rachel Freeman presented their recommendation for approval of a sidewalk café at 72 5th Avenue that we overwhelmingly approved.
Representatives from the offices of Borough President Adams, Congresswoman Clarke, Councilmembers Lander and Levin, State Senators Montgomery and Myrie, Assemblymembers Carroll and Simon each spoke on behalf of their principals.
When we went into community session, there was mention of public safety concerns and drug use around Baltic Street and 4th Avenue/ Gregory Place about and we've already reached out to proper authorities.
During New Business, Joe Anne Brown reemphasized the work we've been doing at Warren Street and the concerns residents continue to express. Kathy Park Price reminded everyone of the Citizens Squirrel event CB6 is co-sponsoring this upcoming Tuesday, January 14th and 1st Vice-Chair Eric McClure announced that our Transportation /Public Safety committee, with a location & agenda still being ironed out, would be meeting on January 30th which is the 5th Thursday of the month and not the usual 3rd Thursday."

Briget Rein, a Carroll Gardens resident and former Brooklyn teacher, announced her campaign with Kings County Politics this week. She has become the second candidate officially running for the District 39 seat, which will be empty once Lander's term-limit is up in the 2021 election.
Rein told Kings County Politics that she has been hoping for a while to continue Lander's, and de Blasio's, legacy representing the Northwest Brooklyn district, which stretches over Park Slope and Gowanus from Kensington, all the way to the Columbia Waterfront.
""Two years ago, I decided that it would be a good opportunity for me to continue my work in City Hall and run for City Council,"" Rein said. ""I believe that my community is extremely important. I thank Bill de Blasio and Brad Lander for their service. Both of them did a superb job, and I want to continue doing that job.""
Rein was raised in Midwood and worked as a teacher at PS109 in Flatbush before joining the political world when she became the United Federation of Teachers chapter leader for her school. She would eventually go on to work for the union and has been a longtime activist for their cause.
""With that activism, I got involved in campaigns,"" Rein told Kings County Politics.
Rein works now as the union's city hall liaison and has worked as the deputy political director for the organization.
The issues she holds most closely include education and the new development that will hit the Gowanus area, which is currently slated for a massive rezoning plan.
She is joined in the race by New Kings Democrats President Brandon West. Others have been rumored to run, but haven't officially announced yet.
Patch plans to talk more with Rein next week."

Brooklynites participating in the 2018 midterm elections on Nov. 6 were plagued by busted ballot scanners at dozens of polling sites all over the borough, from Greenpoint to Bay Ridge and from Carroll Gardens to Flatbush, according to reports from Twitter.
""I had to document this,"" wrote Williamsburg voter Marshall S. Thompson. ""3 broken voting machines and 1 working machine is unacceptable. 400+ people waiting 2-3 hours to vote""
The New York City Board of Elections did not immediately respond to Patch's request for more information about the numerous broken scanners, and voters noted difficulty in connecting with the agency on election day.
""No one answering the scanner extension on the Brooklyn office line,"" Will Femia alerted the BOE on Twitter.
""Are you guys doing anything about broken machines?"" Asked @AVeryNastyWoman. ""There are many tweets re scanners not working in Brooklyn.""
But, despite delays, New Yorkers also noted the large number of people willing to stick out the rain and long lines to cast their votes.
And several voters told Patch they'd never seen so many people turn out at their polling sites before.
""This is the biggest turnout I've ever seen,"" said Andie Springer, 34, who voted in Ditmas Park Tuesday morning.
Springer said she believed the turnout was a response to the low numbers of voters reported in the 2016 presidential election.
""It's been made clear how apathetic everyone is,"" Springer said. ""We have to right this s---.""

Craig Hammerman returned to work this week at Community Board 6 — a panel that advises the city and state on local issues in Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus and Park Slope — after a lengthy leave of absence following his arrests.
His attorney, Joyce David, told Patch on Friday that his case has been adjourned until Nov. 1, and unless the D.A.'s office notifies the court that it is ready to proceed, the case will be dropped. David said the D.A.'s office has told her they expect the case to be dismissed.
""I expect that it will,"" she told Patch. ""But I've been around too long to have anything be guaranteed.""
A spokesperson at the D.A.'s office declined to comment on the case when reached by Patch.
Hammerman has been with the board since 1990 and makes more than $110,000 a year in his post as its only paid member.
In early April, he was arrested after police said he used his ex-girlfriend's Uber account to follow her to a hotel in Bed-Stuy. Then, prosecutors said, he was arrested for breaking a restraining order when he sat next to her at a Park Slope bar. Hammerman turned down a plea deal over the summer in the case.
If the charges against Hammerman are dropped, that doesn't necessarily mean his position as a public servant in the community is safe.
Community Board 6's closed-door finance, personnel and law committee arise reviewing his status with the board. And the city's Law Department is investigating his conduct.
The board's chair, Sayar Lonial, has declined to comment on the review, including to other board members. That has angered some in the community, who think the board should be more forthcoming in its deliberations.
""This remains an internal personnel matter and public comment at present would be inappropriate,"" Lonial told Patch in an email.

Lander, who represents Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace and Kensington, didn't face a challenger in Tuesday's Democratic primary and, as a result, wasn't even on the ballot. He'll likely cruise to a third term in November's general election in the hyper-liberal district.
So how did Lander spend the last part of his election night, without having to watch election returns with bated breath? He hung out with Arcade Fire's Will Butler, at an activism-themed after party of the band's show at Madison Square Garden.
Butler hosted a ""Disco Town Hall"" at Nublu in Alphabet City. The event was meant to ""engage Arcade Fire fans (and others!) with local organizations, activists, and politicians engaged in helping the vulnerable and empowering communities. There will also be music and dancing. Because that's important too.""
Lander provided the politician part of that.
On the agenda, according to Lander's office, was the campaign to close Rikers and ""other work for racial justice in New York City.""
The appearance alongside Butler came after a long day of campaigning for other candidates across the city. Nearby, two of Lander's choices for the council, Carlos Menchaca and Laurie Cumbo, both incumbents, won their races.

11,/new-york/carrollgardens/arrested-community-board-head-gave-cash-influential-officials-during,2017-08-24T17:37:27Z,CB Head Gave Cash To Influential Officials,0,0,Marc Torrence,Patch Staff,"COBBLE HILL, BROOKLYN — A Brooklyn community board district manager charged with harassing an ex-girlfriend has donated hundreds of dollars to officials who could influence decisions about his future as a public servant.
Public campaign finance records show Craig Hammerman has given cash to two city councilmen and a mayoral candidate since he was accused of the crime. Hammerman, the long-time district manager of Community Board 6, has been on a voluntary leave of absence, citing medial concerns, since May 10. He was first arrested on April 2. His case, brought by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, appears to be headed to trial.
While the board is ""reviewing"" his situation, including looking at whether he should keep his job, Hammerman has made donations to officials who could exert influence, indirectly or directly, over that decision-making, a Patch review of of the funding records found.
(For more updates on this story, and other news about your NYC neighborhood, subscribe to Patch to get a daily newsletter and breaking news alerts.)
On May 11, the day after his leave was announced, he gave $175 to City Councilman Carlos Menchaca whose district includes Red Hook, a CB6 neighborhood. Later in the summer, he gave $250 to City Councilman Brad Lander, whose district overlaps with the board in Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus and Park Slope.
In early August, Hammerman gave $250 to Richard Bashner, a Park Slope attorney and long-shot mayoral candidate who is also a member of CB6 and sits on its closed-door finance, personnel and law committee – which would need to have a vote on any move to oust Hammerman.
As district manager, Hammerman is the only paid member of CB6, a city-sanctioned volunteer panel that advises the city and state on neighborhood issues such as landmarking, land-use and liquor licenses.
The donations don't exactly constitute a windfall of cash for the candidates — the two city councilmembers each have more than $100,000 on hand — and he is not breaking any rules by giving. But they do raise questions, given the timing and recipients.
A spokesman for Menchaca's campaign told Patch that the councilman will make a donation in the same amount to charity.
Hammerman's attorney, Joyce David, did not return a phone message left by Patch about the donations.
City Councilmembers appoint a handful of board members themselves and otherwise play no formal role in the board's matters. A councilmember such as Lander, though, who is popular in his district and with board members, could exert some influence on decision-making if he wanted.
Lander has largely stayed quiet during Hammerman's arrest and leave and has not spoken about it. His office declined to comment on this story.
Bashner, the board member and mayor candidate, did not return a phone message left by Patch, and CB6 Chair Sayar Lonial did not immediately return an email inquiry about the donations.
We'll update this story if we hear back.

12,/new-york/carrollgardens/embattled-community-board-manager-extends-leave-absence-again,2017-08-23T19:58:42Z,Embattled Community Board Manager Extends Leave,0,0,Marc Torrence,Patch Staff,"COBBLE HILL, BROOKLYN — Craig Hammerman, the long-time district manager of Community Board 6 charged with stalking and harassing his ex-girlfriend, won't be returning to work within the next month.
Hammerman has extended a medical leave of absence again, this time through September 27, according to a notice that CB6 Chari Sayar Lonial sent to the board Wednesday afternoon.
He has not been working for the board since May after news broke that he had been arrested twice, first for stalking and harassment and then for violating a restraining order the ex-girlfriend took out against him.
Hammerman has turned down a plea deal that would see him admit to a lesser violation in connection with those incidents, and his case appears to be headed for trial. Hammerman's attorney, Joyce David, did not return a message left by Patch seeking comment. David has denied the charges.
""Craig, on the advice of his medical practitioner, has decided to extend his LOA until September 27th,"" Lonial wrote in an email to board members.
""As a Board we wish him nothing but the best and are truly lucky to have the dedicated staff we have in the office. In his continued absence, I have the utmost confidence in Liza, Sarah and Ty to continue to handle the day to day responsibilities of the Brooklyn Community Board six office, as well as other issues should the arise.""
Community Board 6 is a volunteer panel that advises the city and state on land-use issues, liquor licenses, landmarks and more in the area that includes Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus and Park Slope. Hammerman is the board's only paid member, making $111,547 in 2016, and has been in the post for more than 20 years.
According to complaints filed by the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, Hammerman used his ex-girlfriend's Uber account to follow her to a Bed-Stuy hotel in late March. He then made phone calls to the front desk to try to speak with her, posing first as a relative then as an Uber driver, the D.A.'s office said.
Less than two weeks later, he violated a restraining order when he sat down next to her at a Park Slope bar and told her he was following her for her ""safety,"" according to the complaints.
After news of the arrests broke, the board announced in May that Hammerman would be taking a leave of absence for health concerns.
The board's personnel, finance and law committee has also met to discuss his future.

13,/new-york/carrollgardens/councilman-brad-lander-talks-trump-subways-kensington-stables-more,2017-06-22T16:45:47Z,Q&A With City Councilman Brad Lander,0,0,Marc Torrence,Patch Staff,"CITY HALL, MANHATTAN — City Councilman Brad Lander was elected to the council in 2009 and has represented the neighborhoods of Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace and Kensington there ever since.
More recently, Lander has played a large role in organizing opposition to President Trump in Brooklyn since the election, helping start Get Organized Brooklyn, which has drawn large crowds to rallies and meetings.
Patch sat down with Lander at his office across the street from City Hall in Manhattan to talk about that organizing and other neighborhood issues. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.
You've been very involved since the presidential election with organizing and rallying. How much change can you really affect being a city councilman?
I think the most encouraging thing has been people's collective desire to get out and organize. And that's what people in the community have been doing in ways bigger than I've ever seen. I'm lucky to represent and live in a neighborhood full of people with a real passion for some of the basic values of democracy.
Sometimes the wins are concrete. Sometimes you get a night like we had on the Muslim ban when both the organizing — everybody's going to the airport, going to Camden Plaza — and the legal work all came together to win a very concrete victory that protected people and strengthened the core values of our country.
And sometimes it's a little harder. We're organizing on Trumpcare. Hopefully we'll have an impact on preventing the Senate from doing that. But you've got to organize.
What have you learned doing this over the last few months that you'd share with someone else looking to do the same, maybe in an area that's not so blue as your district?
People are organizing all over the country, regardless of whether they're in redder or bluer places. I think what everyone has found is, there's solidarity in doing this together. It is valuable to find other people, both to be strategic but also to feel a sense of shared project together.
There are a lot of good national online tools. It has been encouraging to see Indivisible and Swing Left and Flippable and MoveOn providing some connections nationally that make room for grassroots organizing. There's a temptation — you want it to be strategic, which sometimes takes a guiding vision, but also for something like this, it's got to be horizontal, people have to feel like they're part of it.
More locally, the subways. You've talked about the city taking a more active role in that issue. Where does that stand and what are you seeing on that front?
Well, it's a crisis. Our subways are the critical lifeblood of our city. They're fundamental to people's individual daily lives. It doesn't work to go to work or school every day without knowing how long it's going to take you to get there. It doesn't work to have a commute that is supposed to take a half hour that ends up taking an hour or an hour and a half.
And at a systemic level, the city doesn't function as a place for all of us to do business, to live, without a functioning subway system.
This new move by the governor to muddy the waters by saying that he needs more control is just deflection. The MTA is controlled by the governor. This is a responsibility that the governor has to lead on. And we are going to have to work together to light a fire to make him do that.
I wish he were out in front already. I wish the leadership he took on the Second Avenue expansion, he was taking on addressing this crisis. Unfortunately, he's not yet doing that.
We have to be loud and organized. There's a gubernatorial election next year. I think it needs to be, at least in New York City, treated as a referendum on the governor's plan to fix the subway system that'll involve clarity about where he revenue will come from.
It's not going to be done without additional resources. So we need the resources, serious leadership and a serious plan. Today we have none of those things in place.
Do you think the mayor should ride the subway to your district every morning?
[Laughing] I'm not going to opine on the mayor's choices. I think all elected officials have — look, it is definitely true that there is a mismatch. And I'm not going to be self-righteous here, my wife and my son take the F train every day. And my daughter, when she starts high school in the fall, she's going to walk to school.
Most elected officials drive a lot of the time, and I'm included as well. You know, once you get that parking placard... Mostly because you have events all over the place, it is hard to get home, to MS 442, to here. So it creates a disconnect between the experience of people's elected representatives and people themselves. Is there value in elected officials riding regularly to see what it's like — both to see it with your own eyes and to show that you're connected to people's experiences — of course it's valuable.
And though I drive more than I would like to, I take the subway some times. Mostly, honestly, out of necessity. But partly out of a sense of shared responsibility. So it's good for everyone to do. But what matters is building the political strength to win a real plan. What I don't want is for the fight about the subways to become posturing, visibility, who's getting credit for complaining. What we need is a plan to raise the revenue and fix the system and I want to be a part of making that happen.
One more on the subway. F express was floated and then kind of disappeared. Any more word on that?
I think the community made itself heard loud and clear. And I represent people at Seventh Avenue and Church Avenue. If F express was actually adding F express service, not just taking away local trains, that would be great. There's no one that doesn't want to see more service. And F express makes it sounds like you're getting some new, fast trains, but when you look and see all it is, it's not adding one ounce of new service, it's just eliminating half the trains at the local stations. Even people at those express stations are like, that's not really right.
Ironically, the problems on the F line have made it impossible with moving the proposal forward. So I haven't heard much from them about it. It seems like they've delayed consideration. My constituents at the local stops would breathe easier if they would say we're not considering it at this time.
Any news on Kensington Stables?
There's not yet news. But I am feeling hopeful is what I would say. Dialogue continues between the city and Walker and the folks who own it currently about the possibility of a city acquisition. And I am a strong supporter of that.
Most of the money that the city has to purchase it is money that my office has allocated. We were able to make clear that there was not support for rezoning.
There's very strong community support for preservation of a stables there and I think Walker wants to help make that happen. That doesn't guarantee anything, and until it's done, it's not done.
We've managed to preserve a supermarket and movie theater and so if we were able to add a stable to that list... Those are the things that make a neighborhood.
You have a community forum coming up on homeless shelters. What are you looking to get out of that?
Everybody knows it's easy to make fun of Park Slope. That was true before we had a mayor from Park Slope. But I do think that we have a community that recognizes we have to do our fair share, we have a role to play.
And obviously we're working on longer term affordable and supportive housing that means people don't have to be in shelters. But, we know, given the nature of the homeless crisis, and the right to shelter, which I support, we have to build more shelters in the city. Hotels are not the right way to have people housed.
So what's the best way to do that? The way it's typically been done, the city, either because a landlord approaches the city or the city goes and finds a site, ties down a site and then comes to the community and very quickly tries to move it through. You understand why the city does that — the city believes people are going to oppose it — and so rather than have a lengthy public process, they identify a site and just ram it through.
But communities would appreciate it more if they had the opportunity to be consulted in the process of siting. So that's what we're trying to do in Community Board 6. Rather than wait for the city to find a site and then just drop it on the neighborhood, we invited the Department of Homeless Services to come out, present their plan and we're going to try and have some dialogue about what makes a good site.
And in the ideal world, we'll be able to do it in a collaborative way in a way that involves some community engagement and planning. And hopefully that means we get a good site, can get a good operator, can stop using the hotels.
There's no guarantee, but it's the right process to try.
And finally, in Gowanus, you keep pushing for new feedback on the Plan Gowanus site. What kind of feedback are you looking for and what do you want to see from the community about Gowanus?
We're trying to provide opportunities for people to participate in many ways. There are obviously some big public meetings, so people can come to the public meetings. And the city has some new online tools that mean people who don't have the time to come to meetings can pitch in what they think.
I think it's been fascinating to see what people put. Some very predictable things. Some people are concerned about the loss of mix of uses, about density, flooding, school seats.
But then there's stuff that comes through, and I highlighted this in the email we sent out, about the person who likes to sit on the benches at the Lowe's esplanade and watch the scrap metal operation that uses a barge on the other side of the canal. To me, that really captures something. On one end, you think it's kind of funny and think, who really goes to Lowe's and sits on the esplanade? But on the other hand, it is a piece of what people like about the canal.
So, we're getting a lot of good feedback. I would invite people to keep giving feedback online. There will be some more public meetings in the fall.
I think by the end of the year, city planning will have a framework to bring us that I hope and believe will represent all this feedback. There are some things everybody agrees on. And there are some things around which there are some significant disagreement. But those things are being aired in a very public way.

Harrigan in Cobble Hill at noon on Thursday for ""National Pollinator Week.""
Adams will sign a pledge to make Brooklyn the largest city in the country to commit to saving the monarch butterfly. According to Adams' office, that species has declined in population by 90 percent over the last 20 years.
While a press release from Adams' office made it seem like the borough president may be donning a bee costume himself, a spokesman said that it will, indeed, just be the kids in costume.
Either way, Patch is there. Watch it here:

Big Bus Tours drivers were using Henry Street to get to their re-fueling station in Red Hook, which was causing traffic problems and even total jams when buses would get stuck making tight turns.
So, representatives from the Cobble Hill Association reached out to State Sen. Daniel Squadron's office, which has been a big help for the group with other issues involving big companies, most notably at the old Long Island College Hospital site.
""This is not just a quality of life issue but a serious safety concern,"" Amy Breedlove, president of the Cobble Hill Association, told Patch. ""These trucks and buses cannot make the turns and go up on sidewalks and curbs. We fear for children and pedestrians waiting to cross. These large vehicles also, on occasion, hit parked cars and vans.""
Squadron's office then went to Big Bus Tours and told them what was happening. The company told its drivers to stop driving down the street and installed ""geo-fence"" technology to enforce the new rule.
Basically, the buses are installed with GPS systems that will alert management if a bus uses that now-forbidden route. As of the beginning of this week, the bus company said it hadn't had any more violations, according to Squadron's office.
""It's great that millions visit our city and borough from across the world each year, but quality of life in our neighborhoods can't be sacrificed as a result,"" Squadron told the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.
""Big Bus Tours is working with my office and the community to ensure its tour buses stay off streets that can't handle them.""

Gives Cringe-Worthy Song Renditions,0,0,Marc Torrence,Patch Staff,"ALBANY, NY — Anyone who's tried to score tickets to a major event knows the struggle. You see that tickets are sold out, only to have popped up on re-sale sites for four or five times as much as the venue was originally selling them for.
State Sen. Daniel Squadron took the floor in Albany on Thursday to fight against that struggle. The state legislature was considering a bill that would extend the status-quo of ticketing procedures in New York state.
Squadron — whose district is an impressive contortion that includes parts of lower Manhattan, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Heights, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Williamsburg (full map here) — has pushed for tougher legislation that would require disclosure of face value prices, actual number of tickets available and more.
So Squadron is a solid no.
On the Senate floor Thursday, he chose to express so through (sometimes cringe-worthy) parodies of song lyrics from recent hits. (Something he's done before.)
A sampling of this year's diss tracks included:
(Beyonce, ""Single Ladies"")
(Lady Gaga, ""Bad Romance"")
(Adele, ""Rolling In The Deep"")
There was a lot more, too. You can watch his entire riff below. (Oh, and the extender was passed 36-24.)

17,/new-york/carrollgardens/stalking-head-brooklyn-community-board-leaves-weird-online-trail-ahead-court,2017-06-05T21:35:44Z,‘Stalking' Head Of BK CB Leaves Weird Online Trail,0,0,Marc Torrence,Patch Staff,"CARROLL GARDENS, BROOKLYN — The long-time district manager of Brooklyn's Community Board 6 is due back in court Friday on charges that he stalked and harassed an ex-girlfriend and then broke a restraining order against him.
Craig Hammerman is in the middle of a 60-day voluntary unpaid leave of absence from the board, an advisory panel that liaises with the city on local issues such as bike lanes, landmarks and liquor licenses for the neighborhoods of Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus and Park Slope.
As district manager, Hammerman is the only paid member of the board. He made $111,547 in 2016, city records show, and he's held the position for more than 20 years.
Since taking his leave in the middle of May, Hammerman has taken to Facebook to check in to the bar where he's accused of violating his restraining order and posted a cryptic photo of his desk in the district office.
According to complaints filed by the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, Hammerman used his ex-girlfriend's Uber account to follow her to a Bed-Stuy hotel in late March, then made phone calls to the front desk using fake identities to try to speak to her. Hammerman has denied any wrongdoing.
Then, less than two weeks later, he violated a restraining order when he sat down next to her at a Park Slope bar and told her he was following her for her ""safety,"" according to the complaints.
Hammerman checked in at that bar, The Gate, on May 16, nearly a week after his leave from the board was announced:
Hammerman's attorney, Joyce David, has told Patch that Hammerman is a regular there and that his ex-girlfriend ""set him up"" by showing up there when she knew there was a restraining order out for him.
The lawyer did not immediately return a phone message left by Patch on Monday seeking comment.
The community board said it is ""reviewing"" Hammerman's conduct and ""considering"" action against him, but he seems confident that he'll be back in his old job in no time.
The same night he checked into the bar, Hammerman posted a picture of his desk at the district office with the caption ""#seeyousoon.""
Hammerman apparently plans to spend the rest of his 60-day leave in the desert. On Monday afternoon, he took to Facebook again to announce ""It's official. Flight booked. Am heading to the desert for a month. Leaving Saturday. Spirit healing and soul cleansing.""
Sayar Lonial, the chair of the community board, told Patch in an email on Monday that the board's closed-door personnel, finance and law committee had not yet held another meeting to discuss Hammerman's status with the board.
And in Hammerman's absence, he said, ""The District office staff has been great and the office is running smoothly.""

Blast 'Phony' No-Parking Signs,0,0,Marc Torrence,Patch Staff,"COBBLE HILL, BROOKLYN — A group of Brooklyn politicians this week blasted a real estate firm that they say put up ""illegal"" and ""phony"" no-parking signs near the site of a hospital redevelopment in Cobble Hill.
The signs cropped up around March, according to the Cobble Hill Association, and drivers were ticketed for violations they never committed. The group, which includes City Councilman Brad Lander and state Senator Daniel Squadron, wrote a letter to the Department of Transportation asking that any fines that came from the ""illegal parking scheme"" be reimbursed.
""Fortis's phony parking signs are another in a long string of offenses against the community -- from moving forward with a bad development plan where a hospital once stood, to unsafe construction practices and beyond,"" Squadron said in a statement to Patch. ""It's important fines be refunded and reversed, and Fortis be held accountable.""
A spokesman for Fortis Property Group, which is turning the former site of the Long Island College Hospital into luxury condos, did not immediately return a Patch request for comment.
(For more Cobble Hill news, click here to get Patch's daily newsletter and free, real-time news alerts.)
""Big thanks to the Cobble Hill Association for their effective advocacy and partnership, and to the NYC Department of Transportation for holding Fortis accountable for their disregard for the community,"" Lander said in a statement. ""We will continue to work together to ensure wrongfully-issued tickets are dismissed--and prevent the developer from trespassing in our neighborhood.""
According to the letter, the DOT told the group of politicians that it did ""not have any authorized temporary signs on Henry Street between Pacific and Amity at this time."" DOT also said it issued a Notice of Violation to the site, but the politicians want an inspector's report of the site made public.
The Cobble Hill Association sent Patch photos from the site, one of which you can see above. They also sent a close-up of a similar sign posted at a nearby construction site:
