Originally published on Wednesday, February 26
Everyone around him saw this coming.
No one managed to stop it.
For years, family members of James Mark Rippee — a blind, homeless Vacaville man with a traumatic brain injury and paranoid schizophrenia — have fought to get him into treatment. He resisted. And official after official cited California's involuntary treatment laws in explaining to his family why there was nothing they could do.
On the evening of February 12th, Rippee stepped off the center divide of a dimly lit Vacaville street into the path of an oncoming vehicle, police say. Now he's facing multiple surgeries, said his sister Linda Privatte — for a fractured skull, a brain bleed, a shattered elbow, a dislocated shoulder and a crushed leg.
Like many other families, Rippee's sisters place much of the blame on the mental health implications of a 1967 state law, Lanterman-Petris-Short. It imposed specific timeframes for involuntary confinement and limited involuntary holds to those deemed a danger to themselves or others, or gravely disabled.
But families like Rippee's are ratcheting up the pressure to change the controversial law.
And policymakers seem to be listening. Last week Gov. Gavin Newsom, in his State of the State address, said: ""Clearly it's time to respond to the concerns of experts who argue that thresholds for conservatorships are too high and need to be revisited.""
After watching the speech, Rippee's sisters aren't yet convinced. They've been circulating a petition begging the governor to pay attention to Rippee's situation and act to help him.
""It's easy to stand up and say what needs to happen,"" Privatte said. ""What is he really going to do about it? What's the plan? I watched it twice, and I didn't hear one.""
An audit of Lanterman-Petris-Short is due out later this spring, and could suggest a possible path forward for the state. The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment or provide any details about what exactly he would do to respond to change the rules surrounding involuntary treatment of people with mental illness. While the governor has not yet outlined a specific plan for the state, he did sign a bill to pilot expanded conservatorships in San Francisco.
Privatte and her twin sister, Catherine Hanson, recognize that making it easier to conserve people isn't a simple fix, either. Disability rights advocates are concerned that involuntary treatment is ineffective and jeopardizes people's civil rights. County public guardians say they are overwhelmed with an influx of new clients, while the number of facilities available to treat them shrinks.
Even if Rippee were to be conserved, very few facilities in the state accept patients with traumatic brain injuries, Gerald Huber, the county's director of Health and Social Services, said in an interview late last year.
Rippee himself, when I found him huddled at the edge of a Vallejo strip mall last year, told me he wants to live in a home with a shower and someone to care for him. But not a locked facility, he emphasized.
""To leave a blind man outside, you know, I just figured the county could do better than that,"" he said.
This was not the first time Rippee has wandered into traffic. People who know his family regularly reach out to tell them they have pulled him out of danger, or have themselves almost hit him. In September, he was struck by a car and ended up hospitalized with a brain abscess. But after a couple weeks, his sisters said, the hospital discharged him to a board-and-care. Soon after that, he returned to the streets.
Lt. Mark Donaldson, of the Vacaville police department, said his officers regularly respond to calls about Rippee stepping into traffic.
""You have to go out and deal with these same people over and over again, and you know what the end result is going to be, because there's no place to take them,"" he said.
""I got into this job to help people above all else, and we like to be problem solvers, and when you simply don't have the tools to solve these problems, it's devastating,"" he said. ""It's so frustrating. Your heart hurts for him and his family. There simply is no place; there's nothing we can do.""
Privatte says she doesn't blame the driver who struck her brother earlier this month.
""I just blame the whole situation of him still being out there,"" Privatte said.
""Sometimes I'm just amazed at how he does survive.""
She and Hanson say their brother has refused necessary medical treatments while in the hospital, including blood transfusions.
Rippee's sisters have been fighting to get him into involuntary treatment for years. They testified on behalf of state legislation that sought to redefine ""gravely disabled"" to include those who don't seek needed medical treatment. It failed. They attended Solano County board of supervisors meetings. They asked the police for welfare checks. They sent thousands of emails, and administer a Facebook group about their brother's situation, which currently has more than 2,500 members.
""What we're doing is unacceptable,"" Solano County Supervisor Skip Thomson told Privatte as she wept during a board of supervisors meeting in 2018. Thomson declined to comment on Rippee's most recent accident.
""I've struggled with this for the five years I've been here,"" Huber, the county's director of Health and Social Services, said last year. ""The street is not an appropriate place for him to live.""

In addition to the presidential primary, California voters are deciding on Proposition 13, the largest bond in state history. And for Dixon voters, there's a race among candidates for Congress, District 3.
Dixon residents who skipped the vote-by-mail option in favor of voting at the polls this Election Day should have a sample ballot that came in the mail and lists their designated polling place. Misplaced your sample ballot? That's OK. Between the county and the state, there are several ways to look up your polling place.
Here's the link to the Solano County Registrar of Voters' polling place finder. Plus, registered voters —and those seeking to register AND vote on Election Day— can also cast their ballots from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, March 3 at the Solano County Registrar of Voters' Office, 675 Texas St., Suite 2600 in Fairfield.
Here are some other ways to find your polling place:

2,/california/dixon/heres-how-dixon-nearby-lawmakers-voted-impeaching-trump,2019-12-20T03:06:46Z,How Your Congress Member Voted On Impeaching Trump,0,0,Maggie Fusek,Patch Staff,"DIXON, CA — Dixon's congressional representative, Democrat John Garamendi, voted with his party during Wednesday's U.S. House of Representatives' vote to approve two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump and charge him with abusing his office and obstructing Congress.
The nation's 45th president became just the third person in the office to be impeached. He now faces trial in the Senate and the unlikely possibility of being removed from office for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""
Last week, a bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee approved two articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress. However, given the Senate is controlled by Republicans, it's considered highly unlikely.
Impeachment is not a conviction, rather the rough equivalent of a grand jury issuing indictments. Senators act as judge and jury.
California has 55 members of Congress and 48 of those members belong to the Democratic Party.
Here's how lawmakers for Dixon and surrounding areas voted on both articles of impeachment, as well as what they had to say about it:
U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, Third District
Garamendi, a Democrat whose district encompasses Yolo County and parts of Solano County — including Dixon and Suisun City — said he voted in favor of both articles of impeachment to ""preserve and protect our Constitution and my promise to my constituents to carefully analyze all issues before me.""
""Impeaching a President is one of the most solemn and consequential decisions the United States Congress can make. It is not an action I, or my fellow House colleagues, take lightly. Impeachment exists to protect our democracy. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, the impeachment clause in the Constitution exists to address 'the misconduct of public men,' which involves 'the abuse or violation of some public trust.'
""The investigations and hearings conducted by the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees provide overwhelming evidence that President Trump abused his power of office and endangered our national security when he coerced the president of Ukraine into investigating his likely rival in the 2020 presidential election by withholding $391 million in critical military aid and a White House meeting from the Ukrainian government. Withholding this military assistance to Ukraine as it enters the fifth year of its deadly war against Russia endangers Ukraine's sovereignty and safety as well as the United States' national security interests.
""President Trump has also issued a blanket order prohibiting all executive office personnel from testifying in Congressional impeachment hearings, responding to subpoenas, and turning over documents. Therefore, he has obstructed the legitimate and Constitutional obligation Congress has to conduct an impeachment inquiry when there is evidence of wrongdoing by the President.
No one is above the law. The President's actions leave me no choice. President Trump has violated his oath to 'faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States,' and to, 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.' Now I will uphold my oath of office to preserve and protect our Constitution and my promise to my constituents to carefully analyze all issues before me. I will vote in favor of both articles of impeachment against President Donald John Trump.""
U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Fifth District
Thompson, a Democrat who represents Napa County, part of Petaluma and parts of Sonoma, Lake, Solano and Contra Costa counties, said he voted in favor of both articles of impeachment in part because ""Trump jeopardized our national security.""
Here is Thompson's full statement:
""Impeachment is a solemn duty outlined in the Constitution and one that I do not take lightly. I did not run for Congress to impeach this President, but rather to help our community get ahead and to serve the country I love. Unfortunately, the President brought this on himself by putting his own personal and political interests above those of the people he serves. This jeopardized our national security.
""The two articles I voted to pass today outline serious breaches of the public trust committed by the President, rising to the bar of high crimes and misdemeanors spelled out in our Constitution. As a combat veteran and having served eight years on the Intelligence Committee, I understand the threat that foreign actors can play in our elections. Every elected official must dedicate themselves to protecting our democracy. No one should invite a foreign country to interfere with our most sacred act of voting. It was a severe abuse of power for the President to ask a foreign nation to interfere in our election to benefit his personal and political interest and to condition bipartisan and Congressionally-approved aid on that interference. And it was an unacceptable obstruction of Congress for the President to order his officials to defy legally-issued subpoenas.
""Unchecked, these actions could lead us down a path that will unravel the fabric of our nation. I am saddened to have had to vote in favor of these articles of impeachment. But, in the interest of defending our nation, I was compelled to vote to ensure our country holds the same values for our children and for generations to come. Ben Franklin, one of our most influential Founding Fathers, wrote that we have 'a Republic, if you can keep it.' I believe we must fight to keep it.""
U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, Second District
Huffman, a Democrat who represents Marin County, part of Petaluma and parts of Sonoma, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity and Del Norte counties, voted in favor of impeachment. Huffman said Trump ""compromised national security to cheat his way to re-election.""
Here is his full statement:
""Madam Speaker, as we take this solemn, necessary step of impeaching President Trump, my Republican colleagues have made up their minds; we can't persuade them to do the right thing. So, I address my remarks to the future. Because today's vote will be judged by future generations including my precious children Abby and Nathan. Maybe grandkids.
""Historians will study what members of this Congress did when our democracy was tested like never before by a President who put personal interests above country; who compromised national security to cheat his way to re-election; and when caught, not only lied and refused to admit wrongdoing, but flouted Congress' authority. He even called the Constitutional impeachment mechanism 'unconstitutional.'
""Historians will marvel how some members continued to stand by this man; how they put blind partisan loyalty – or fear of Donald Trump – above their duty to defend the Constitution; how they made absurd partisan arguments and tried to obstruct these proceedings; and how, instead of pushing back when their party fell under a dark spell of authoritarianism, they embraced it – as if the Constitution, the rule of law, and our Oath of Office mean nothing.
""So, Madam Speaker, for our future generations, our children, and the judgment of history, let me be clear: I stand with our Constitution, with the rule of law, and our democracy. I'll be voting 'yes' to impeach Donald J. Trump.""
U.S. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, 11th District
DeSaulnier, a Democrat whose district encompasses Concord and Pleasant Hill and parts of Martinez and Contra Costa County, voted in favor of impeachment, saying in part that failing to hold Trump ""accountable for his actions will lead to more violations.""
Here is his full statement:
""The reality and urgency of this moment could not be more consequential to American democracy. President Trump violated the law by soliciting foreign interference in our elections.
""With the President's pattern of escalating behavior, failing to hold him accountable for his actions will lead to more violations. This President is a threat to our national security. That is why today I voted to defend our democracy, uphold our oath of office and the Constitution, and impeach President Trump."""

The vote was 4-1, with Councilman Devon Minnema casting the sole 'no' vote.
The reason for the schedule change, City Attorney Douglas White stated in a summary report on the matter, is that City Council members hold positions on various regional committees and subcommittees that meet the same nights at the City Council. Therefore, changing the Council's meeting dates would facilitate Councilmembers' and constituents ability to attend regional meetings on the second and fourth Tuesdays.
Now that the Council has approved the ordinance by a majority vote, it will return for a second reading at the next regular meeting and go into effect in July. As a result, the city's Planning Commission would move its meeting date from the third Tuesday of the month to the second, and the Parks and Recreation Commission would shift its meetings from the first Tuesday of the month to the fourth."

5,/california/dixon/lawmaker-seeks-memorial-highway-fallen-solano-chp-officer,2018-12-04T20:13:17Z,Lawmaker Seeks Memorial Hwy For Fallen CHP Officer,0,0,Maggie Fusek,Patch Staff,"SOLANO COUNTY, CA — The renaming of a stretch of Interstate Highway 505 in Solano County in memory of the late California Highway Patrol Officer Kirk Griess appears to be in the works. Democratic Assemblyman Jim Frazier of Discovery Bay introduced a resolution Monday to name a portion of I-505 in Vacaville after Griess, who was fatally struck by an alleged distracted driver during a traffic stop Aug. 10 on the shoulder of eastbound Interstate Highway 80 near Fairfield.
Griess, 46, was a Vacaville resident and is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.
""The death of Officer Griess is a loss to the California Highway Patrol, his Vacaville community and the state of California,"" Frazier said in a news release. ""He was a beloved veteran CHP officer who worked in the Solano County region for 16 years. We want to honor his service and his exemplary life with a memorial highway in the community that was his home and where his
family lives,"" Frazier said.
Assembly Concurrent Resolution 4 — or ACR — calls for renaming I-505 the CHP Officer Kirk Griess Memorial Highway between the Highway 80 interchange and Vaca Valley Parkway in Solano County. The Assembly will consider the resolution when it convenes in early January.
The resolution pays tribute to Griess as a loving and involved father who was active in Vacaville where he coached youth soccer and baseball teams and as a husband, father, son, friend, co-worker and mentor.
The resolution states Griess had a heart for service that showed in the returned love of his community.
""Everyone enjoyed his easygoing nature and his knack for always looking for the positive in others,"" the resolution states.
As law prohibits the use of state funds for signs designating memorial highways, Frazier's office said the signs for CHP Officer Kirk Griess Memorial Highway will be paid for with private donations.
The crash also killed Jaime Manuel, 49, of Vallejo, when the truck hit his Saturn SUV that Griess had pulled over.
Authorities allege Sean Matthew Walker, 36, of Rocklin, the driver of the Chevrolet truck that struck Griess and Manuel, was using his phone at the time of the crash, causing him to lose control of his vehicle while traveling at a high rate of speed. Walker has been charged with gross vehicular manslaughter, with a preliminary hearing due to be set next Monday in Solano County Superior Court in Vallejo.

""I want all Californians to know their voting rights,"" Padilla said in a statement. ""Even if you have a prior criminal conviction, you may still have the right to vote. Civic engagement can be a critical piece in reintegrating formerly incarcerated Californians into their communities and reducing recidivism.""

SACRAMENTO – A comprehensive internet privacy and data breach protection bill introduced by Senators Bill Dodd, D-Napa, Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys and Assemblymember Ed Chau, D-Monterey Park, passed the Senate and Assembly on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Adoption of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 was followed by the withdrawal of a ballot measure seeking the same protections that would have cost California taxpayers millions of dollars.
""Once again California is taking the lead in protecting consumers and holding bad actors accountable,"" Sen. Dodd said. ""My hope is other states will follow, ensuring privacy and safeguarding personal information in a way the federal government has so far been unwilling to do.""
Recent data breaches that affected millions – those experienced by Target, Equifax, Cambridge Analytica, and many more – have raised concerns from internet users around the world. The continued prevalence of such occurrences and uncertainty about what data is being collected has drawn the ire of consumer and public interest groups.
With this in mind, Senators Dodd and Hertzberg and Assemblymember Chau introduced legislation to expand the rights of consumers to know what data is being collected about them online, and even to delete it. The bill would also empower consumers to decline the sale of their information and report violations, which must then be addressed by the violator or risk civil action. It includes protections from Dodd's existing bill, Senate Bill 1121.
The co-authors released the following statements:
""Today the California Legislature made history by passing the most comprehensive privacy law in the country,"" said Sen. Hertzberg. ""We in California are continuing to push the envelope on technology and privacy issues by enacting robust consumer protections - without stifling innovation.""
""Today, California took a historic step in enacting legislation to protect children and consumers by giving them control of their own personal data,"" said Assemblymember Chau. ""Consumers should have a right to choose how their personal information is collected and used by businesses. It is your data, your privacy, your choice.""
AB 375 is similar to the ballot initiative on the same subject sponsored by Alastair Mactaggart, who agreed to pull his initiative if AB 375 passed both houses by today's deadline and was signed by the governor. Some provisions in AB 375 would give more privacy protection to consumers than the ballot initiative."

Sheriff,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"From Dan Roos/City of Rio Vista:For more than 55 years, the Solano County Sheriff's Office has not seen an outside elected Sheriff. They have all been in-house. This has to change. The results of this are a stale and stagnant administration that is not serving Solano County as it should, despite the amount of money being funneled by taxpayers into the County Sheriff's Budget. For example, Both patrol and jail officer understaffing are dangerous for personnel and subsequent response times are suffering; yet overtime spending is skyrocketing for certain staff, causing the Sheriff to exceed his budget by over a million dollars.
This is one of the many reasons why I am endorsing Dan Marshall for Solano County Sheriff. Dan Marshall has a demonstrated track record for positive community change, an unswerving commitment to succeed at every challenge and the skill set to make things happen. His work in creating a viable effective solution for the broken homeless crisis is nothing short of inspiring. I am confident in Dan Marshall's knowledge, experience and energetic style to bring the change that the Solano Sheriff's Office desperately needs.

""About 10 percent of prison guards say they have considered or attempted suicide, a rate nearly three times that of the general U.S. population, according to data provided to the AP from a survey completed by 8,300 of California's 30,000 correctional and parole officers,"" the article read. ""It's even higher among retired guards — about 14 percent, similar to the suicide risk among military veterans.""

17,/california/dixon/solano-co-joins-agencies-lawsuit-california-waterfix-would-devastate-delta,2017-08-22T01:10:56Z,Solano Co. Joins Lawsuit Against 'Twin Towers',0,0,Maggie Fusek,Patch Staff,"SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA REGION, CA -- A lawsuit seeking to block construction of the California WaterFix project, or Twin Tunnels, was filed Monday by representatives from Contra Costa County, San Joaquin County, Solano County, Yolo County, Contra Costa County Water Agency, Central Delta Water Agency, South Delta Water Agency and Local Agencies of the North Delta.
The lawsuit filed in Sacramento County Superior Court challenges the California Department of Water Resources' ""flawed"" approval of the environmental impact report (EIR) for project, which the agencies claim would ""devastate"" the Sacramento River and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
In a long-awaited decision, DWR on July 21 approved the environmental analysis for the proposed project, which would mainly involve the construction of three new water intakes in the northern Delta near Clarksburg in Yolo County in order to shuttle water via two new underground tunnels to existing DWR diversion facilities in the southern Delta at Clifton Court Forebay in Contra Costa County.
According to the DWR, the approval means construction of the $15.74-billion project could begin as soon as next year. The WaterFix ""modernize a 50-year-old water delivery system that is increasingly vulnerable to disruption by natural disaster and climate change. With new intakes along the Sacramento River, the project also would give water project operators the flexibility to divert water at times of high flow when the risk to native fish at the new diversion facilities is minimal, thus better balancing water supply and environmental protection needs,"" according to DWR.
The suit filed exactly 30 days from the date of DWR's approval, however accuses the state of failing to
consider alternatives that do not rely on new diversions [conveyance] and of adopting ""ineffective and unenforceable"" measures for mitigating the project's impacts on the environment.
The suit states: ""The Delta already faces interrelated problems of overstressed water supplies, instream flow deficits, water quality impairments, and degraded aquatic habitats. This Project, if built and operated, would exacerbate those existing problems, worsen the currently good water quality in the north Delta, and drive the nail in the coffin for water quality in the South Delta, among other harms.""
Further, the agencies say: ""As a result of numerous and compounding deficiencies in the EIRs, the public remains very much in the dark about what the Project actually entails, its environmental impacts, and the efficacy of the mitigation measures proposed by DWR to lessen Project impacts. As such, the fundamental purposes of CEQA [California Environmental Quality Act] have been thwarted. Moreover, in approving the Project, DWR and DFW violated other state laws designed to protect fish and wildlife, the Delta watershed and water supplies, and the public trust. Unless DWR and DFW meet the requirements of CEQA and these other vital safeguards under California law, the Project may not proceed.""
Here are statements from representatives of the agencies that filed the lawsuit Monday:
Contra Costa County Supervisor Karen Mitchoff: ""Contra Costa County has long been a protector of the Delta and this California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) challenge should not come as a surprise. Like many other Bay Delta stakeholders, we have identified major flaws with the WaterFix proposal, significant impacts to water quality and the ecosystem, and continue to urge consideration of other more viable alternatives. What is surprising is the continued panicked rush by the state to push for a project that does not pencil out. Clearly, the enormous project costs and the lack of new water will have exporters walking away.""
San Joaquin County Supervisor Chuck Winn: ""This EIR process was always rigged in favor of the misnamed California WaterFix. The truth never mattered and pertinent facts were ignored because the state had already predetermined the selection of the twin tunnels. This lawsuit should provide some accountability by the state to accurately disclose negative impacts of the project, genuinely examine viable alternatives that will avoid environmental harm and legitimately give the public and affected agencies the opportunity to review and comment on anticipated and significant tunnel impacts.""
Solano County Supervisor Skip Thomson: ""The Tunnels project threatens the Delta's water quality and agricultural heritage, but the lead agencies have still not fully disclosed or mitigated the project's significant, negative impacts on Solano County and the Delta region. The environmental review that we're challenging today simply fails the basic legal requirement to inform decision makers and the public about the true impacts of the project, but at least one thing is clear: the Tunnels represent a major missed opportunity to find a real solution for the challenges facing the Delta and the state.""

Yolo County Supervisor Oscar Villegas: ""The WaterFix poses serious and unacceptable risks to the Delta environment, economy, and way of life. This lawsuit asserts that the state's analysis of those risks is deficient and fails to afford full and proper consideration of other viable alternatives. The state cannot simply paper over the fears of Delta communities and farmers. Yolo County has a responsibility to protect the values of the Delta, the ongoing viability of its many small local agencies and reclamation districts, and communities like Clarksburg that are ground zero for a project of unprecedented cost, scale, and uncertainty.""

Central Delta Water Agency representative, Dante Nomellini: ""The environmental review for the WaterFix has substantial flaws and the entire process has been corrupted by Federal and state predetermination of the outcome prior to initiation of the environmental review process.""

Contra Costa County Supervisor Diane Burgis on behalf of the Contra Costa County Water Agency: ""Challenging the state's CEQA document was an easy decision considering the massive unmitigated impacts to the Delta's residents, fish and water quality. Despite a decade or more of development, the Twin Tunnels proposal is still unable to capture any new water when flows through the Delta are at their highest because there is no new storage south of the Delta. What's clear is the WaterFix fails to achieve the co-equal goals of securing a more reliable water supply while restoring and enhancing the Delta ecosystem and protecting the Delta as a place.""

John Herrick, an attorney representing South Delta Water Agency: ""The ongoing WaterFix hearings being conducted by the state Water Resources Control Board have revealed that with the tunnel project in operation, there will be time when the salinity in the southern Delta will increase two-fold or more, and at times when the salinity standard is already being violated. South Delta Water Agency has no choice but to oppose a project designed to injure local diverters.""

Osha Meserve, counsel for the Local Agencies of the North Delta: ""For ten years we've been fighting to get the tunnels' proponents to look jointly for better solutions that don't destroy the Delta. They didn't listen and now we're turning to the courts to enforce critical environmental protections to save the Delta and Delta communities.""

Clarksburg farmer, Mark Wilson: ""As farmers growing wine grapes and producing wine, we rely on adequate fresh water flows from the Sacramento River as we all have for the last 165 years. The tunnels threaten family farms throughout the Delta, along with its fish, wildlife, and all its environmental values.""

18,/california/dixon/11-calif-counties-have-more-registered-voters-eligible-watchdog-group-claims,2017-08-12T08:32:07Z,Judicial Watch Threatens CA With Lawsuit,0,0,Maggie Fusek,Patch Staff,"SACRAMENTO, CA – A conservative watchdog group is threatening to sue California over 11 counties where there allegedly are more registered voters than voting-age citizens, but it remained to be seen this week whether the state will take any action in response to the threat. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, tweeted this week that the claims made by Washington, DC-based Judicial Watch were based on ""bad math and flawed methodology.""
Judicial Watch stated in an Aug. 1 notice-of-violation letter to Padilla that its findings were according to public records obtained on the Election Assistance Commission's 2016 Election Administration Voting Survey, verbal accounts from various county agencies, a comparison of the 2011-2015 U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, and the most recent California active and inactive voter registration records.
Judicial Watch says according to its data, the counties in question have more than 100 percent registered voters:
There is ""strong circumstantial evidence that California municipalities are not conducting reasonable voter registration list maintenance as mandated under the NVRA [National Voter Registration Act],"" Judicial Watch attorney Robert Popper wrote.
Both the NVRA and the federal Help America Vote Act require states to take reasonable steps to maintain accurate voting rolls, Judicial Watch wrote in the letter sent on behalf Judicial Watch California supporters and the Election Integrity Project California.
The NVRA requires states to make a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from official lists due to ""the death of the registrant"" or ""a change in the residence of the registrant,"" and requires states to ensure noncitizens are not registered to vote, the watchdog group says.
""California's voting rolls are an absolute mess that undermines the very idea of clean elections,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. ""It is urgent that California take reasonable steps to clean up its rolls. We will sue if state officials fail to act.""
Judicial Watch gave Padilla 30 days to respond, and 14 days to produce ""copies of the most recent voter registration database from each California county and city mentioned in this letter, including fields indicating name, date of birth, home address, most recent voter activity, and active or inactive status.""
""As the top election official in California, it is your responsibility under federal law to coordinate California's statewide effort to conduct a program that reasonably ensures the lists of eligible voters are accurate,"" Popper wrote.
Following receipt of the letter, Padilla tweeted that it was ""the latest in a series of coordinated attacks on the voting rights of U.S. citizens.""
The question many have posed this week is whether California should be dinged for the Judicial Watch numbers, which include the counties' ""inactive"" voter rolls.
Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters Dean Logan told The Sacramento Bee that LA County maintains a 1.3-million inactive voter roll as a ""fail-safe"" for people who have moved and are otherwise ineligible to vote.

The accelerated construction work is occurring in every Caltrans district in California and in rural, suburban and urban areas, according to Caltrans and the California State Transportation Agency.
The North Bay projects include $2.8 million to resurface more than four miles of state Route 116 in Sebastopol, $1.5 million to resurface nearly two miles of state Route 116 in Dixon and $1.7 million to place chip seal on nearly 18 miles of state routes 84 and 220 in Solano County.
The ""fix it first"" expedited construction projects are funded through the Senate Bill 1 Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017 that provides $54 billion over the next decade. The money is split between state
and local investments.
Caltrans also is expediting the design of 50 more projects that will begin construction this fiscal year.
The $285 million for expedited road repairs across the state are starting months before the Senate Bill 1 revenue starts to accrue this fall, according to Caltrans.
Projects include repairing and resurfacing hundreds of miles of highways and improving lane line visibility in any weather with new highly reflective striping that contains durable beads. Some roads in the state will
be completely repaved.
