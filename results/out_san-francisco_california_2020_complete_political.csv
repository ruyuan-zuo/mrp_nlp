May 29, 2020
Maceo May Apartments will be the first 100% affordable project built as part of the Treasure Island redevelopment plan and will feature 104 new homes for homeless and formerly homeless veterans
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the City has taken a major step forward in the development of 104 permanently affordable homes on Treasure Island with the construction finance closing of the Maceo May Apartments. Site work and construction will commence this summer. The redevelopment of Treasure Island will ultimately include 8,000 new homes, over 27% of which will be affordable, 550,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, 300 hotel rooms, and 290 acres of public open space.
""These last few months have shown us how crucial it is to have a safe, affordable place to call home,"" said Mayor Breed. ""It's more important than ever that we keep building high-quality affordable housing and supporting our most vulnerable residents. Making progress on these new homes for veterans is an exciting step in the City's promise create a revitalized Treasure Island and make San Francisco a more affordable place to live for everyone.""
Maceo May Apartments is a 100% affordable, all-electric modular-built housing project and is being developed by Swords to Plowshares (STP), in partnership with Chinatown Community Development Center. Maceo May Apartments will provide 104 permanent supportive housing units for homeless and formerly homeless veterans, including veterans who currently live on Treasure Island. STP is a charter member of One Treasure Island, a non-profit organization committed to fostering an equitable, inclusive, and thriving community that includes formerly homeless and low-income San Franciscans.
""As the first new affordable housing project on Treasure Island, Maceo May is an exciting part of the redevelopment that will provide critical replacement units for current residents, and house additional formerly homeless and low-income veterans,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney. ""The Island is one the most diverse and low-income communities in San Francisco, and it's exciting to see new affordable housing come to life with the incredible partnership of Swords to Plowshares and Chinatown CDC.""
The building is named in recognition of the dedication and advocacy of Maceo May, a Vietnam War veteran who worked at STP for 12 years and subsequently served as a board member for 14 years, until his passing in 2014. Maceo's advocacy played a crucial role in ensuring homeless veterans would be recognized and served on Treasure Island and in the Presidio, and he remains a role model today for his staunch perseverance.
Treasure Island was activated as a United States Naval Base in 1940 and played a substantial role in World War II and the Korean War. In 1993, the Federal Government placed the Treasure Island Naval Station on its Base Realignment and Closure list and it was formally decommissioned in 1997. In 1994, the City began to conduct hearings and community meetings that informed the redevelopment plan that will result in a new San Francisco neighborhood incorporating residents of various socio-economic backgrounds. The Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA) was also formed in 1997 as a non-profit, public benefit agency dedicated to the economic development of the former Naval Station and the administration of municipal services.
""Local history has been made with the final financing approvals for the Maceo May Apartments,"" said Sherry Williams, Executive Director of One Treasure Island. ""After 25 years of planning, a former military base will now begin its housing development in earnest, with the first affordable project serving homeless and formerly homeless veterans. It is a fitting honor to those who have served and who have struggled with housing and it is a fitting tribute to Maceo May, our first Board President and Swords to Plowshares' tireless Housing Director.""
""This is a tremendous milestone in the process of converting the Naval Station to civilian use, and it was important to everyone involved that this first project acknowledge the service of our nation's veterans,"" said TIDA Director, Bob Beck.
Maceo May Apartments will be completed in 2022 and is made possible by financing support from the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development, TIDA, the State of California Veterans Housing and Homelessness Prevention Program, Raymond James, Silicon Valley Bank, and the California Community Reinvestment Corporation. Operating subsidies will be delivered through the City's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing Continuum of Care program and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.
""We are thrilled to be moving ahead with Maceo May Supportive Housing for formerly homeless veterans,"" said Michael Blecker, Executive Director of Swords to Plowshares. ""I think Maceo, our first-ever Housing Director and champion for homeless veterans, said it best himself that 'former military bases that were once used to transform young men and women into instruments of war now are used to eliminate their depression, desperation and destitution while beginning to cultivate once buried dignity, dreams and aspirations.' It truly represents the meaning of turning swords into plowshares.""
""Chinatown CDC is proud to be partnering with Swords to Plowshares to build housing for homeless veterans at a time when the cost of our homelessness crisis could not be more clear,"" said Chinatown CDC Executive Director, Malcolm Yeung. ""Starting construction on this critical supportive housing project in the middle of a pandemic and financial crisis is a huge accomplishment that took perseverance from our City and private financing partners. We are thrilled to be carrying out their mandate to build 104 apartments for veterans exiting homelessness.""
Community Driven Partners
Founded in 1994, One Treasure Island's (One TI) charter was to ensure that supportive housing and employment programs for formerly homeless households were an integral component of the reuse plan. Maceo May was One Treasure Island's first Board President. Since 1999 both market rate and formerly homeless households have been living in former Navy housing on an interim basis. Well over 10,000 homeless and low-income San Franciscans have been and continue to be served on Treasure Island in housing, employment and financial services provided by One Treasure Island and its members, including Swords to Plowshares and Chinatown Community Development Center who are codevelopers of Maceo May Apartments. Other One TI members include Catholic Charities, Community Housing Partnership, Mercy Housing California, Health Right360, Rubicon Programs, and Toolworks.
Redeveloping the Island
Treasure Island Community Development (TICD) was selected to be the master developer for Treasure Island in 2003 and played an integral role in shaping the reuse plan that was approved by the Board of Supervisors and then-Mayor Newsom in 2011 along with environmental findings and transaction documents. As the master developer, TICD is responsible for all utilities, site improvements, and other public facilities and infrastructure and will oversee the development of more than 6,000 market rate housing units. TICD's first new residential project on adjacent Yerba Buena Island will be completed in 2021.

Face coverings and social distancing are essential behaviors on the path forward to reopen the City
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced that everyone in San Francisco will be required to wear face coverings on most occasions when they are outside of their homes, a step that will be critical to the City's ability to safely reopen further. The new rule strengthens the existing face covering Health Order by extending it to more activities.
As the City embarks on the path to recovery, relaxing restrictions on outdoor activities and employment, allowing retail curbside pickup and offering summer camps, there will be more movement of people outside their homes, even with the Stay Home order still in place. Wearing face coverings will be an essential habit to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus from person to person.
""As we begin to reopen, it is going to be more important than ever that people cover their faces when they are outside the home,"" said Mayor Breed. ""With more people moving about, we are tempting the virus to spread, and we need to do everything we can to stop that from happening. By covering your face, keeping six feet apart, and washing your hands, you will be helping us continue to make our way out of the crisis and onto the path of better times ahead.""
Face coverings help to stop droplets that may be infectious, even if the person wearing the mask has no or mild symptoms. By strengthening this form of protection, San Franciscans will be better prepared to participate safely in the gradual reopening of activities as we begin to move out of the health emergency.
The requirement is a Health Order by Dr. Tomás Aragón, Health Officer of the City and County of San Francisco. The Order is effective at 11:59 p.m. on May 29, 2020. It is informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Previously, the City recommended face coverings on April 2nd, and then required them on April 17th for all essential businesses and in public facilities, on transit and when performing essential work. Now that requirement is expanded to whenever people are outside their homes in most situations in San Francisco, with very limited exceptions.
""Wearing a mask, or other face covering, is one of the top three things you can do to help us re-open more, and reopen sooner,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""It is also very important to continue to social distancing and to get tested if you have any symptoms. These three actions will help build a community that is safe, healthy and protecting each other from exposure and transmission.""
Wearing a face covering is most effective when combined with physical distancing and hand washing. It is not a substitute for staying home, but it is a way to protect other people and reduce the chance of transmission when outside the house. San Francisco's Stay Home order is still in effect, and residents should continue to stay inside as much as possible.
Face coverings should cover the nose and mouth and fit securely. They can be a manufactured or homemade mask, a bandanna, scarf, towel, neck gaiter or similar item. Cloth face coverings should be cleaned frequently with soap and water.
Masks with one-way valves are not effective because they allow air droplets to freely escape when the wearer exhales. They should not be worn and do not qualify as a face covering under the order. Medical masks – such as isolation masks or N95 masks – are not necessary for the general public. These items are still in short supply and must be reserved for health care workers and first responders.
Compliance with the new rule is not anticipated to be an issue, as the vast majority of San Franciscans have been adhering to the Stay Home Order and social distancing. Many people already are wearing face coverings outside. However, the order does carry the force of law, and noncompliance is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.
Summary of the new requirements – the Health Order and FAQs are posted online.
The exceptions defined in the previous face covering order remain in effect. Here are highlights of what's new:

Plan formulated by the Economic Recovery Task Force allows outdoor dining, indoor retail, and certain outdoor activities to resume on June 15th, assuming they are allowed by the State; additional activities will be permitted to resume with modifications in phases
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced a plan for reopening San Francisco that will allow certain businesses and activities to resume with modifications in phases over the coming weeks and months. As long as San Francisco continues to make progress slowing the spread of COVID-19, meets key health indicators, and state guidance continues to allow more activities, San Francisco restaurants will be able to offer outdoor dining, retail businesses will be able to allow customers to shop inside with modifications, and additional outdoor activities can resume on June 15th. The City plans to allow additional activities and businesses to resume in July and August.
""Our residents have a lot to be proud of with how we responded to this pandemic, with many people making enormous sacrifices to protect the health and safety of their fellow residents,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We're entering a new phase of this crisis and we feel comfortable that we're at a place that we can begin reopening parts of our economy, but that is not to say that this virus doesn't continue to threaten our city. As we begin recovering and reopening, all of us are going to have to play our part to adjust to the new normal until we have a vaccine, and we'll continue to do everything we can to offer clear guidelines and precautions to support residents and businesses with the new adjustments that will be needed moving forward.""
San Francisco's reopening plan is aligned with the State's guidelines and is based on a San Francisco-specific risk model to control the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health. The plan is also informed by the work of the San Francisco COVID-19 Economic Recovery Task Force. The timeline for allowing certain businesses and activities to resume will be adjusted as needed based on public health data.
Part of San Francisco's plan for safely reopening includes requiring residents to wear face coverings on most occasions when they leave their home and are near other people, both indoors and outdoors. The public also must comply with other health and safety requirements and recommendations such as social distancing, handwashing, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces. The Department of Public Health will issue a new Health Order today with updated requirements regarding face coverings.
San Francisco's Plan separates the State's second stage into three phases – Phase 2A, 2B, and 2C. San Francisco's Phases 3 are 4 are aligned with the State's stages. San Francisco has already entered into Phase 2A, which allows curbside pickup permitted for most retail, construction, elective surgeries, and outdoor businesses like carwashes, flea markets, and garden stores to operate.
San Francisco's current Stay Home Health Order does not have an expiration date and will be amended over the coming weeks and months to allow for a gradual and safer reopening. Today's plan details the next phases, and provides dates that the City anticipates additional businesses and activities can resume with modifications. The dates in the plan will be finalized through amendments to the Health Order or directives, and will be guided by health indicators. If the City make progress faster than expected, then the timeline outlined below may shift to allow some reopening to occur earlier. For each phase, guidance will be issued to provide businesses and operators with adequate time for planning and compliance with health and safety requirements.
Guidance for personal activities and interactions, such as visiting friends, having play dates and dinner parties is forthcoming. The plan and timeline to reopen businesses and activities was created in coordination with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency's (SFMTA) Transportation Recovery Plan. For each reopening phase, SFMTA will add and adjust services incrementally.
""San Francisco's early and aggressive actions were key to the success we have had fighting the coronavirus,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""As we move to reopen, continuing to prioritize community health will be essential. Every San Franciscan can and must help if we are going to reach better times ahead. That means, covering your face, keeping social distance and getting tested if you have any symptoms. These actions have saved lives and are going to be more important than ever as we start to move around the city again.""
""San Francisco led the way with our public health response and we can lead the way again with a thoughtful and responsible approach to reopening,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, co-chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""Through the task force, we heard from hundreds of San Franciscans on the need to balance our public health needs with our ability to make ends meet and today's announcement provides a roadmap for all of us to plan and prepare for the future.""
""As we move to reopen, this framework provides business with the information they need to plan their next steps towards recovery,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""And as our communities follow good public health practices, we will see an increase in the activities necessary to move San Francisco towards full economic vibrancy.""
San Francisco Planned Reopening Timeline
The list below does not include all the businesses and activities that the City has included in the plan for reopening. San Francisco will only allow reopening of businesses and activities that are permitted under the State's guidelines. For full information about the City's plan to allow additional activities and business to reopen in phases, go to SF.gov/reopening.
Phase 2A – June 1st
Phase 2B – June 15th
Phase 2C – July 13th
Phase 3 – Mid-August – to be determined, will be more than one sub-phase
Phase 4 – Date to be determined
The Shared Spaces program, which Mayor Breed announced on Tuesday, May 26th, will allow neighborhood businesses to share a portion of the public right-of-way, such as sidewalks, full or partial streets, or other nearby public spaces like parks and plazas for restaurant pick-up and other neighborhood retail activity. Outdoor dining is permitted to resume locally on June 15th, and if the State allows outdoor dining by that time, restaurants will be able to apply for a permit to set up tables and chairs in the public right-of-way.

Shared Spaces will enable more flexible use of sidewalks, streets, and other public spaces for neighborhood businesses.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the creation of the Shared Spaces Program to support neighborhoods by providing additional public space to support local business activities. The COVID-19 Economic Recovery Task Force developed the Shared Spaces Program, which will allow neighborhood businesses to share a portion of the public right-of-way, such as sidewalks, full or partial streets, or other nearby public spaces like parks and plazas for restaurant pick-up and other neighborhood retail activity, as allowed by San Francisco's Public Health Order. Once restaurant dining is allowed under the Health Order, the public right-of-way could be used for outdoor restaurant seating.
""We know businesses in San Francisco have been hit hard, and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been finding ways to support local retailers, restaurants, and other small businesses,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Thanks to the work of our Economic Recovery Task Force, this new program is a creative solution that will give our businesses more space to operate safely, and shift some of our street and sidewalk space to protect the economic and physical health of our entire community.""
The City remains focused on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also actively planning for San Francisco's recovery. Part of San Francisco's recovery includes finding ways to safely reopen parts of the economy, including allowing curbside pickup at retail stores, and identifying other creative solutions to support businesses and their employees. Given that social distancing requirements will likely continue to apply until there is a vaccine for the virus, the Shared Spaces Program will support businesses by expanding their ability to operate into outdoor public spaces, providing additional space for required distancing among employees and customers.
The program will allow individual businesses or local merchant associations to apply for a no-cost, expedited permit to share the sidewalk or parking lane for business purposes. Examples include restaurant pick-up services, beverage sales, and general retail that are eligible to operate under the City's Health Order. Once permitted by the Health Order, restaurants could set up tables and chairs outdoors for dine-in service.
""It's an incredibly difficult time for businesses and their employees in San Francisco, and the Economic Recovery Task Force has been hard at work identifying solutions to help businesses and people get back on their feet,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu. ""The Shared Spaces program is one way we're helping to create flexibility for local businesses so that they can reopen and keep their employees and customers safe.""
The Economic Recovery Task Force is charged with guiding the City's efforts to sustain and recover local businesses and employment, and mitigating the economic hardships of COVID-19 that are affecting the most vulnerable San Franciscans. The Task Force's work is supporting San Francisco organizations and individuals and is laying the groundwork for economic recovery.
The program also includes the potential for broader repurposing of travel lanes or entire streets to support our neighborhood merchants and residents. Because these proposals would come with broader considerations such as impacts to Muni, these proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Business owners who are interested in participating in the Shared Spaces Program will be asked to self-manage basic requirements around personal safety and accessibility. Examples include ensuring a safe path of travel and accessibility in compliance with the ADA. Final details of the initiative and permit process will be complete by mid-June and program updates will be available on SF.gov.
""Outdoor dining and shopping should be a centerpiece of our economic recovery this summer,"" said Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, who serves on the Task Force. ""The past few months have been awful for most San Francisco small businesses, their employees and the neighborhoods that love them. The Shared Spaces program is a bright spot emerging out of a dark time. The City needs to move quickly to make these opportunities available to small businesses, and I will continue to work with merchants and the community to make this experiment a success in District 8 commercial corridors in Glen Park, on Church and 24th Streets, in the Mission and the Castro.""
""Putting forward clear guidelines developed in tandem with health professionals and the small business and restaurant communities will be essential for this next phase of neighborhood recovery,"" said Supervisor Aaron Peskin. ""I also intend to use the Board's legislative authority to waive additional fees that present unnecessary barriers to entry for small businesses on the brink.""
""Our small business community was squeezed by layers of red tape even before the pandemic,"" said Supervisor Catherine Stefani. ""Now more than ever, we need creative ideas that will support our neighborhood businesses and allow them to reopen as safely as possible. By providing room to maintain physical distance, Shared Spaces will help San Francisco rebuild our local economy where help is needed most—our merchant corridors.""
""We must do everything we can to support restauranteurs and small business owners whom have had to revamp their entire business operations due to the pandemic,"" said Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer. ""By increasing access to public spaces such as sidewalks and parklets, we can help businesses become more resilient. Based on my office's work with the Office of Small Business, merchants associations and other stakeholders, I am confident these measures will provide substantive relief to small businesses serving our neighborhoods at a time when it is most needed.""
""Our COVID-19 response challenges us to reimagine and repurpose how we use our streets to either accommodate curbside pickup or room for social distancing"" said SFMTA Director of Transportation, Jeffrey Tumlin. ""We are thrilled to support Shared Spaces, a broader repurposing of travel lanes or entire streets to support our small business community.""
""Making public space available to businesses is a key strategy that will help them reopen safely while mitigating some of the difficulty that is caused by diminished seating and capacity indoors,"" said Rodney Fong, President and CEO San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. ""This is a great use of our sidewalks, streets and public spaces that will help businesses recover, will save jobs, and will create a positive environment for San Franciscans to enjoy and support their favorite restaurants and shops.""
""Shared Spaces will make our City more vibrant, and give small businesses a chance to rebuild, while helping everyone stay safe,"" said Sharky Laguana, CEO and Founder of Bandago. ""This is an exciting new chapter for San Francisco and I can't wait to see it!""
""We want to thank Mayor Breed and the City for making this happen,"" said Laurie Thomas, Executive Director, Golden Gate Restaurant Association. ""With social distancing and the reduced number of customers who will be able to dine in, the ability to expand seating to outside will help our eating and drinking establishments be able to survive financially. We are so excited to help bring life back to our city and especially to our neighborhoods.""
""The San Francisco Council of District Merchants Associations welcomes collaboration between the City and the city's restaurants and dining establishments in streamlining and expediting permit options to creatively expand opportunities to assist all businesses in their quest for recovery while maintaining safe social distancing,"" said Maryo Mogannam, President of the San Francisco Council of District Merchants Associations.

Recreation and Park Department programs, Department of Children, Youth, and Their Families programs, and other summer camps and program can operate with modifications starting on June 15th
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced San Francisco's summer camps and summer programs can reopen on June 15th with limited capacity and modifications intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Department of Public Health (DPH) today issued a Health Order for summer camps and programs that is consistent with the statewide guidelines.
Under the Health Order issued today by DPH, San Francisco summer camps and programs can open this summer for children and youth ages six to 17. The camps and programs are open to all children and youth in San Francisco. Summer camps and programs must prioritize spaces for children of people who work in businesses and organizations that are allowed to operate under the Health Order, including children and youth of parents who are telecommuting for an allowable business. Camps and programs must also prioritize children and youth who need it the most, including low-income youth and those who are part of the most vulnerable populations.
In addition to allowing summer camps and programs to open, the Order clarifies that child care programs may continue operating or reopen. The City's emergency care for children ages zero to five will continue operating, and will resume regular child care programming after June 1st. The San Francisco Health Officer will continually review whether modifications to the Order are needed.
""We have worked hard to create a safe environment for kids to be kids this summer,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Children need to be able get outside and have fun while their parents know they are safe. While summer camps and programs will look different this year than they have in the past, it will provide relief for some parents and give their children the opportunity to play and spend time with other kids their age.""
The Order applies to public and private camps and summer programs, and includes safety measures such as temperature screenings and enhanced cleaning. The City will allow summer camps and programs serving children to begin operating on June 15th, 2020 through August 17th, 2020. Individual summer sessions are required to last a minimum of three weeks in duration to minimize co-mingling of children. Camps and programs can choose to run a session that is longer than three weeks. Summer camps and programs will serve distinct groups of up to 12 program participants with the same pod of children and staff.
The San Francisco Recreation and Park Department will operate three camp sessions this summer, from June 15th through July 2nd, July 6th through July 24th, and July 27th through August 14th. Summer programs funded by the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) will be able to provide programming from June 15th through August 17th.
""Summer is a magical time for children and we are thrilled that the joy can continue this summer,"" said San Francisco Recreation and Park Department General Manager Phil Ginsburg. ""We deeply appreciate the Mayor's leadership and commitment to ensuring our city's kids have safe, fun, healthy ways to get out and play.""
""Our much anticipated summer is here,"" said Maria Su, DCYF Executive Director. ""We are deeply committed to ensuring that children and youth, particularly those from working and low-income families, have enriching, safe and fun activities to participate in this summer.""
Summer camps and program will replace the Emergency Child and Youth Care program operated by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, DCYF, and community-based organizations, which will end June 5th. A transition time between the end of the Emergency Child and Youth Care program and the beginning of the summer camps and programs is necessary to make sure staff are appropriately trained and that facilities are cleaned so that camps can operate in a healthy and safe manner.
The City's Emergency Child and Youth Care program provided free care for the children of first responders, healthcare workers, and essential City employees on the front lines of the City's COVID-19 response. Over 50 sites provided free healthy meals and snacks; early drop off and extended hours; support for distance learning distance; and safe and clean facilities per Department of Public Health guidelines.
Visit dcyf.org/care for more information. Public and private service providers interested in activating summer programming will be required to review the Health Order and guidelines to learn how to safely open and operate for in-person programming and complete a form certifying their compliance. Families who are interested in enrolling their children in summer camps and programs, or who have questions about their eligibility, can find more information on this page. The Recreation and Park Department will open registration for certain populations on May 26th at http://sfrecpark.org/register. General registration will open on June 6th.

Great Plates Delivered SF will deliver three restaurant meals a day to seniors in need while supporting local businesses during the COVID-19 crisis.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the launch of Great Plates Delivered SF, an emergency food assistance program for seniors sheltering in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will deliver three free restaurant meals a day to seniors, who are at high-risk from COVID-19. The program is also an economic catalyst for local restaurants and food vendors, who will partner with the City to prepare and deliver meals.
""Staying home is especially important for seniors, who continue to be at greater risk for COVID-19. But that means many older adults also need additional support in accessing meals and groceries while staying at home,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Great Plates Delivered SF will provide freshly prepared, nutritious meals for our seniors while helping to bring much-needed business back to some of our local restaurants.""
In late April, Governor Newsom announced the availability of state funding for locally administered Great Plates Delivered programs in an effort to support at-risk seniors throughout the state while reigniting economic activity. Given that seniors are at heightened risk of COVID-19, this program is for older adults who live alone or with another senior and are unable to prepare or obtain meals while sheltering in place.
Since the Governor announced the temporary program last month, over 350 eligible clients have contacted the City's disability and aging helpline to sign up for the program. The City's Department of Disability and Aging Services (DAS) estimates that Great Plates Delivered SF could end up serving over 6,000 seniors daily.
""Access to food is critical during this COVID-19 emergency and we know there is still considerable need. Great Plates Delivered SF is an innovative City and community partnership that will address food insecurity, particularly for those older adults who live alone or do not have additional support in place,"" said Shireen McSpadden, Executive Director of DAS. ""Through this new program, many seniors will be able to access the food they need to stay healthy and safe during this crisis.""
Great Plates Delivered SF will serve eligible seniors over 65, as well as those age 60 - 64 with certain underlying health conditions. Eligible seniors must live alone or with another eligible senior and earn less than $74,940 for a single-person household or $101,460 for a two-person household. Participants will receive up to three free meals a day provided by local food vendors that have entered into a partnership with the City. All deliveries will be contactless for safety, and all individuals delivering meals are subject to background check.
In April, the City conducted a public procurement process for the Great Plates Delivered SF program and selected SF New Deal, a San Francisco based non-profit and rapid response organization, as the primary vendor. SF New Deal is currently providing 20,000 meals per week to vulnerable San Franciscans and has partnerships with over 65 local restaurants across San Francisco.
""We are excited to partner with the City to bring Great Plates Delivered SF to the community. This will provide seniors with access to delicious meals made by local small businesses.

Monday, May 18, 2020
Three new testing opportunities—a mobile site initially stationed in the Tenderloin, a site at City College, and another in Hunters View—bring testing resources to neighborhoods that are underserved and bolster San Francisco's capacity to test workers and people experiencing a symptom of the virus
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced the creation of three new COVID-19 testing opportunities in San Francisco, including the City's first mobile testing site and testing for families in Hunters View. Increasing access to testing is an important part of the City's efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in San Francisco. The expanded testing opportunities is another step toward the City's goal of universal access to testing for all San Franciscans.
Equity has been a central focus of the City's COVID-19 emergency response, and ensuring access to testing is an important part of that ongoing effort. The new testing sites are part of the City's efforts to reach communities that are affected by disparities in the spread of the coronavirus and provide additional testing resources in areas of the city that do not currently have as many testing options. Combined, the new sites will add capacity to conduct over 500 additional COVID-19 tests per day.
""These new testing sites help make testing more convenient and accessible for San Franciscans, especially people who are most at-risk and communities that have been hardest hit by the virus,"" said Mayor Breed. ""As we continue toward universal testing, it's critical that we focus on reaching communities that have historically been underserved and that don't have as many testing resources available to them.""
Any worker that serves San Francisco and who leaves their home to work can get tested for COVID-19, regardless of symptoms or exposure. Any person living in San Francisco with at least one symptom of COVID-19 or who has been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19 can get tested. For more information about COVID-19 testing, contact your primary health care provider, call 311, or visit SF.gov/GetTestedSF.
""Today, we are taking another step towards ensuring equitable access to testing for San Franciscans,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""By strengthening our efforts in neighborhoods that we know are most vulnerable to severe impacts of the virus, we continue to help people get the care they need and slow the spread of the virus. Not only does testing expansion help identify cases more rapidly and inform outbreak detection, it also continues to be an essential part of our overall strategy towards recovery.""
""Testing is critical and we need to make it as convenient for our residents and workers as possible,"" said Supervisor Norman Yee. ""That's why we advocated for more testing sites to serve westside neighborhoods. We are grateful for this unique partnership with City College and with the State to expand our capacity.""
""A new testing site in our community is a major win in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Supervisor Ahsha Safaí. ""As the zip code with the second highest rate of COVID infections in the City, I am glad the state has identified 94112 as a priority and is offering free testing to all California residents. I hope this resource helps to stop the growth of COVID in our City.""
""COVID-19 has hit our most vulnerable communities,"" said Supervisor Shamann Walton. ""More testing helps us identify those who need critical medical services while protecting all of us from this deadly virus. We have to get to 100% asymptomatic testing, but this is a major step forward.""
""A testing site in the Tenderloin will help ensure that testing is easily accessible and available to those who need it most,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney. ""We need to be able to identify, isolate, and track people exposed to the virus in order to provide the protection and treatment necessary to keep people safe and start opening the city back up. Tenderloin residents are especially vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 with many unhoused residents as well as people living in SROs with shared facilities and shelters. The neighborhood has many essential workers, people with underlying medical conditions, and seniors. I am collaborating closely with City departments and community partners, and I am grateful for everyone coming together to make this happen.""
Mobile Testing Site
The City is collaborating with Verily to operate a mobile COVID-19 testing site, which is the first mobile testing site in San Francisco. The site will begin offering walk-through COVID-19 testing in the Tenderloin on Wednesday, May 20. It will initially operate at the Tenderloin Recreational Center, after which it will move to another high-need neighborhood.
The mobile testing site has the capacity to conduct several hundred tests per day. Online appointments are strongly encouraged; however, staff from GLIDE and Code Tenderloin will be onsite to register individuals who have barriers to registering online. GLIDE and Code Tenderloin will help create a familiar and welcoming presence at the testing site.
Verily's Baseline COVID-19 Program provides a connected solution to support individuals from screening through testing and receipt of their test results. Verily developed The Baseline COVID-19 Program working closely with state and local government health authorities and other private health organizations to expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing in areas with a high volume of known cases. To date, the platform has supported the testing of over 100,000 people nationally.
For each deployment of the mobile testing site, the City and Verily will collaborate with trusted community organizations, to help raise awareness about the site and connect people to other services. While the mobile site is located in the Tenderloin, the City will be working with GLIDE and Code Tenderloin to conduct community outreach about the site and ensure the site remains safe and accessible for everyone in the neighborhood.
""COVID-19 is bringing new dimensions to the crisis of homelessness in San Francisco and solutions are more complex than ever before,"" said Karen Hanrahan, President and CEO of GLIDE. ""Comprehensive testing is a foundational piece of our efforts to understand how this pandemic is impacting the most vulnerable, and to protect everyone in the city from what could be a catastrophic spread of the virus. As we have from day one of this crisis, GLIDE will continue to step up to meet rising demand across the city, remain on the front lines serving those most in need, and provide solutions that offer protection, dignity and safety to all San Franciscans.""
""Code Tenderloin is extremely grateful the community voices were heard in District 6,"" said Del Seymour and Donna Hilliard from Code Tenderloin. ""We believe that with everyone working together we will have a better chance at defeating Covid-19. Thank you Director Sheryl Davis and everyone else involved in the Human Rights Commission Community Roundtable. A coordinated effort with all our organizations can rebuild our community, and this testing is just the beginning. We look forward to giving all of our efforts to fighting this pandemic.""
Testing Site at City College
A second COVID-19 testing site will open today at the City College Student Health Center. This site is open to any California resident and is part of the State's efforts to increase testing access in areas with the highest need. The State identified zip codes throughout California that have a lack of COVID-19 testing access, including the 94112 zip code in San Francisco, which encompasses the Excelsior and OMI neighborhoods. The City's Emergency Operations Center has worked with the State to operationalize this additional testing resource in the city.
The site offers COVID-19 testing by appointment and is operated by OptumServe, which is funded through a contract with the State of California. It has the capacity to conduct around 130 tests per day.
""This is one of the many creative ways our campus can continue serving the people of San Francisco, even as we teach our students remotely,"" said Dianna Gonzales, Interim Chancellor of City College of San Francisco. ""We are happy to be partnering with the State of California and the City of San Francisco to help secure the health and safety of our community.""
Testing in Bayview-Hunters Point
The City continues to focus on areas that have been disproportionately impacted, which includes the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. In addition to having one of the highest rates of cases in the City, there are unique risk factors inherent to many families in this community, including higher rates of multigenerational households, chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes, transient housing, and essential workers. In order to support vulnerable communities served by the Bayview Child Health Center, the City and partner organizations will be bringing testing directly to families in their neighborhood from Wednesday, May 20, through Friday, May 22, and continuing every Friday thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Testing will occur in conjunction with preexisting social services programming in the Hunters View community. Residents will have the option of pre-registering for testing and receiving a telehealth visit or signing up same day and having a live visit with a clinician prior to testing. Anyone testing positive will have access to a hotel room to quarantine in order to prevent the spread of the virus within their household. Additionally, mask and hand sanitizer will be distributed as part of hygiene kits provided along with food distribution and educational resources for children. This initiative builds upon HOPE SF and the Human Rights Commission's work to lead with community and uplift a culturally competent and inclusive approach to the City's disaster response.
COVID-19 Testing in San Francisco
As important as testing is, it is just one piece of an overall approach to fight the coronavirus. It is just as crucial to prevent getting sick in the first place. That includes staying at home, physical distancing, covering your face when you are around other people, and frequent hand washing. It is equally important to develop strong systems to respond to the pandemic, including a well-prepared hospital system to handle a surge of cases, an effective contact tracing system to reduce spread and limit exposure, and sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment for health care workers and patients.
San Francisco began local COVID-19 testing in the Public Health Lab on March 2, 2020 and has been continually expanding testing capacity. Below are a few examples of the City's additional testing expansions to date:

7,/california/san-francisco/san-francisco-releases-guidelines-retail-businesses-operate-storefront,2020-05-15T08:01:14Z,SF Releases Guidelines For Retail Businesses ,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Press release from the Office of the San Francisco Mayor:
May 14, 2020
As long as COVID-19 indicators in San Francisco continue to demonstrate progress on slowing the spread of the virus, retail businesses will be able to operate for storefront pickup and delivery starting on Monday, May 18.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced the next step in the City's measured plan to safely reopen San Francisco by releasing guidelines for businesses in the city that are eligible for curbside or storefront pickup. As long as San Francisco continues making progress on reducing the spread of COVID-19, the City will amend the Stay Home Order that was issued on April 29th to allow most retail businesses to resume operations with storefront pickup as soon as 10:00 a.m. on Monday, May 18th.
Today, the City issued guidelines for retail businesses, as well as associated manufacturers and warehouses. The guidelines are available online at SF.gov/curbside. Before a business can open, they must prepare, post, implement, and distribute a social distancing protocol for each of their facilities, and a written health and safety plan that addresses all applicable best practices that are detailed in the relevant Health Officer directives.
The Department of Public Health is working closely with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development and the Economic Recovery Task Force to develop best practices for facilitating safe pickups at retail businesses. The City is also partnering with business stakeholders to distribute the guidelines to businesses in multiple languages. Businesses can call 311 or the Small Business hotline at (415) 554-6134 for more information.
""Allowing retail to operate storefront pickup is a great step for our small businesses, which have been struggling since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Businesses that will be allowed to open next week won't be able to operate like they used to but this hopefully offers a measure of support. We will be monitoring our key COVID-19 indicators carefully, and will be ready to quickly make any adjustments as needed to respond to a spike in cases, or an increase in hospitalizations.""
""This is a meaningful step on the gradual path to the new normal,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""As we take these hopeful steps, we will continue to balance them alongside protecting community health. We will keep a close eye on the data, so that we can move forward, or pause, or increase restrictions, depending on the spread of the virus in the community.""
Key requirements of the current Health Order remain in place, including requirements to stay home except for essential needs and certain permitted activities, including outdoor businesses and activities. Additionally, San Franciscans must continue to follow social distance requirements and wear face coverings when waiting in line for pickup or inside of businesses.
Under the amended Health Order, any retail store in San Francisco that faces the street will be able to operate under the following conditions:
In addition to retail stores, certain manufacturers, warehouses, and logistical businesses will be allowed to open. Businesses that manufacture the goods sold at retail stores covered above and have no more than 50 personnel on site in the facility at any time will be allowed to operate. Businesses that provide warehousing and logistical support to the retail stores covered above and have no more than 50 personnel on site in the facility at any time will also be allowed to operate. They will also need to abide by State guidelines for safety during this pandemic.
Businesses can request that the street parking outside the entrance to their store be converted to a temporary loading zone to help encourage physical distancing and reduce crowding. That application information is available online, along with the guidelines for retail businesses.
This announcement builds on the April 29th extension of the Stay Home Order, which allows additional businesses, including construction and outdoor businesses, to resume safely, with health and safety precautions in place. The type and frequency of contact between people is relatively low when done outdoors as curbside pickup. Businesses that involve outdoor interactions carry a lower risk of transmission than most indoor businesses, and curbside pickup at these stores should result in only a relatively modest increase in the number of people moving about and entering facilities.
However, the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing. San Francisco communities will be dealing with it for a long time to come. The City expects outbreaks to continue, especially among vulnerable populations. That is why the City is building strong systems to protect our communities into the future. DPH will monitor new cases, hospitalizations and the health care system's capacity to handle a surge of patients. DPH will also continue to watch the indicators with regard to sufficient testing, contact tracing, and personal protective equipment. The City will continue to work with community and business leaders to accomplish careful, measured progress and move forward to further reopening.

The deficit is the result of the pandemic and the emergency response spending will likely increase the deficit beyond $1.7 billion.
City officials said they must close a shortfall of $250 million this year.
The projected shortfall over the following two years is $1.5 billion. That amount could increase if residents continue to be exposed to the virus and a slow recovery from the pandemic begins after late 2020.
Expected emergency spending on the coronavirus for the current fiscal year is about $375 million.
Portions of the city's expenses will be paid for by federal and state money, but both future costs and reimbursements are uncertain, the mayor's office said.
Mayor London Breed said the city has taken a ""significant economic hit."" She said more than 100,000 residents are applying for unemployment.
""We are in for a long hard road,"" she said in a statement.
""This is going to require a lot of tough choices and creative solutions.""
The city's budget process has been delayed because of the health emergency. Revised budget instructions will be given to city department's next week, and Breed will introduce to the Board of Supervisors by June 1 a balanced interim budget.
A proposed balanced budget will be given to the Board of Supervisors by Aug. 1 with the board reviewing, amending and adopting the budget by Sept. 30.

$1.7 billion deficit for the current fiscal year and upcoming two-year budget does not include projected COVID-19 emergency response spending
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the City is facing a $1.7 billion deficit in the current year and upcoming two-year budget as result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current year, the City must close a $250 million shortfall. For the upcoming two-year budget, the shortfall is projected to be $1.5 billion. These projections assume a slow recovery beginning in late 2020, but if that recovery is delayed due to continued community exposure, the projected deficit could grow.
The report released today was prepared jointly by the Mayor's Budget Office, the Board of Supervisors Budget and Legislative Analyst, and the Controller's Office. The report summarizes current projections of the City's General Fund revenue and expenditures for the five-year period from FY 2019-20 through FY 2023-24.
The City also laid out the current spending for the COVID-19 Emergency Response effort to be approximately $375 million for the current fiscal year. Portions of this spending will be covered by federal and state support, however ongoing costs are largely unknown at this time and any ongoing coverage for these types of expenses is uncertain. The two-year deficit projections do not currently include any ongoing emergency response costs, which are likely to be significant and will add to the already steep shortfalls.
""While from Day One we have focused on confronting this public health emergency, we have also been taking a significant economic hit at the same time,"" said Mayor Breed. ""With over 100,000 San Franciscans applying for unemployment and an uncertain timeline for recovery, we are in for a long, hard road. This is going to require a lot of tough choices and creative solutions, but I'm confident that we can do the work it takes to get San Francisco through this.""
""The City is working hard every day to avoid the community health impacts we've seen from around the country and the world, but the unfortunate truth is that the economic and financial impacts can't be escaped,"" said Ben Rosenfield, City Controller. ""The City's financial outlook has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and while our financial preparation in recent years will soften the blow, extremely hard choices lie ahead.""
The City has delayed its budget process given the public health emergency. The Mayor's Office will issue revised budget instructions to departments next week, and by June 1st, the Mayor will introduce a balanced interim budget at the Board of Supervisors. This will be followed by a proposed balanced budget to the Board of Supervisors by August 1st. The Board will review, amend, and adopt that proposed budget by September 30th.

May 13, 2020
Children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals can receive up to $365 in Pandemic EBT benefits
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced that San Francisco students can receive hundreds of dollars in nutrition assistance to help prevent childhood hunger while schools are closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. Families with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals can receive additional support to purchase groceries through California's Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer Program (P-EBT).
The San Francisco Human Services Agency (HSA) and the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) are informing families of the availability of this new emergency benefit. Children who participate in both free or reduced-price school meals and public benefit assistance from HSA will receive P-EBT cards in the mail. P-EBT benefits do not replace any emergency school meal programs or CalFresh. Children who receive P-EBT may continue to pick up SFUSD's free grab and go meals from 24 locations throughout the city.
Families with P-EBT eligible children that receive CalFresh, Medi-Cal, or Foster Care benefits do not need to apply for P-EBT benefits and will receive a P-EBT card of up to $365 for each eligible child. Cards will arrive in the mail from the State starting this week through the end of the month. Other families receiving free or reduced-price meal benefits but not on public benefit assistance will need to complete a short online application, which will open on May 22. For families that do not receive the P-EBT card in the mail, the deadline to apply is June 30, 2020.
""Many San Francisco students depend on the meals they get at school for their nutrition, and with the current COVID-19 pandemic, we've had to find other ways to make sure children and youth in our city people have enough to eat,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This assistance from the state will provide much-needed food security for some of our most vulnerable residents, and goes hand in hand with the other emergency food programs being offered by the School District and the Human Services Agency's ongoing work to connect people to other public benefits like CalFresh.""
School meal programs play a crucial role in childhood nutrition and encouraging healthy eating habits. While the decision to close schools can help slow the spread of coronavirus, the closures disproportionately impact low-income children who rely on free or reduced-price school meals to prevent hunger. P-EBT will help meet the needs of children most vulnerable to food insecurity. More than half of SFUSD students, approximately 35,000 children, qualify for free and reduced-price school meals.
""As a school district we want to ensure that during this difficult time families continue to receive the resources they rely on,"" said Superintendent Dr. Vincent Matthews. ""SFUSD has provided over 800,000 free meals to children and youth since closing school buildings in March. This additional resource provides much-needed relief to families and we're dedicated to making sure families know what is available to them. No child should be without nourishing meals.""
""Thousands of San Francisco families rely on free school meals as a lifeline to prevent hunger,"" said Trent Rhorer, Executive Director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency. ""With the switch to distance learning this year, Pandemic EBT can help put food on the table for our most disadvantaged students who are at risk of missing nutritious school meals. This is especially important for families struggling with transportation or parents who continue to work and can't easily make it to free meal sites.""
The California Department of Social Services has identified roughly 3.8 million children who could qualify for P-EBT. This new benefit provides a solution to feed students who were eligible to receive free or reduced-price school meals before the pandemic, as well as those who are newly eligible. P-EBT is used like a debit card to purchase food at grocery stores, farmers markets, and retail outlets that accept EBT for online purchases.
P-EBT benefits are available to all eligible California children, no matter their immigration status. P-EBT is not the same as CalFresh or food stamps. This is an emergency State food assistance program and is similar to other benefits that United States immigration officials do not consider for public charge purposes.
For more information on P-EBT in San Francisco, visit sfhsa.org/p-ebt or call 311. SFUSD families may contact Student Nutrition Services with questions by emailing SchoolLunch@sfusd.edu or by calling (415) 749-3604.
To apply for P-EBT online starting May 22, 2020, visit https://ca.p-ebt.org/
For additional information about food resources, the Emergency Operation Center's Feeding Unit has launched a public webpage at sf.gov/get-food-resources and 311 resources to help people navigate their food options, including community providers and public benefits.

May 12, 2020
Jack Dorsey has contributed $15 million from #StartSmall to support undocumented, mixed‑status, and low-income households in San Francisco.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced a major contribution of $15 million from Jack Dorsey's #StartSmall to the Give2SF COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. The funding will assist undocumented, mixed-status, and low-income households in San Francisco. The $15 million will be allocated evenly across the Give2SF priority areas, with $5 million going to food security, $5 million to housing access, and $5 million to supporting workers and small businesses.
As of today, $11.3 million has been raised for Give2SF in donations and pledges to the City and through the San Francisco Foundation. This donation of $15 million more than doubles the total contributions to Give2SF to date, and brings the total funding for Give2SF to $26.3 million.
""I am incredibly grateful for Jack Dorsey's generous contribution to Give2SF and our efforts to support our most vulnerable residents during this public health crisis,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This donation will make a critical difference in the lives of thousands of undocumented, mixed-status, and low-income San Franciscans who are struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the $15 million from #StartSmall, we'll help people get food on the table, remain in their homes, and receive the financial assistance they need to make it through this emergency.""
""COVID-19 affects us all, but disproportionately affects those who were already in need,"" said Jack Dorsey. ""It's important to acknowledge this fact and provide more support to those who are struggling. Food and shelter to weather this crisis is critical, and I want to thank the Mayor and City of San Francisco for ensuring these funds will help people directly and immediately.""

In March, Mayor Breed announced three priority areas for the Give2SF Fund: food security,
access to housing, and support for workers and small businesses, with a focus on assisting undocumented people who otherwise may not have access to social safety net programs, seniors and people with disabilities, and small businesses. The Fund's priority areas were selected based on analysis of the most pressing needs and the swiftest available methods to deliver impactful support, with an equity lens to address disparities faced by certain communities.
Many African American, Latino, immigrant, and low-income communities in San Francisco have been especially hard-hit by the coronavirus. Many are further disadvantaged by the fact that they do not qualify for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act or loan programs because of immigration status. Prior to the global outbreak of COVID-19, rates of chronic illness, poor housing conditions, and low wages were already concentrated in these groups and the virus has disproportionately impacted these groups as well. For example, Latino people make up 40% of reported cases of COVID-19 even though they make up just 15% of San Francisco's population.
""San Franciscans have been incredibly generous and Jack Dorsey's significant gift will help us meet the needs of so many residents that need additional help during this challenging time,"" said City Administrator Naomi M. Kelly. ""From enhancing food security to helping small businesses, Give2SF is making a difference in responding to this challenge.""
""Support from partners like #StartSmall is critical during times of crisis,"" said Matthew Goudeau, temporarily assigned as a Disaster Service Worker as Director of Philanthropy for the Give2SF Fund. ""Every gift is important because, as we all know, the needs of our community will grow and evolve over the months to come. I hope that Mr. Dorsey's incredible generosity inspires others to keep stepping forward so we can continue to help our neighbors in need through Give2SF's impactful programs.""
""At this moment, our community is coming together to address the challenge of our lifetime. The powerful response highlights the value of leadership, and the San Francisco Foundation is proud to partner with the Mayor to support the City's Give2SF Fund,"" said Fred Blackwell, CEO of the San Francisco Foundation. ""We also recognize the essential role that philanthropy is playing to move quickly, fill the gaps, and ensure that our most vulnerable neighbors are protected. We are deeply grateful for this extraordinary gift.""
""The Give2SF fund allows the City to support our must vulnerable populations and minimize barriers to access much needed resources,"" said Sheryl Davis, Executive Director, Human Rights Commission. ""The fund allows us to be innovative and flexible, to meet the most pressing needs. Our low-income, immigrant, undocumented and communities of color are being disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. The funding coupled with the commitment of the City to address issues of inequity, has the ability to make a difference beyond this crisis and begin to dismantle the systems that contribute to these disparate outcomes.""
""La Raza Community Resource Center is happy to partner with the City and the Give2SF Fund,"" said Melba Maldonado, Executive Director, La Raza Community Resource Center. ""Our goal is to help Latino families meet their basic needs of staying sheltered, pay their bills and feed their families. Through this Fund, we aim to serve Latino, Native American and undocumented families, which are among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. This Fund will provide hope for stability, and our work will engender solidarity and strength among community, agencies and the City.""

Truth in Accounting (TIA) released the City Combined Taxpayer Burden Report that analyzed the fiscal health of the 10 largest cities in the United States, including underlying government entities. Not only are city taxpayers on the hook for the city government's debt, but also the debt of the state, county, school district, transit authority, and more.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve recently announced that it would buy the municipal bond debt of the states and large cities. This report analyzed the fiscal health of the 10 most populated cities based on financial reports before COVID-19 hit. These cities went into the pandemic with bad fiscal health, and they will come out of the pandemic even worse.
The report calculates the Taxpayer Burden for each city and its underlying governments. A Taxpayer Burden is the approximate amount each taxpayer would have to give the government in order to pay off the government's debt. This is calculated by taking the total debt for the government and dividing it by the total number of taxpayers. To calculate San Jose's Combined Taxpayer Burden, TIA looked at the debt of the city, county, state, and other underlying entities. For San Jose these underlying entities were made up of school districts, a community college district, and a transportation authority.
San Jose $41,900 Taxpayer Burden is made up of twelve entities and their Taxpayer Burdens:
While the city of San Jose has a Taxpayer Burden of $9,400, once the debt of the county, state, and nine other underlying entities are added together the combined Taxpayer Burden jumps to $41,900.

The measure, which is planned for the November ballot, would make San Francisco the first major U.S. city to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in municipal elections, according to the office of board president Norman Yee.
The young voters would have to meet all of the qualifications for voter registration under state law besides the 18-year-old age minimum, and would have to register to vote with the city's Department of Elections, according to the language in the proposed charter amendment.
Yee and Supervisors Sandra Lee Fewer, Matt Haney and Shamann Walton are set to join state Sen. Scott Wiener and other city officials and community advocates at a noon virtual briefing Tuesday to talk about the proposal before the board's regular 2 p.m. meeting.

May 07, 2020
As part of the COVID-19 response, San Francisco will lease 51 rooms in a hotel setting and provide intensive support services for people experiencing homelessness who are involved in the criminal justice system
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and the Adult Probation Department today announced a plan to provide supportive housing for people involved with the criminal justice system who are experiencing homelessness as part of the City's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to minimize the spread of COVID-19, the program will provide housing with on-site case management at a hotel site serving up to 51 individuals who are either unhoused individuals released from jail prior to case adjudication, or other justice-involved unhoused residents of San Francisco who can safely leave jail during this time. These individuals will be referred by the Superior Court of San Francisco to the San Francisco Pretrial Diversion program.
""One of our biggest concerns from the beginning of this pandemic has been congregate living situations that are especially vulnerable to outbreaks, like our jails,"" said Mayor Breed. ""I'm glad to see so many partners working together throughout this process to help ensure that we protect public health and public safety while we adapt to the new challenges we face. We've moved over 1,100 people into hotels and we're continuing to move more vulnerable and homeless residents into these rooms every day. This is yet another innovative effort to respond to these unprecedented circumstances.""
""In response to this public health crisis, Adult Probation is pleased to partner with Recovery Survival Network and the Pretrial Diversion Project to launch an emergency housing program for unhoused individuals released from the San Francisco County Jail,"" said Karen Fletcher, Chief Adult Probation Officer. ""The program provides a platform for change with a shared vision that focuses on client needs and supports their success, while ensuring public safety. Through this collaborative partnership, participants will be engaged in case management and have access to public benefits, permanent housing options, basic necessities like food, clothing, hygiene kits, laundry cards and toiletries, and other supportive services through our Community Assessment and Services Center.""
During the course of the six-month emergency housing and release program, this facility will provide integrated resources and room for social distancing. Through this pilot, the Adult Probation Department will directly partner with two nonprofits in San Francisco: Recovery Survival Network, a provider of case management and housing support services for justice involved people and marginalized populations; and the San Francisco Pretrial Diversion Project, a provider of pretrial services that is under contract with the San Francisco Sheriff's Office. This partnership is designed to support the safe and effective transition of the target population from jail to private hotel rooms, and provide the Court with an additional option as it navigates the new landscape of release decisions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Through this collaborative effort involving the Adult Probation Department, the Sheriff, District Attorney, Public Defender, San Francisco Pretrial Diversion, Recovery Service Network, and other City and nonprofit partners, this program focuses on public safety and client success. Services will include case management, virtual classes, wellness activities, support groups, and workshops designed to help clients move toward permanent housing placements. The program will be led and funded by the Adult Probation Department.
Effective March 17, 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court reduced operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, closing 80 percent of its courtrooms, and delaying filings and trials in the interest of public health. While San Francisco's jail capacity is at a historic low due to efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, over 700 individuals remain in custody, down about 35 percent from the average daily count in January 2020.
""We should not have to choose between public health and public safety. This plan provides opportunity, accountability, and space to stop the spread to those exiting jail,"" said Supervisor Catherine Stefani. ""By providing housing, on-site case management, and supportive services this is another critical step to protect the most vulnerable San Franciscans – including victims of crime – during this pandemic.""
""Our priority is to ensure that the people who are released from jail remain healthy and safe while sheltering among the broader community,"" said San Francisco Sheriff Paul Miyamoto. ""This housing opportunity provides our partner, SF Pretrial, with the resources they need to supervise releases and provide supportive services in safe locations out of custody.""
""As San Franciscans shelter in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19, my office has been dedicated to protecting those who are most vulnerable—people with no homes in which to seek shelter. We are proud of this joint effort with our justice partners to support unhoused people, which will promote public safety and prevent recidivism by providing critical resources to people released from jail,"" said District Attorney Chesa Boudin. ""We appreciate the leadership of Adult Probation and Pretrial Diversion Project in providing housing and support to protect our unhoused population from the increased risks they face during this pandemic.""
""As public defenders we are constantly worried about our clients who are living on the streets, unable to shelter-in-place or care for themselves properly during this time. They already face such huge challenges and the public health crisis puts them at even greater risk of illness and falling through the cracks,"" said Public Defender Mano Raju. ""I am very glad that we have all come together to help address the housing and service needs of this vulnerable population, and I am extremely grateful that Adult Probation and the SF Pretrial Diversion Project are partnering to run this unique initiative.""
We are grateful for this opportunity to partner with Adult Probation, RSN and the Mayor's Office, Superior Court, Sheriff, District Attorney and Public Defender. SF Pretrial is committed to public safety and the success of individuals on our caseload. This hotel provides a safe space for social distancing and gives our staff the ability to stay connected with clients and focus on their needs as they navigate this phase of presumed innocence. SF Pretrial has been fully operational throughout this crisis, and our hardworking and dedicated team will take full advantage of the safe environment and access afforded through these resources,"" said David Mauroff, CEO of SF Pretrial.
""San Francisco Adult Probation Departments Reentry Division is light years ahead of other probation departments around the country and they provide a host of rehabilitative services. This a winning combination along with an array of housing to help reduce homelessness for participants. RSN is proud to part of the SFAPD service providers menu available to all San Francisco probationers,"" said Lou Gordon, Executive Director of Recovery Service Network. ""The Reentry Division funds services designed to help justice involved participants exit the criminal justice system with a chance to succeed and become productive contributors to society.""
The Adult Probation Department currently has 270 units across 9 buildings, in addition to a rental subsidy program, available for supervised individuals and other justice involved adults. Their most recent launch was a transitional housing site in South of Market in April 2020.

May 07, 2020
If progress continues on reducing the spread of COVID-19, the City anticipates allowing some businesses to do storefront pickup as soon as Monday, May 18th
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and the Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced that San Francisco plans to allow some businesses to resume operating, with modifications. As long San Francisco continues making progress on reducing the spread of COVID-19, the City anticipates allowing some businesses to resume operations with storefront pickup as soon as Monday, May 18th. Retailers such as bookstores, florists, and music stores will be the first stores allowed to operate storefront pickup. This follows today's announcement by Governor Newsom regarding modified statewide guidelines that allow certain retailers to begin curbside pickup as soon as tomorrow, May 8th.
San Francisco will issue details on this phased business reopening next week. Key requirements of the current Health Order remain in place, including requirements to stay home except for essential needs and certain permitted activities, including outdoor businesses and activities. Additionally, San Franciscans must continue to follow social distance requirements and wear face coverings when waiting in line for pickup or inside of businesses.
""We have been hard at work to find ways to reopen more businesses and activities safely and responsibly,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Giving businesses the option to reopen and provide storefront pickup will provide some relief for everyone in our city—allowing some people to get back to work, while still protecting public health. The last thing we want is to see a spike in the number of cases or hospitalizations, so we're going to be keeping close track of our key COVID-19 indicators and will be ready to make any adjustment needed to keep our community healthy.""
""San Franciscans have done a tremendous job to flatten the curve and protect community health,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We will continue to study the indicators that tell us how the coronavirus is affecting our communities and amend the health orders as warranted in the best interest of community health. We share the urgency to reopen and restore our economies and our normal activities, and the equal importance of doing so in a way that is safe, responsible and does not erode the progress we have made together.""
""Our residents and businesses have made tremendous sacrifices for the greater health and safety of our community,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""As we reopen, the focus has to be on doing so smartly. We're all anxious to get back to work and restart our economy, but the right way to do this for now is in phases. We can't jeopardize all the sacrifices and progress San Francisco has made by rushing in too far, too fast. We want to reopen, and stay open.""
The categories of businesses that would be eligible to operate storefront pickup were determined in collaboration with business leaders, and based on state and local public health guidance and may be expanded over the coming weeks as conditions allow. This announcement builds on the April 29th extension of the Stay Home Order, which allows additional businesses, including construction and outdoor businesses, to resume safely, with health and safety precautions in place.
As long as San Francisco continues making progress on reducing the spread of COVID-19, consistent with the amended State Order, the first round of businesses that will be allowed to operate with storefront pickup as soon as May 18th include:
The Department of Public Health (DPH) will be developing guidelines for businesses that are consistent with the statewide guidelines. The San Francisco Health Officer will continually review whether modifications to the Order are justified and will adjust the Order as needed.
The Office of Economic and Workforce Development will be working closely with DPH and the Economic Recovery Task Force to develop best practices for facilitating safe pickups at these businesses. As guidelines become available, the City will post the information on the SF.gov website in addition to partnering with business stakeholders to distribute in multiple languages. Businesses will also be able to call 3-1-1 or the Small Business hotline at 415-554-6134 for more information.
The coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing. San Francisco communities will be dealing with it for a long time to come. The City expects outbreaks to continue, especially among vulnerable populations. That is why the City is building strong systems to protect our communities into the future. DPH will continue to watch the indicators with regard to sufficient testing, contact tracing and personal protective equipment. DPH will monitor new cases, hospitalizations and the health care system's capacity to handle a surge of patients. The City will continue to work with community and business leaders to accomplish careful, measured progress and move forward to further reopening.
""Providing the option for curbside and storefront pick-up is a great and responsible step to re-opening our local economy and supporting our neighborhood businesses,"" said Rodney Fong, President and CEO of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. ""These new guidelines will keep our merchant corridors active, while also establishing important public health protocols to keep our residents safe. The entire San Francisco business community appreciates Mayor London Breed's leadership and thoughtfulness throughout this crisis.""

May 06, 2020
Block-by-block assessment identifies consistent challenges to guide the City's response for improving the conditions on the streets and ensuring the health and safety of all Tenderloin residents.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the release of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Safety Assessment and Plan for COVID-19, a comprehensive report of the current conditions in the Tenderloin and a block-by-block plan for addressing those challenges. The Tenderloin Plan is part of the City's broader efforts to address the public health crisis in San Francisco and among people who are experiencing homelessness.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tenderloin has seen a significant increase in unsheltered homelessness and a reduction in quality of life and safety for housed and unhoused residents alike. Mayor Breed directed the Human Rights Commission (HRC) to establish a citywide roundtable of stakeholders with a focus on low-income residents, immigrants, African Americans and other communities to address the disparate impacts of the coronavirus. Tenderloin stakeholders joined the roundtable at the beginning of April to identify and escalate urgent needs to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The collaborative effort has led to the distribution of thousands of face coverings, meals, and technology equipment for youth distance learning to the Tenderloin neighborhood.
In April, the HRC Tenderloin Community Roundtable facilitated the assembly of a team of representative City departments from the Healthy Streets Operations Center and community groups and stakeholders to design and implement a robust Tenderloin Neighborhood Needs Assessment. This assessment was conducted on the morning of April 28th and consisted of multi-disciplinary teams walking each block of a segment of the Tenderloin, broken into six geographic zones. Each City department used a standardized survey tool to evaluate each block on a set of safety and quality of life parameters relevant to their respective departments. The report issued today compiles findings from these assessments and details a plan to address the issues facing the Tenderloin during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
""We are committed to ensuring our most vulnerable neighbors are safe and have access to the resources they need to stay healthy during this public health crisis,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This plan was informed by an on-the-ground assessment of the current challenges in the Tenderloin and with input from the community, and our City employees and nonprofit partners who are out there every day interacting with and serving the people who are experiencing homelessness. By implementing this plan, we can help improve health and safety of everyone living in the Tenderloin.""
The Tenderloin Plan seeks to address and improve conditions in the neighborhood, with an initial focus on the 13 blocks in the Tenderloin that are most highly impacted. Implementation of the Plan will be iterative and informed by ongoing community input, with a goal of expanding to the other 36 blocks in the Tenderloin not specifically identified in the Plan.
The Plan has eight main goals:
The City has begun implementing the recommendations in the plan, and is focusing first on the 13 blocks with the highest needs. The City has already installed six drinking water fixtures in the Tenderloin—called manifolds—that attach to fire hydrants and allow for drinking water access. Starting the week of May 11, the City will activate a ""Safe Sleeping Village"" at the current Fulton Street Mall encampment, which will have on-site services and be operated by Urban Alchemy.
A team of community care ambassadors will operate in the Tenderloin taking a measured block-by-block approach to supporting neighboring community members in social distancing, accessing pertinent resources, and participate in light street cleaning
The Tenderloin Plan is one of the ways the City is protecting the health of people experiencing homelessness. The City has moved 1,053 people experiencing homelessness into hotel rooms and has established 120 shelter-in-place RVs and trailers for people experiencing homelessness in District 10. The City has expanded meal delivery to existing encampments and has expanded the number of handwashing stations and staffed Pit Stops. There are now 49 24/7 staffed Pit Stops in San Francisco.
The model of the Tenderloin Plan will be used to inform and create comprehensive plans for other neighborhoods down the road throughout the City heavily impacted by the ongoing public health crisis.
""The Tenderloin Plan is the direct result of a coordinated effort by multiple City-departments, Tenderloin residents and community non-profits coming together to protect our housed and unhoused neighbors alike,"" said Jeff Kositsky, Manager of the Healthy Streets Operations Center. ""The safety assessment will allow us to provide acute care to our vulnerable populations so they are safe and have access to the resources they need, while also maintaining the health and well-being of the surrounding neighborhood.""
""How we address homelessness, addiction and mental health during this unprecedented global pandemic is of utmost importance. I am proud of the disaster service workers, service providers and community members who have worked tirelessly to develop solutions during this public health crisis,"" said Mary Ellen Carroll, Executive Director, San Francisco Department of Emergency Management. ""The Tenderloin Plan can serve as a model for how San Francisco promotes healthy streets as we learn to live with COVID-19 in our community.""
""The creation and implementation of the Tenderloin Plan has been a community-driven process from start to finish,"" said Sheryl Davis, Executive Director of the HRC. ""We are thankful for the continued collaboration and open dialogue we have established with Tenderloin community stakeholders. This plan is a great start at addressing their urgent needs to make the neighborhood safer, healthier, and more livable for all.""
""The housed and unhoused residents of the Tenderloin are uniquely impacted by the COVID-19 crisis,"" said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, Interim Director of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. ""We are grateful for the leadership of Mayor Breed and the Emergency Operations Center in the development and implementation of the strategy.""
""As a community leader, being a part of the Community Roundtable and the Tenderloin Subcommittee has allowed me to help our families and neighbors — housed and unhoused, business owners, and community agencies — with solving some of the issues being presented in the Tenderloin,"" said Michael Vuong, Clubhouse Director for the Tenderloin Clubhouse of the Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco. ""I, along with others in the community, have had an opportunity to have a voice, provide feedback, and hear directly from the City agencies who have participated in solving these issues. While we may not always agree and acknowledge there's more to do, it's important that the lines of communication stay open, and that is what has happened thanks to the leadership of Sheryl Davis and Suzy Loftus.""

The new deadline for San Francisco residents is the second and final extension, according to the office of Treasurer Jose Cisneros.
Last month, Cisneros announced the deadline had been moved from the original date of April 10 to May 4 in order to alleviate financial burdens for people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
The new May 15 deadline reflects the extension of the city's stay home order - extended through at least May 31.
""Our community has been hit hard financially and I'm proud of our efforts to lessen the burden on San Francisco taxpayers,"" Cisneros said in a statement. ""I will continue to do everything within my power to support San Franciscans during this difficult time.""
""We recognize property owners are struggling and we are working with the Office of the Treasurer and Tax Collector to ensure that additional customer service and support are offered,"" Board of Supervisors President Norman Yee said.
On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors approved reopening City Hall between May 13 and May 15, only for people making in-person cash-only payments.
On both May 13 and 14, City Hall will be open between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., then on May 15 City Hall will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
People making in-person payments are required to bring their own face covering and should be prepared to wait outside in line, with proper social distancing being practiced.
Taxpayers can also still make their payments online or by mail.
San Francisco and San Mateo counties were the only California counties to extend the property tax deadline this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. San Francisco taxpayers who can't meet the May 15 deadline because they've been impacted by COVID-19 can apply for penalty waivers after May 15.

May 05, 2020
18 existing Pit Stops will now be open around the clock during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the total number of staffed 24-hour restroom locations in the City to 49.
San Francisco, CA —Mayor London N. Breed and San Francisco Public Works today announced that the City is vastly increasing the number of staffed Pit Stop public toilets that will operate around the clock, seven days a week, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The regular Pit Stop program in San Francisco has 24 locations throughout the City, three of which have been operating 24 hours a day. Another 15 of these existing Pit Stops will temporarily be open around the clock by the end of next week. Additionally, the City recently deployed 37 temporary portable Pit Stop public toilets and sinks that are staffed 24/7 near known encampment hot spots while the Stay Home Order is in effect.
In total, there now will be 49 staffed Pit Stop locations, with 67 toilets altogether, operating 24/7 in San Francisco.
""We have been pushing to open more staffed restrooms, including 24-hour facilities, in San Francisco, but this pandemic has really highlighted the urgent need for these facilities,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We're moving as quickly as possible to bring homeless residents into hotels and other alternative housing sites during this pandemic, but we face real challenges now that we are unable to bring new clients into shelters due to the need to social distance. People living on the street need available facilities, and the fact that they are staffed helps to ensure that they remain open and operating.""
Overall, the City has 136 staffed public toilets at 62 locations, when park bathrooms are factored in. That number exceeds United Nations emergency sanitation standards, which call for a ratio of one toilet for every 50 unsheltered residents. Now, as the City faces the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, making more restrooms available 24 hours per day will help meet demand.
""We are committed to providing this critical service that offers San Francisco's unhoused residents and others in need expanded access to staffed bathrooms that are clean and safe,"" said Alaric Degrafinried, Acting Director of San Francisco Public Works, which manages the Pit Stop program.
The 24-hour Pit Stops already are available in the Tenderloin, Mission, South of Market, Bayview, Cathedral Hill, Haight, Richmond, Castro, and Civic Center neighborhoods. The expansion will add Mid-Market, Lower Polk, and The Embarcadero to the roster.

May 04, 2020
Anyone who must work during the Stay Home Order is eligible for free testing, with or without symptoms. San Francisco takes another step toward goal of universal access to testing.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced that all essential workers in San Francisco will now be eligible for COVID-19 testing, regardless of symptoms or exposure. The expanded testing criteria is another step toward the City's goal of universal access to testing for all San Franciscans. The expansion to asymptomatic essential workers is citywide and effective today, and applies to all testing conducted at CityTestSF and the Department of Public Health (DPH) community test sites.
The new policy expands COVID-19 testing to include any essential workers, including health care workers, first responders, grocery clerks, construction workers, drivers, childcare workers and others who continue to leave their homes each day to serve San Francisco during the Stay Home Order. These essential workers interact daily with other people and cannot easily maintain social distance by staying home. For these workers, they can decide when they want the test, but it is important for them to be tested immediately when they feel ill, or have symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or if they believe they have been exposed. No doctor's note will be required, and the test is free.
DPH recommends that all private providers in San Francisco extend testing to asymptomatic essential workers. Additionally, testing continues to be available for anyone living in San Francisco who either has one symptom or has been exposed to a confirmed case of COVID-19.
""San Francisco's essential workers have kept our city going for months now during the pandemic response,"" said Mayor Breed. ""They continue to show up every day, often at great personal risk, and I am so grateful to them. Now that we have our testing program established and are certain that we can test everyone with symptoms, we want to extend to them the opportunity to get tested more easily—for peace of mind and to take action if needed to protect themselves and their families.""
The expansion puts San Francisco squarely on the path to universal access to testing. Any person living in San Francisco is already eligible for testing if they have one COVID-19 symptom, such as fever, cough, sore throat, or have been in contact with someone with confirmed COVID-19. The City also announced last Friday that all residents and workers in skilled nursing facilities in San Francisco will be required to be tested.
""To achieve our goal of universal access, we have continually expanded testing, based on where the need is greatest, and the availability of resources,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We focused first on people with symptoms – in outbreaks, vulnerable populations, case contact investigations and among essential workers. As the circle keeps widening, we now can test more people without symptoms, including close contacts, residents and staff of skilled nursing facilities and essential workers.""
Essential workers can get tested for free at one of the two CityTestSF sites at the Embarcadero and in SoMa. These two sites have the capacity to test 1,500 people per day, and are operated in partnership with Color, Carbon Health, and One Medical. The Department of Public Health's community test sites also are providing free tests at Southeast Health Center in the Bayview, Castro-Mission Health Center in the Castro, Maxine Hall Health Center in the Western Addition, and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital in the Mission. Appointments for tests are still necessary at all sites in order to ensure social distancing and reduce the number of people waiting for a test at any given time.
For more information about COVID-19 testing, contact your primary health care provider, call 311, or visit SF.gov/GetTestedSF.
""Given that the majority of transmissions of COVID-19 are likely originating from asymptomatic carriers, the broadening of criteria is an important step in achieving universal access to testing,"" said Othman Laraki, Color CEO. ""We hope that by identifying COVID-19 infections early, CityTestSF can help keep essential workers and the public they serve safer from infection and accelerate the re-opening of the American economy.""
San Francisco's coronavirus response has consistently prioritized those who are most at risk, and the expanded testing strategy is no different. Essential workers can be at risk because of their job duties, or their own individual risk factors. For example, if the worker is over 60 or has underlying health conditions, or works with people over 60 or with underlying health conditions. Those workers and workers who are members of communities affected by health disparities, income inequality, and/or discrimination are urged to take advantage of the new testing opportunity. The City will be conducting outreach to essential workers in these priority groups to make sure they know about the availability of testing and how to get it.
As the City works toward universal access to testing, the next steps will be testing in additional congregate settings, such as shelters. The City also will increase testing in geographic and cultural communities that are affected by disparities in the spread of the coronavirus.
As important as testing is, it is just one piece of an overall approach to fight the coronavirus. It is just as crucial to prevent getting sick in the first place. That includes staying at home, physical distancing, covering your face when you are around other people, and frequent hand washing.
It is equally important to develop strong systems to respond to the pandemic, including a well-prepared hospital system to handle a surge of cases, an effective contact tracing system to reduce spread and limit exposure, and sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers and patients.
San Francisco began local COVID-19 testing in the Public Health Lab on March 2, 2020 and has been continually expanding testing capacity. As of today, 25,165 people in San Francisco have been tested, and an average of 9% have tested positive.
Below are a few examples of the City's testing expansion to date:

President Teddy Roosevelt's philosophy was, ""Speak softly, and carry a big stick."" But over 100 years later, I wonder if his approach is now antiquated. Let's ""brunch"" on that this week.
""Speak Softy? NOT!"" – President Trump is not Teddy Roosevelt by any stretch. Maybe Trump's slogan should be: ""Speak boorishly, and crudely, and carry a big stick!"" I'm not making a negative judgement here, but rather am wondering if it's a good approach in the modern age. During the campaign and first year of the Trump administration, I thought that the excessive and provocative tweeting should stop. It didn't and it appears here to stay. Maybe we just need to recognize a new era in diplomacy, whether we like it or not, just as we recognize new ways to communicate that we don't like.
""Jerusalem"" – Consistency from campaign promises, to electoral success is something that voters like. If you ran on a policy, don't change your mind once in office. We've seen ""bait and switch"" too many times in our lifetimes. Whether you like President Trump, or not, you've got to concede that for the most part he's trying to hold true to campaign promises. He said he'd recognize Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel and move the U.S embassy there, and he did. Yes, there was ensuing violence; but, campaign promise made, promise fulfilled.
""Iran"" – The same campaign-to-office consistency that applies to Jerusalem, also applies to Iran. Candidate Trump said he would pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal – and now President Trump has followed through. Again, you may think it's a bad decision, but he gets points for sticking to what he pledged.
""Rigidity vs. Flexibility"" – On the other hand, it's one thing to be consistent, but what if on further reflection you change your mind? In 1988 Vice President George H. W. Bush ran on a pledge of, ""Read my lips. No new taxes!"" and he won the White House. By 1991, facing a recession, he in fact raised some taxes and it cost him reelection. Is it okay to change your mind? I ask, because in at least the North Korean instance, President Trump has.
""North Korea"" – While he held his ground on Iran and Jerusalem, President Trump has done an about-face on North Korea. While the North lobbed wayward missiles, Trump essentially said he'd blow the nation off the map if the threats continued. Somehow, somewhere (I suspect China) Kim Jong Un has agreed to meet President Trump on June 12 in Singapore, and may give up his nuclear arms program (although turmoil in recent days suggests it may not happen). Either way, I mention it because clearly Trump has shown diplomatic flexibility.
""Where's the Wall?"" -- Another area where promises may not equal performance is on the southern border wall with Mexico. Yes, the President has directed the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies to expand existing border walls and fences, this is by no means the start-to-finish border wall he promised. Of course, the answer lies in the funding. Unless Congress approves the entire budget to build the wall, it probably won't happen. In a midterm election year, many marginal Republican House members and Senators probably want to steer clear of this until after November. That's the reality of politics.
""Hey Joe, Speak Softly!"" – The ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" line has had some humorous modern takes. Then Vice President Joe Biden tried to use this line to show President Obama's toughness on foreign policy. What was meant to be a compliment, went viral and became an internet hoot! Judge for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrmbsKW0d7c
""Primary Colors"" – Four the second straight week four states held primary elections: Pennsylvania, Idaho, Nebraska, and Oregon. There were no surprises in the latter three, but Pennsylvania remains intriguing. The state was under a Congressional redistricting plan that could lead to several Democrats taking currently Republican held seats in November. Right now, it's hard to tell in a state Trump won in perhaps the biggest upset of 2016. Nationwide Democrats need to gain 25 seats to win back the House in 2018. In Pennsylvania, as many as six Republicans seats may be up for grabs, and it's interesting to note that progressive (liberal) candidates beat moderates in many primary races.

21,/us/white-house/will-may-s-primary-political-colors-be-red-or-blue,2018-05-04T01:34:42Z,Will May’s Primary Political Colors be Red or...,0,0,Mark Curtis,Patch Contributing Writer,"CHARLESTON, West Virginia
– We are six months away from the November election, but this week is a critical step in the process. Four states – Ohio, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Indiana hold primaries on Tuesday May 8, in what could be a bellwether for the nation. Let's ""brunch"" on that this week.
""Country Roads, Take Me Home - to DC"" – By the accounts of most pundits and political analysts, West Virginia is home to the number-one U.S. Senate race in the nation this year. A state that turned from dark blue, to intensely red in just two election cycles, continues to trend Republican. The once very popular Governor-turned-Senator Joe Manchin (D) is not safe. He told me the other day to expect $50 million dollars in spending on the general election, and an ugly fight ahead, assuming he beats his Democratic primary opponent Paula Jean Swearengin, a Bernie Sanders devotee
""The GOP Mud Bath"" –When any news network hosts a nationwide TV debate for a one-state primary election you know the race is a big deal with lots of consequences. On May 1, Fox News hosted a three-way debate with GOP candidates Rep. Evan Jenkins, (R-WV-3); State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey; and, former coal executive Don Blankenship. The race is a toss-up with the latest Fox News poll with Jenkins at 25 percent, Morrisey at 21 percent, and, Blankenship with 16 percent. A full 24 percent of voters are undecided, and 41 percent say they could possibly switch their allegiance. Someone asked me the other day who would win, and I said, ""Flip a coin!"" It may be the dirtiest, nastiest primary (and TV ads) I have ever witnessed. (Jenkins and Morrisey are pictured above with President Trump who has endorsed no one).
""Advantage Jenkins"" – If I had to give my best hypothesis (educated guess) it would be this: West Virginia has three U.S. House districts, but only one has a contested Republican primary. That would be House District 3, currently occupied by Evan Jenkins. There are seven Republicans and four Democrats in the primary. Four candidates are sitting legislators and a fifth is the immediate past chairman of the state GOP. If turnout in Jenkins's home Congressional district outpaces the statewide average by a big margin, many of those same people who sent him to the U.S. House, will now vote to send him on to the Senate finale. That's my $2 bet! On the other hand, the district has the highest percentage of registered Democrats in the state. It's a toss-up!
""Indiana Wants Me"" – Indiana is another key state to watch, because like Joe Manchin, its Senator Joe Donnelly (D-IN) is also vulnerable. As in West Virginia, three Republicans - including a sitting GOP Congressman - are vying for the chance to take on Donnelly. That makes that House seat an open contest.
""As Ohio Goes?"" – Ohio looked like a possible toss-up race with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) on the bubble. But the expected bid from State Treasurer Josh Mandel ended and many pundits call this race, ""Leans Democrat."" House seats in Ohio are another story. Rep. Jim Renacci gave a up a safe seat to run for Senate, and Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R-OH) resigned in January leaving an open seat for a special election. Yes, the GOP has held his seat since 1983, but the district demographics have shifted and Democrats are going to run an aggressive, expensive fight. These open seats in many states are where Republicans are most vulnerable.
""Carolina in My Mind"" -- As I keep suggesting, Republicans face challenges keeping marginal seats. Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC) barely won this seat over fellow GOP candidate Mark Harris in 2016. Harris is back for another primary challenge. No matter who wins Tuesday, Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district, and they plan to spend a lot of money to take back this seat. Democrats needs to pick and choose vulnerable seats like this across the country – as they did recently in Pennsylvania - instead of trying to win with a broad-brush campaign.
""Houston, We Have a Math Problem"" – This year is unlike many other midterm elections, which usually favor the party out-of-power. But Democrats are defending 23 Senate seats in 2018, whereas Republicans incumbents are defending only eight. And as we've discussed, Democrats are very vulnerable in West Virginia and Indiana, but also in North Dakota, Missouri, Montana and even Florida. It's possible the GOP will gain Senate seats, despite President Trump's unpopularity. On the other hand, at least 40 U.S. House Republicans are either retiring or seeking other office, so Democrats have a realistic shot to retake the House. Nowhere is that more evident than here in West Virginia where Democrats could take a safe seat, given up by Rep. Evan Jenkins, (D-WV-3). For now, I predict the GOP holds both Congressional chambers, barely.
""Why All of This Matters"" – These four primary states all went for Donald Trump in 2016. At least two of these states – Ohio and North Carolina – will be key battle grounds in 2020. Realistically, Trump needs to carry all four states again if he seeks a second term in 2020. There are trends to watch. If Republicans lose ground in any U.S. Senate or U.S. House seats, it could be a sign of a bad November. Even more critical, if the GOP takes sizable losses in the State Senates or Houses, or Constitutional officers, then watch out. Remember, the saying ""all politics is local"" means that political movements are from the ground up, not from the top town. If down-ballot Republicans take a beating (as we saw in 2017 in Virginia), November could get ugly.

22,/us/white-house/trump-foreign-policy-doctrine-may-be-taking-shape,2018-04-27T19:58:10Z,The Trump Foreign Policy Doctrine May Be Taking...,0,0,Mark Curtis,Patch Contributing Writer,"
– More and more these days, the focus of the White House seems to be on foreign policy. President Trump has had a mixed record on his domestic agenda, but like many of his predecessors, going abroad lets him act as more of a free agent. We may be about to see more of this, so let's ""brunch"" on that this week.
""France"" – It's tit-for-tat. Last year the French government gave President Trump a lavish reception in Paris. This week Trump returned the favor by hosting French President Emmanuel Macron for a state dinner at the White House. Yes, it's a lot of pomp and ceremony (not to mention great food and wine), but it's also a show of international solidarity with our allies, who have been jittery in the year-plus Trump term. I know it sounds cliché, but it gives a very unconventional president the occasion to look ""presidential"" in the more conventional sense. President Trump also gained a new Secretary of State in Mike Pompeo this week. Pompeo who graduated first in his class at West Point, was CIA Director, and has become a trust Trump confidant.
""Little Rocket Man"" – President Trump loves to call people names, and we should be used to it by now. During the presidential campaign, his rival, Senator Ted Cruz, (R) of Texas, was called ""Lyin' Ted."" In the general election, former Senator Hillary Clinton, (D) New York, simply was labeled ""Crooked Hillary."" Say what you want about Trump, but he knows something about marketing and creating a bumper sticker that sticks. So, when he started referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as ""Little Rocket Man"" after his abysmal missile launches, the double-entendre did not fall on deaf ears. Yes, many people found it hysterical, and I'm sure it embarrassed Kim, but this week the leaders of North and South Korea met at the DMZ for the first time in over a decade, and the Kim-Trump summit is next.
""DACA"" – Despite some successes, the President also had a foreign policy setback this week. For the third time, a federal District Court or Court of Appeals has stopped his non-enforcement of the DACA policy set forth by President Obama. Yes, DACA is more of an immigration issue than foreign policy, but it is indeed both. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court will likely answer this issue. If the Court rules against Trump, look for legislative efforts to reverse the decision, assuming Republicans keep control of Congress.
""Why Presidents Do This"" – Every President in my lifetime (and likely before), felt hamstrung by the checks and balances of Congress and the Federal Courts, especially on domestic issues. But all Presidents have had a much freer hand on foreign policy. Why? Well, the Constitution only requires Senate approval on treaties with foreign counties, so you don't have to mess with the often-unruly House. Second, especially since the advent of Air Force One, is the imagery of our President traveling to a foreign land, be it friend or foe. The photo-ops with that jet on international soil, with world leaders shaking hands, are gold. It beats staying home locked in an ugly battle with Congress on a budget bill.
""Reagan's Tough Talk Worked"" – ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" shouted President Reagan while standing outside Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, forty years after the end of World War II, but still in the height of the Cold War. Several months later, the wall indeed came down, perhaps more due to the collapse of the Soviet economy, than the harshness of the rhetoric. But, words do matter. Reagan was always good at tough talk (and more importantly conveying the tone that he meant business, whether he'd really take any action or not). Trump's bluster may be the same kind of tone that makes North Korea flinch and back down. We'll see.
""Clinton – Iraq"" – Not only does the Constitution give a president more latitude on international relations, the public does, too. Not long after President Clinton took office, there was an assassination plot in the Mideast to kill the man he had just defeated, President George H. W. Bush. Clinton responded by launching cruise missiles into Baghdad. ""The Iraqi attack against President Bush was an attack against our country and against all Americans. We could not, and have not, let such action against our nation go unanswered. A firm response from the first days of our Revolution, America's security has depended on the clarity of this message: don't tread on us!"" It was one of those moments where Americans stood shoulder-to-shoulder, regardless of party. Politically, it was a stroke of genius.
""A Nixonian Moment?"" – For better, or for worse, Richard Nixon will always be remembered for three things: Resigning over Watergate, opening Cold War diplomacy with the Soviet Union, and opening diplomatic relations with China. The first is a testimony to his raging political paranoia. The second and third are testimonies to his political courage, and ability to seize a moment and create an opportunity. Nixon could be brilliant, even in his own darkness. Is President Trump sitting down with Kim Jong Un on the same level? Historically no, because Kim is not of the status of China or Russia. But Trump's harsh rhetoric and tough talk, followed by diplomatic talks, may neutralize the North Korean threat. That's huge!
""How'd He Get Here?"" – A year and a half after he was elected, a lot of people are still scratching their heads saying, ""How on Earth did Trump get to the White House?"" Like many people, I have become a Netflix junkie, so let me recommend two shows: ""Trump: An American Dream"" is a fascinating four-part series with mostly news clips and TV shows from the 1970s to the present. Whether you love Trump or loathe him, it's a fascinating multi-media refresher course on where he came from, and how he arrived at this moment in time. The other is the film, ""Get Me Roger Stone."" In the end you will love or despise Stone for how he does what he does, but he provides a fascinating insight. Both programs are provocative and well-done!

23,/california/san-francisco/san-francisco-announces-next-steps-controlling-spread-coronavirus,2020-07-18T09:45:38Z,San Francisco Announces Next Steps On...,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Press release from the Office of the San Francisco Mayor:
July 17, 2020
City will focus on changing behavior, serving communities most impacted by virus, and increasing testing capacity. New Public Health Order to be issued Monday will require private healthcare providers to ensure testing access for symptomatic people, close contacts, and frontline workers
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health, today announced next steps for flattening the curve in San Francisco as cases and hospitalizations have continued to rise. The City's schedule for reopening will remain on pause indefinitely in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in San Francisco and protect community health. The decision by the San Francisco Department of Public Health to pause reopening comes as San Francisco has been placed on the State of California's county monitoring list, or ""watch list.""
The City will follow the State's restrictions for counties on the watch list, while continuing its work to slow the spread of the virus. Key strategies include increasing public outreach to change San Franciscans' behavior, focusing on communities most impacted by the virus, and expanding access to testing. The Department of Public Health will be issuing a new Health Order requiring private health care providers to expand testing, including to require that symptomatic people those with close contacts of confirmed cases access to same day testing. The Department of Public Health has expanded testing recently in the Bayview, Tenderloin, Mission and other impacted communities in the last week, and will continue that work to provide more testing access in areas of need.
""We are living with COVID, and we all need to do our part to take basic steps to get this virus under control immediately,"" said Mayor London Breed. ""If we want our schools to reopen, if we want to our small businesses to be able to operate, we all need to do the basics: limit our gatherings, cover your face in public, and wash your hands. We also know that we need to see more testing if we are going to identify cases quickly. This requires the entire healthcare system to expand access so when people need a test, they can get one. San Francisco has flattened the curve before, and we can do it again.""
""In the past weeks, San Francisco has been experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations that have forced us to pause our reopening plans, increase our testing and contact tracing and care for many more COVID positive patients,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We need to focus on these key strategies so San Francisco residents, businesses, the health care system and the City are all working together toward one single purpose. Together, we have the opportunity to flatten the curve once again, if we act now.""
Next Steps for Flattening the Curve in San Francisco
Pausing Reopening
San Francisco is experiencing a surge of cases and hospitalizations, and reopening cannot continue until the spread of the virus has slowed once again. The pause in reopening businesses and activities will continue until San Francisco Key Public Health Indicators improve, and none of them are in red, or ""high-alert."" In addition to the health indicators, other data will inform the decision on how to proceed, including the Reproductive Rate of the virus, the State's actions, and the impact of the virus in the Bay Area region.
Following the State's Requirements
As of today, San Francisco is on the State's watch list due to rising hospitalizations. This means that San Francisco must abide by the State's restrictions, which includes closing indoor malls and non-essential offices, and continue the paused reopening, at least until the State lifts its restrictions. Indoor malls and non-essential offices must close, except for minimum basic operations, effective Monday, July 20. If the State adds more restrictions for counties on the watch list, San Francisco will abide by those restrictions as well. If local conditions do not improve, San Francisco maintains the ability to close additional businesses and activities that go beyond the State's requirements.
Changing Behaviors – Face Coverings and Reduced Gatherings
In order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the short-term and adapt to living with the virus until there is a vaccine, San Franciscans need to redouble their efforts to consistently wear face coverings and limit gatherings with people not in their household. Research shows that if the vast majority of people wear masks that cover their nose and mouth, San Franciscans can effectively slow the spread of the virus and save lives. Many of the new cases of COVID-19 that are part of the current surge are the result of social gatherings among family members and friends, so it is important that San Franciscans limit such gatherings as much as possible. In addition to these behavioral changes, everyone must continue practicing social distancing, hand washing, and staying home as much as possible.
Focus on Equity and Impacted Communities
San Francisco has focused on equity and addressing the disparate impacts of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. As part of the City's five-point plan, San Francisco will continue to focus on the communities most impacted by the virus, especially members of the Latino community, people who must leave home to work, Black and African American residents, and the eastern and southeastern neighborhoods. This focus includes expanding access to COVID-19 testing and conducting targeted community outreach in impacted communities. For example, this week, San Francisco opened a new testing site at the Potrero Hill Health Center, adding to a recent expansion of testing options in the Tenderloin, Mission, Sunnydale and Bayview.
Expanding Access to Testing
The City continues to meet its testing goals, however in the current surge it has taken longer for people to access testing appointments and receive their results. In an effort to address this challenge, the City will issue a Health Order on Monday requiring private health care providers to increase their testing services by providing same-day testing for patients with symptoms and close contacts of confirmed COVID cases. Additionally, private hospitals and clinics must provide testing to asymptomatic workers in jobs where they have more risk of exposure, such as health care, first responders, and jobs with frequent public interactions at less than six-feet apart. Staff and residents of congregate settings also must be provided testing if requested.
The goal of this Health Order is to more fairly distribute testing across city providers and ease the demand on City-run sites so that residents who are uninsured or are members of impacted communities are able to get tested in a timely manner.

24,/california/san-francisco/san-francisco-continues-pause-reopening-coronavirus-activity-increases,2020-07-16T06:20:27Z,San Francisco Continues To Pause Reopening As...,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Press release from the Office of the San Francisco Mayor:
July 15, 2020
Personal services, such as hair and nail salons, will not open at this time
San Francisco, CA – Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced that the City will again extend the pause on the reopening that began on June 29. The key indicators of COVID-19 activity in San Francisco show that a surge of cases and hospitalizations is under way, and it must be brought under control before reopening can continue.
Given the data on rising transmission of COVID-19, personal services such as haircuts, massages, tattoos and body piercing, manicures and pedicures will not be allowed to reopen at this time.
Other activities and businesses that were previously scheduled to reopen either June 29 or July 13 remain on pause. These include indoor dining, outdoor bars without food, indoor museums and aquariums, outdoor swimming pools, and real estate open houses by appointment. The City will provide another update on reopening and key health indicators on Friday, July 17.
Businesses and activities that are currently allowed may continue operating, but the City urges all San Franciscans to renew their commitment to safety precautions, to avoiding all unnecessary gatherings, and to wearing face coverings every time they leave home.
""San Franciscans did a great job following the Stay Home Order this spring, and we must keep up the good work to get the spread of COVID-19 under control. We are in this for the long haul, and we can't afford to lose focus,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We want businesses to be able to safely reopen—and stay open—but to do that, we need everyone to do their part. Wear a mask when you go out and avoid gatherings as much as possible. It's up to all of us to contain the virus so that we can continue moving forward as a city.""
The State of California on Monday, July 13, responded to the increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations by restricting statewide many of the same activities that are on pause in San Francisco. The focus is mainly on indoor activities where households mix and it is more difficult to ensure that people are following safety precautions like face covering and physical distancing. While San Francisco is not on the state watch list at this time, other Bay Area counties are; because our region is so interconnected, a regional approach is key to slowing the spread of COVID-19.
As of this morning, San Francisco had recorded 4,696 cases of COVID-19 and 50 deaths. One of the key indicators of COVID-19 prevalence in the City, the number of new cases per day per 100,000 people, had risen to 7.7, well above the goal of 1.8 and a sharp rise since we began reopening on May 18, when it was 3.5. The rate of increase in hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients, which does not include transfer patients from other counties, is also a key indicator that affects the pace of reopening. Our goal is to keep that rate below 10%, and today's indicator shows an increase of 33%. Our hospital capacity, which includes the percentage of acute care and ICU beds that are available, is currently within the acceptable range at 27% for acute care beds and 28% for ICU, but could be quickly filled in an extended surge of COVID-19 cases.
Modeling indicates that the reproductive rate of the virus in San Francisco is above 1 and increasing, meaning that each person with COVID-19 is infecting more than 1 other person and contributing to a rapid spread of the virus that could overwhelm our hospital system as it has in other parts of the state and country.
""If our current surge continues, San Francisco hospitals could be overwhelmed in a few months, with 10 times as many cases as we saw in the April surge,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We crushed that curve, and we can do it again if we redouble our commitment to the safety measures we know work: staying home whenever possible, staying physically distant whenever we go out, consistently wearing face coverings and frequently washing our hands. Let's take care of each other and our City so we can be healthy and begin to reopen again.""
San Francisco is currently exceeding the testing goal of 1,800 tests per day, with 2,950 average tests per day and a total of 192,788 tests conducted to date. To reduce the delays that some San Franciscans are experiencing in testing appointments and in receiving results, City leaders are encouraging private health care providers to expand their testing services.
""The health of our communities, small businesses and workers depends on us wearing masks, getting tested, and staying home, not socializing outside our households,"" said Joaquin Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""It's clear the race against this virus will be a long one. Only by recommitting ourselves to what we know works will we slow the spread so we can continue reopening the economy for the benefit of all San Franciscans.""
San Franciscans can use the same public health principles that are informing the City's reopening plans to help guide individual choices. When you think about risk of exposure and transmission, keep these things in mind.
How risky is the activity? Five questions to ask:
1. Is the activity indoors or outdoors? Outdoors is much safer.
2. Does it involve gathering with people outside your household? That is riskier and should be avoided.
3. Can you wear face coverings at all times?
4. Can you maintain at least six feet of physical distancing?
5. Can you easily wash your hands, and is the environment properly cleaned?
Think about any activity in terms of these four characteristics:
1. Number – As the number of people or sites increases, the possible interactions increase exponentially.
2. Frequency – The more often people interact, the higher the risk of virus transmission.
3. Duration – The longer people are together, the higher the risk of virus transmission.
4. Distance – The closer together people are, the higher the risk of virus transmission.

July 14, 2020
The $487.5 million Bond for the November 2020 ballot will fund essential City infrastructure and support San Franciscan's mental and physical health with new investments in parks, open spaces, behavioral health facilities, and housing and shelter for the vulnerable
San Francisco, CA — The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to support the Health and Recovery General Obligation Bond for the November 2020 ballot. Mayor London N. Breed introduced the Bond in May to fund priority investments in mental health and homelessness, parks and recreation spaces, and essential public infrastructure.
""The Health and Recovery Bond comes at a critical time for our city. We are still in the midst of a public health emergency and we're seeing record rates of unemployment as a result. We need to invest in the health and economic wellbeing our entire community,"" said Mayor Breed. ""COVID-19 has shown us just how important it is to have safe and accessible outdoor spaces and recreation opportunities, and has underscored the need to create more permanent supportive housing, while improving our behavioral health resources.""
The Health and Recovery Bond is the result of a collaborative effort, and reflects input from multiple City departments, the Board of Supervisors, and community members. If approved by voters with a 2/3 vote in November 2020, the Bond will provide $487.5 million for three main categories of investment: health and homelessness; parks and open spaces; and right-of-way repair, including street resurfacing, curb ramps, and street structures and plazas, all with the goal of supporting economic recovery and the health of those experiencing homelessness and struggling with substance use and mental health disorders.
In November 2019, Mayor Breed asked the City Administrator to reprioritize the General Obligation Bond program to reflect and address the urgency of San Francisco's mental health and homelessness crisis. More recently, with the rise of the COVID-19 and associated increase in unemployment, there is also an urgent need to invest in shovel-ready projects and programs which can put San Franciscans back to work and stimulate our economy. It is estimated that for every $1 million spent on construction, an estimated 5.93 jobs are created.
Health and Homelessness
An estimated $207 million from the Health and Recovery Bond will fund investments in public facilities that provide housing and/or treatment to people struggling with homelessness and mental health and substance use disorders. Specifically, the Bond will provide funding for Permanent Supportive Housing, transitional housing and shelter, and mental health and substance use disorder facilities
Parks and Open Spaces
Approximately $239 million of the Bond will be dedicated to neighborhood parks projects and a variety of programs that support recreation and open spaces. The funding will improve several of the City's parks and recreation centers, playgrounds, and open spaces. The Bond includes funding for citywide parks and investments in priority recovery parks, which are City parks that will increase residents' quality of life and provide places to relax, enjoy nature, play, and exercise. Additionally, the Bond will allow the City make investments in sustainability programs, the Community Opportunity Fund, community gardens, and trails.
Right-of-Way Repair
An estimated $41.5 million will go toward right-of-way repair, including street resurfacing, curb ramps, and street structures and plazas. These improvements will make it safer and more accessible for people to move around the city. This includes $31.5 million for investing in street resurfacing; $5 million for the design, construction and maintenance of ADA-compliant accessible curb ramps; and $5 million for the repair and maintenance of street structures.
""Recovery takes on a new meaning for all of us. Not only do we need to recover from the economic downturn, but we need to heal the collective trauma felt by communities devastatingly impacted by the health crisis, isolation, and ongoing uncertainty,"" said President Norman Yee. ""This Bond is about San Franciscans' overall health. It will support jobs, expand mental health services, and revitalize our treasured open spaces and playgrounds, which have become critical to our well-being during Shelter-in-Place, especially for children and families.""
""This November, San Francisco voters have the opportunity to secure a major investment in our City's recovery and the wellbeing of our communities,"" said Supervisor and Budget Chair Sandra Lee Fewer. ""This bond also delivers resources to our parks and public spaces, funding much needed repairs, renovations and fulfilling commitments to the San Francisco community. This is a difficult time for so many, but also an opportune time to pass a bond that invests so deeply in San Francisco's health and recovery.""
""For San Francisco to reopen everyday life, including schools and businesses, we have to be able to contain the contagion and prevent ongoing spikes,"" said Supervisor Hillary Ronen. ""Now, more than ever, it is essential that we have safe housing options for vulnerable people on our streets, address major gaps in mental and behavioral healthcare, and expand access to parks and urban agriculture opportunities. This bond is an essential piece of our recovery, and I hope that the voters will join me to enthusiastically support it in November.""
""The Health and Recovery Bond meets critical needs like parks and healthcare identified in San Francisco's Ten-Year Capital Plan,"" said City Administrator Naomi M. Kelly. ""In these tough times, it is critical to build a resilient and vibrant future for San Francisco and create high paying construction jobs while ensuring that that property tax rates will not increase.""
""Safe, healthy public spaces are essential to our mental and physical health, as well as our city's recovery,"" said San Francisco Recreation and Park Department General Manager Phil Ginsburg. ""The park projects invest in the wellbeing of our communities, particularly those hit hardest by the pandemic and its economic impact. It is an investment that will pay dividends for generations.""
""People experiencing homelessness, substance use disorder and mental illness are among the most vulnerable in our City. We are fortunate that so many San Francisco leaders and residents care about improving the circumstances, housing support and systems of care for people struggling with these difficult issues,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""We know that wellness and recovery are possible, but it takes smart investment, a commitment to improvement and a recognition that housing and treatment cannot be decoupled. I am grateful to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors for including these important services in the upcoming bond.""
""By investing in shovel-ready public infrastructure projects, this bond will help rebuild San Francisco's economy while addressing capital needs in the public right of way and public spaces,"" said Acting Public Works Director Alaric Degrafinried. ""If passed by voters in November, this bond measure will help make our outdoor spaces safer and more accessible.""
The Health and Recovery General Obligation Bond is in line with the most recently updated 10-year Capital Plan. Property taxes levied for general obligation bonds including this bond, if approved by the voters and issued by the Mayor and Board of Supervisors, are expected to be maintained at or below the Fiscal Year 2006 rate.

July 13, 2020
San Francisco, CA – The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today ruled that San Francisco's sanctuary ordinance is lawful and concluded that the Trump administration's attempt to deny federal funding to the City is unconstitutional.
""Here in San Francisco, we will always demonstrate our values of diversity and inclusiveness by being a sanctuary city that stands up for all our residents and neighbors. The court ruling today further validates what we already knew—the Trump administration's attempt to overreach and bully San Francisco into abandoning our values and complying with unfair, unjust immigration enforcement laws is unconstitutional.
The Trump administration's continued attacks on immigrants are putting people's lives at risk, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We need people to be comfortable getting a COVID-19 test, going to the doctor, or responding to a contact tracer, without fearing that their information will be shared for purposes of immigration enforcement. We need all our residents to trust City government and know that we are here to help. In San Francisco, we're working to build that trust, not tear it apart with threats of deportation and enforcement actions.
Our sanctuary ordinance makes our entire city safer. Our residents should not live in fear of calling the police to report crimes or working with law enforcement to strengthen our communities. This is an important victory for San Francisco and our immigrant communities, and I want to thank City Attorney Dennis Herrera for his work on this monumental case.""

Dr. Fatteh owned and operated San Francisco Pain Management and Physical Therapy, which operated under the name Total Health Plus, a clinic that provided physical and occupational therapy and chiropractor services.
""Patients are entitled to receive care from licensed providers. When Medicare pays for patient services, it expects that the treating providers are properly licensed as required by the State.

July 10, 2020
Starting July 13th, San Francisco Zoo and Gardens can reopen with a safety plan, shoppers can use reusable shopping bags, and City will provide clarification for safe boating and fishing practices. Additional reopening dependent on improvement of COVID-19 impact on City
San Francisco, CA – Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced that the City will substantially continue the pause on reopening that began June 29 until the COVID-19 Key Health Indicators improve and the spread of the virus is brought under control once again. San Francisco is currently experiencing a rise in COVID-19 transmission, cases, and hospitalizations that is forcing the City to slow down reopening to protect community health.
On July 13th, the San Francisco Zoo and Gardens will be allowed to reopen with approved safety plans, shoppers will be able to resume using reusable bags, and boat and fishing expeditions will have additional guidelines for how to do those activities safely, with up to 12 people.
Personal services such as haircuts, massages, tattoos and body piercing, manicures and pedicures, will be the next groups of businesses considered for reopening, but only those services where both clients and providers can be masked at all times. The Department of Public Health will continue to monitor the Key Health Indicators for trends and will provide an update on July 15 on the health indicators and other information that will inform the status of further reopening.
The remaining activities and businesses that were previously scheduled to reopen either June 29 or July 13, will remain on pause. These include indoor dining, outdoor bars without food, indoor museums and aquariums, outdoor swimming pools, and real estate open houses by appointment.
Businesses and activities that are currently allowed may continue operating at this time. The City continues to encourage San Franciscans to avoid gatherings and wear face coverings when leaving home, and to get tested for COVID-19.
""COVID-19 is still too prevalent in our community, and we need to be vigilant and take all the precautions that are proven to slow the spread,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Unfortunately, reopening businesses that will encourage gathering and interacting with people outside of your own household is not the safe thing to do right now. I know people want to continue reopening, but in order for that to happen we need to once again flatten the curve so that we're able to do so.""
As of this morning, San Francisco had recorded 4,316 cases of COVID-19 and 50 deaths. One of the key indicators of COVID-19 prevalence in the City, the number of new cases per day per 100,000 people, had risen to 7.4, well above the goal of 1.8 and a sharp rise since we began reopening on May 18, when it was 3.5. The rate of increase in hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients, which does not include transfers from other counties, is also a key indicator that affects the pace of reopening. Our goal is to keep that rate below 10%, and today's indicator shows an increase of 22%. Our hospital capacity, which includes the percentage of acute care and ICU beds that are available, is currently within the acceptable range at 34% for acute care beds and 28% for ICU, but could be quickly filled in a surge of COVID-19 cases.
Modeling indicates that the reproductive rate of the virus is above 1 and increasing, meaning that each person with COVID-19 is infecting more than 1 other person and contributing to a rapid spread of the virus that could overwhelm our hospital system, as it has in other parts of the state and country. San Francisco is currently exceeding the testing goal of 1,800 tests per day, with 2,584 average tests per day and a total of 174,365 tests conducted to date.
""We are committed to continue to make decisions based on the data, science, and facts about San Francisco and the Bay Area region,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""Together, we can all improve the picture and speed up the pace of reopening by wearing face coverings, keeping your distance from others, washing your hands, and getting tested. San Franciscans know what to do, we flattened the curve before and I am hopeful that we can beat back the current surge if we all do our part.""
The Department of Public Health will monitor the Health Indicators, the risk of specific activities, the estimated reproductive rate of the virus, the regional data and the state's actions in determining when and how to move forward, pause, or dial back reopening. If the spread continues at the rate it is going now, it is probable that our City's hospitals could be overwhelmed with cases and many people could die. However, that is not inevitable, and every San Francisco resident can contribute to preventing that outcome by following the precautions and staying home as much as possible.
""Reopening the economy while in the middle of an active global pandemic was never going to be easy,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, co-chair of the City's Economic Recovery Task Force. ""But each of us doing our part to stay distanced and wear a mask, combined with the City's approach of anchoring reopening decisions based on real-time on-the-ground health indicators will help us navigate a way forward.""
""San Franciscans have stepped up and beaten this virus back before, so there's reason for hope,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Now we all need to dig deep and do it again, for the sake of our City and for our small businesses and workers who are anxious to get back to business. They're there for us, so let's be there for them now by doing everything we can to stop the spread today and get them back open quickly and safely.""
San Franciscans can use the same public health principles that are informing the City's reopening plans to help guide individual choices. When you think about risk of exposure and transmission, keep these things in mind:
Think about any activity in terms of these four characteristics:
The Health Directives outlining the requirements for zoos, boats and bags will be posted here by Monday, July 13. More information about the reopening timeline can be found at https://sf.gov/step-by-step/reopening-san-francisco.

July 09, 2020
Testing site will operate on Thursdays from 10:00am – 3:00pm in coordination with services provided at the Latino Task Force Resource Hub. Right to Recover program is part of wraparound services provided by the City and community partners.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the launch of a new mobile COVID-19 testing site at the Latino Task Force (LTF) Resource Hub in the Mission. The LTF Resource Hub connects residents with wraparound services, including the new Right to Recover program. Co-locating this testing site with existing resources provides a low-barrier, accessible testing site the Latino community and members of the Mission community who are regularly visiting the LTF Resource Hub for other services. The City's Right to Recover program encourages residents to get tested for COVID-19 while offering a safety net for people that face financial hardship if they need to isolate following a positive test result.
""Testing and contact tracing are an essential part of our City's ongoing response to COVID-19. Many of the people who are leaving their homes to go to work and keep our city running during this global pandemic are lower-wage workers who can't afford to miss a paycheck, and sadly, this virus has further heightened the disparities that already existed in our city,"" said Mayor Breed. ""When someone tests positive for COVID-19, we want them to be able to focus on getting the care they need and taking the necessary steps to slow the spread of the virus, without having to worry about how they'll pay their bills. Everyone should have the right to prioritize their health.""
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected communities of color in San Francisco, California, and across the United States. In San Francisco, Latinos make up 50% of reported cases of COVID-19 even though Latinos make up just 15% of the city's population. Many Latino, immigrant, African American, Asian, and low-income communities in San Francisco are further disadvantaged by the fact that they do not qualify for the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, unemployment insurance, or loan programs because of their immigration status. Prior to the global outbreak of COVID-19, rates of chronic illness, poor housing conditions, and low wages were already concentrated in these groups and the virus has disproportionately impacted these communities as well.
""The science is clear, and the facts are straight. In order to reduce the spread of infection, essential workers must get tested at a higher rate, they also need to know that if they volunteer to be tested, and test positive, that they will be able to safely quarantine for their own protection and the health of the public at large,"" said Supervisor Hillary Ronen. ""This new site at the Latino Taskforce Resource Hub will give essential workers an easy and culturally competent access to testing and all the services available to them, including Right to Recover. I want to thank Latino Taskforce for their advocacy and DPH and the Mayor's Office for responding to this need and making this test site happen. The Mission Community deserves this critical first step to help identify positive cases, help them recover and make our neighborhood healthy again.""
""Thank you to the Mission Hub for continuing to be a vital resource for the Latinx Community in the historic Mission Language Vocational School,"" said Supervisor Ahsha Safaí. ""Not only can families access groceries, but now they can get free testing and resources to safely quarantine. Thank you to the Latino Task Force and all the volunteers who make this great work possible.""
Testing Site
There are currently four other testing sites in the Mission, including Castro Mission Health Center and Mission Neighborhood Health Center. By linking testing with existing resources and trusted community partners, this new mobile site further expands the City's testing outreach and education to the Mission community. The Mission currently has a high rate of positive cases among those who have been tested, with 107.6 positive cases per 10,000 residents. To date, there are 642 positive cases among an estimated 59,639 residents in the Mission neighborhood.
The new mobile testing site is the latest resource expansion at the LTF Resource Hub, and will provide free walk-thru testing on Thursdays. Testing is available for anyone who is leaving home to work, thinks they may have been exposed, or is experiencing at least one symptom on COVID-19. Insurance and identification are not required. The site began operating today and will operate on Thursdays from 10:00am to 3:00pm. People with appointments and drop-ins will be checked in by LTF Resource Hub staff and escorted to the testing tent designated for specimen collection.
DPH will administer the tests, providing tests results by phone, and conducting contact tracing and offering social services if test results are positive. Contact tracing is an essential component of follow up for positive test results, and participants will be informed about the importance of working with contact tracers to slow the spread of the virus.
DPH and the Latino Task Force will work together to provide a comprehensive and culturally integrated community-based approach which will include a Community Wellness Team composed of bilingual, Spanish-speaking community workers.
""We listened to community and responded when identifying the next location for mobile testing in San Francisco,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""Our partnership with the Latino Task Force recognizes the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on the Latinx community and that equity must be front and center in our guiding our efforts. The addition of mobile testing to the Resource Hub will offer low-barrier testing to community residents in a safe and supportive environment with wraparound services.""
""Contact tracing is completely voluntary and all the information we collect from the individual will be protected and confidential,"" said Dr. Tomás Aragón, San Francisco Health Officer. ""The phone call we make to you is about building trust. It's about explaining what we are doing with the information you help provide to us and why we are asking for it. We are public health and we are here to connect you to wraparound services that will minimize disruptions and ensure your safety and health.""
Latino Task Force Resource Hub
The LTF Resource Hub has been operating over the past few months and provides food distribution and other services. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the center distributes food, and serves approximately 6,000 families per week. On Wednesday and Thursdays from 10:00am to 4:00pm, the LTF Resource Hub provides services including:

Right to Recover Program
The City's $2 million ""Right to Recover"" program works hand-in-hand with COVID-19 testing sites across the City. It provides those who qualify with a wage replacement while they recover. Based on San Francisco minimum wage, a two-week wage replacement amounts to $1,285. The program's financial support will serve up to 1,500 San Franciscans who test positive for COVID-19 to focus on their health and recovery regardless of their immigration status.
The purpose of Right to Recover and the City's other relief programs, including the Family Relief Fund and the Immigrant Workers Fund program, is to fill the gaps of federal funding by putting money in the hands of the people that need it the most. The goal is to encourage residents and workers to get tested for COVID-19 and not worry about economic hardship during isolation. The programs aim to remove barriers to allow access to relief for those who may not trust government programs due to their immigration status and experience in the criminal justice system.
Under the Right to Recover program, when a person tests positive for COVID-19, the Department of Public Health (DPH) conducts an interview with that person. During the interview, DPH will ask if they have access to replacement wages while they isolate. If not, they will connect the individual to the Right to Recover program. The City will not ask or record any questions about citizenship or immigration status. In addition to this relief program, DPH will also share other wraparound services to support residents around food security, housing assistance, and workforce services.
The Right to Recover program is designed to ensure that those who qualify also receive a comprehensive and culturally competent assessment of their ability to isolate and properly self-care by community partners. This program is made possible by community partners including the Mission Economic Development Agency (MEDA), Young Community Developers (YCD), Central City Hospitality House, and Self-Help for the Elderly in collaboration with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), DPH, and the Human Rights Commission.
""We need workers to feel secure in getting tested, without concern for how they are going to make rent or put food on the table if they test positive. The Right to Recover program ensures that workers who live in San Francisco and struggle to make ends meet have a safety net to make the very best health decisions,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""By increasing access to testing, we're proactively promoting the health of workers and our City's recovery.""
""The virus has impacted the Mission community and we are at Ground ZERO. We have to protect our families because you may have coronavirus and not know it. Expanding testing in our community is urgent to ensure the safety and wellness of the Latino population in San Francisco,"" said Roberto Hernandez, Latino Task Force Co-Founder. ""We are proud to launch this new mobile testing site here at the Latino Task Force Resource Hub. From weekly food distribution and home deliveries, supporting individuals who need healthcare or help signing up for Medi-Cal, to assisting with filing for unemployment or finding a job, we strive to continue offering vital services that serve the essential needs of each person and our families.""
""As an organization we are elated to work alongside community partners regarding all San Franciscans Right to Recover,"" said Dion-Jay Brookter, Executive Director of Young Community Developers, Inc. (YCD). ""We have already been engaging, strategizing and meeting with one another on how to address the challenges of our community residents most in need through this initiative.""
""As proven by April's in-depth UCSF public health study, there is a high concentration of positive tests for COVID-19 in the Mission's Latino community, as our families are more likely to be essential workers in the food industry, at construction sites and the like,"" said Luis Granados, CEO, MEDA. ""Additionally, our families live in overcrowded conditions, making social distancing a challenge. The Right to Recover program will allow some of these Latino essential workers to quarantine as needed, without fear of income loss: This is an essential first step to eradicating the virus not just in the Mission, but in San Francisco overall. MEDA looks forward to working with the City and philanthropy on other innovative programs to address the systemic, long-term obstacles faced by our Latino community around housing, food, health care and jobs.""
The City's relief programs are made possible from the Give2SF COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. In March, Mayor Breed announced three priority areas for the Give2SF Fund: food security, access to housing, and support for workers and small businesses, with a focus on assisting undocumented people and mixed-status households who otherwise may not have access to social safety net programs; seniors and people with disabilities; and small businesses. To donate to Give2SF, go to www.Give2SF.org.

As the City pivots from COVID-19 response to recovery, the City partners with non-profits to fund and operate a bold initiative to ensure that hundreds of unhoused residents never return to homelessness
San Francisco, CA — Today, Mayor London N. Breed and the All In Campaign, powered by Tipping Point Community, announced that 200 unhoused San Franciscans who have been temporarily placed in hotels under the City's emergency response to COVID-19 would move into long-term homes by the end of the year through a Flexible Housing Subsidy Pool.
""Even as we have implemented emergency responses to COVID-19, we have remained focused on long term solutions to homelessness, particularly more housing,"" said Mayor Breed. ""The Flexible Housing Subsidy Pool is an innovative and cost-effective way to get our unhoused residents out of temporary shelters, off the streets, and into permanent homes.""
The ""Flex Pool,"" as it is commonly known, is a housing strategy that matches people experiencing homelessness to vacant private market apartments across the city, and provides supportive services so that they remain stably housed. This model has proven effective, helping over 8,000 people transition from homelessness to permanent homes with supportive services in Los Angeles since 2014. San Francisco has already started utilizing the Flex Pool on a small scale and will significantly build on these efforts over the course of the year.
The San Francisco Flex Pool is a partnership between the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), Brilliant Corners, and philanthropy including Tipping Point Community, Dignity Health, and Crankstart. HSH will refer eligible individuals into the Flex Pool. Brilliant Corners will identify landlords and property owners who have vacant units available, support prospective tenants through the leasing process, and provide housing retention services to tenants throughout the duration of their lease. Tenants will contribute 30% of their income towards their rent, while receiving rental subsidies and supportive services that help them stay housed for the long term. Philanthropic dollars will pay for the first 18 months of Flex Pool operations.
""We are committed to securing permanent homes for as many of the people who have been sheltered as a result of COVID-19 as we possibly can. The Flex Pool is an important step in fulfilling that commitment,"" said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, Interim Director of the Department of Homeless and Supportive Housing.
""The combination of supportive services and rent subsidies is a sustainable formula for securing the housing people need to be healthy,"" said Ashley Brand, system director of community and homeless health for CommonSpirit Health and Dignity Health. ""As a health system, we have a mission to improve health, especially for people who are vulnerable, and we're grateful for partnerships like this that help those struggling to find a safe place to live.""
Data shows that homelessness and COVID-19 both disproportionately impact the Black community. As the City lifts shelter-in-place restrictions, this program will ensure that hundreds of our most vulnerable unhoused residents, many of whom are Black and at greater risk for contracting COVID-19, secure permanent homes where they can better protect their health. The partners are committed to ensuring that the Flex Pool plays a role in reducing the racial disparities among San Francisco's homeless population.
""To truly demonstrate our commitment to racial equality, we must make good on our promise to secure housing for the many Black people who have been disproportionately impacted by homelessness for years, even decades,"" said Chris Block, Tipping Point's Chronic Homelessness Initiative Director.
Given the current rental market, it is less expensive to lease apartments in many neighborhoods than it is to pay nightly hotel rates. By moving people out of hotels, the program will free up more space for people who are currently on our streets to access hotel rooms, while expanding the supply of supportive housing throughout San Francisco.
""Flexible housing subsidy pools are the most efficient model for matching people to existing housing resources. While it can take three to five years to build a new 50-unit affordable building, a Flex Pool can house 200 people or more in a matter of months – and help them to stay housed,"" said William F. Pickel, CEO of Brilliant Corners.
The City has already moved some people into permanent housing through the Flex Pool, including Roland Limjoco, 47, who had been homeless for several years and moved into his new studio in early June.
""I feel less stressed now... I was so stressed every day. It was hard being homeless. I remember the times I was staying on the street, and I had a really bad experience. I was so excited when I moved in. Here in my new place it is great, quiet, and I have a nice view. I never had this before. I also now have an elevator which is great due to my knee problems,"" said Limjoco.
About All In
The All In campaign is a diverse coalition focused on solutions to homelessness in San Francisco. The campaign's first call to action is to secure homes for 1,100 people experiencing homelessness throughout San Francisco's 11 supervisorial districts. Solving homelessness is a shared responsibility that requires involvement from the entire City. As one of the wealthiest and most innovative cities in the world, we have the resources and ingenuity to address homelessness boldly and compassionately. Now is the moment to go all in. https://www.sfallin.org/

Businesses currently allowed to be open can continue operating, including outdoor dining and indoor retail; indoor dining and outdoor bars will not move forward on July 13; other business activities slated for Phase 2C are being evaluated
San Francisco, CA – Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax announced today that the City will temporarily delay allowing indoor dining and outdoor bars to reopen on July 13, due to a rise in COVID-19 transmission, cases and hospitalizations in San Francisco.
The City is currently evaluating other businesses that had been proposed to reopen between June 29 and July 13, including hair salons, barber shops, indoor museums, outdoor pools, gyms, real estate open houses by appointment, and zoos, as part of the Phase 2C reopening. An update on the status of reopening these businesses will be provided by the end of the week. Businesses and activities that are currently allowed may continue operating at this time. The City continues to encourage San Franciscans to avoid gatherings and wear face coverings when leaving home, and to get tested for COVID-19.
""We know the pause on reopening is disappointing, but it is in the best interest of public health,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We'll continue to make decisions based on the data and the situation in our city, and in the meantime, we all need to do our part to keep each other safe and healthy. That means wearing face coverings, keeping your distance from others, and getting tested. We know that is what is needed in order to get us to a place where we can safely resume reopening.""
As of this morning, San Francisco had recorded 4,020 cases of COVID-19, and 50 deaths. One of the key indicators of COVID-19 prevalence in the city, the number of new cases per day per 100,000 people, had risen to 6.1, well above the goal of 1.8 and a sharp rise since we began reopening on May 18, when it was 3.5. The rate of increase in hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients is also a key indicator that affects the pace of reopening. Our goal is to keep that rate below 10%, and today's indicator shows an increase of 25%. Our hospital capacity, which includes the percentage of acute care and ICU beds that are available, is currently within acceptable range at 35% for acute care beds and 30% for ICU, but could be quickly filled in a surge of COVID-19 cases. Modeling indicates that the reproductive rate of the virus is climbing above 1, meaning that each person with COVID-19 is infecting more than 1 other person and contributing to a rapid spread of the virus that could overwhelm our hospital system, as it has in other parts of the state and country.
""When we examine the health indicators, the regional picture, and what we are learning about the reproductive rate of COVID-19 in our community, we are forced to conclude that it would not be responsible to move forward with indoor dining or outdoor bars on Monday,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We understand the importance of planning for businesses, and the urgent need that all residents have to get back to work and the new normal. However, the virus has no timeline and spreads quickly when people gather, and we must do everything we can to slow the spread. We also know that safely reopening San Francisco, with a healthy population and a renewed economy, is still possible as long as we all do our part.""
The gradual reopening of local businesses has been on pause since June 26 and will resume when the data indicate that conditions have improved.
""Even though a pause in reopening is disappointing, the resurgence we see in cases and hospitalizations reminds us of why it's important not to lose sight that we are in the middle of an active global pandemic and why it's critical that we approach reopening in a measured way driven by facts on the ground,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, co-chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""We must continue to do everything we can to support our local economy and small businesses while protecting the health of workers and the public — as individuals, this means keeping safe distances and wearing face coverings.""
""To support the safe reopening of our economy, and for the benefit of workers and small businesses, it is vital we take countermeasures anytime we see the virus reasserting itself in our community,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Every single day counts now, and it's up to all of us to protect San Francisco's safety and economy. If we take simple, personal precautions – wear a face covering, wash our hands frequently and keep socially distant – we can quickly, collectively slow the spread, and get back to the important business of reopening.""
More than 20 California counties have been placed on a state ""watch list"" and some have already had to roll back their reopening. San Francisco is not currently on that list, but several other Bay Area counties are, and because we are part of an interdependent region, our situation is linked together with theirs. San Francisco could join the list if we do not slow the spread of the virus and see a decrease in new cases and hospitalizations. While many San Franciscans avoided gatherings and wore face coverings over the Fourth of July holiday, we may see an increase in cases in the next two to three weeks linked to those who did not follow these safe practices. Everyone's behavior matters now if we want to slow the spread of the virus and continue reopening.

July 06, 2020
San Francisco, CA – ""There are no words that will ease the pain of the senseless killing of a six-year-old boy. Our prayers are with the family of Jace Young at this moment, along with his friends and his entire community.
But make no mistake: thoughts and prayers are not enough.
We must do more. The surging Black Lives Matter Movement is about ending police violence, but it's also about more than that. It's about investing in our Black children's lives and ending the gun violence that continues from generation to generation, because a boy like Jace Young should have been able to grow up safely in his own community. We must hold ourselves accountable and end this viscous cycle. We must talk to our children, talk to our extended families, talk to our loved ones, talk about the cruel death of a six-year-old boy. We must address the systemic factors that continue to perpetuate this senseless loss of life.
Because the loss of any life is tragic, but losing a six-year-old child to gun violence rips at the heart of our city. Jace Young was at the very beginning of his life. A resident of Huntersview, he was a bright light in the neighborhood. He was a little boy who should have been given the opportunity to go to school, play with his friends, and lead a life that would make his family proud. Instead, he was brutally gunned down on the Fourth of July. This Black child's life mattered!
Growing up in San Francisco, we both saw too many people killed by gun violence. We saw the anger, despair and hopelessness that swallowed our communities in the wake of this irreparable damage. We saw mothers weeping and fathers broken. We both dedicated our lives to changing the circumstances that systematically put Black people in harm's way. Clearly, we must do more.
When we talk about supporting the African-American community, we have to remember the young people like Jace who have the right to live their lives in peace. Black kids deserve the opportunities to grow up and thrive just like every other kid. But as long as the weapons and the violence – and the complacency – continue to disproportionately bear down on the Black community, those opportunities will too often drown in our own blood.
We have to take a closer look at how we are investing in our communities so that we are actually making a difference in the lives of Black people. It's not just about marching. It's about doing the hard work after the march, engaging practically and constructively to lift people up out of the cycle of poverty and violence that has ripped us apart for far too long.
This cannot be business as usual. We must put down the guns – everyone must put down the guns – and turn our sights on the long, hard work ahead. We must change the conditions and the institutions that have failed the Black community. And that starts with us. We must be the change.""

Cohen, member of the California State Board of Equalization, would bring experience advocating for social justice and police reform to the Commission
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced that she is nominating Malia M. Cohen to serve on the Police Commission, the seven-member body charged with setting policy for the Police Department and conducting disciplinary hearings when police conduct charges are filed.
""I am proud to nominate Malia M. Cohen to the Police Commission. The recent high-profile killings of Black Americans by police officers has focused the nation's attention on the urgent need to rethink the role that police play in our communities, and this is an issue that Malia has been a leader on her whole career,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Whether it was fighting to create the Department of Police Accountability or pushing to end the use of chokeholds by the Police Department, Malia has consistently advocated for, and won, significant reforms to policing in San Francisco in order to keep people safe. I'm confident that she'll continue to move this issue forward on the Police Commission.""
""It is an honor to partner with Mayor Breed and our communities to rethink and improve the delivery of law enforcement services in San Francisco,"" said Malia Cohen. ""I look forward to joining with our Board of Supervisors, SFPD Chief William Scott, the men and women of his Department, and all who have fought to bring about decent and reformed law enforcement that puts the lives and well-being of all San Franciscans first. My hope is that all who come into contact with the SFPD, particularly African Americans and persons of color, will be treated with respect, and that the Mayor's reforms will build bridges and become a model for our country during these troubled times.""
Cohen served as the Chair of the California State Board of Equalization (BOE) in 2019, and she is the first African-American woman to serve on the Board. As a member of the BOE, Cohen represents nearly 10 million constituents in Northern and Central California. Prior to serving on the BOE, she was President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, where she represented District 10 for eight years and was Chair of the Budget and Finance Committee.
Throughout her life, Cohen has fought for diversity and inclusion. As a member of the Board of Supervisors, Cohen was instrumental in banning the use of chokeholds by the San Francisco Police Department. In 2016, she led the effort to create the independent Department of Police Accountability, with expanded powers to audit the police department and investigate all police shootings. In addition to her leadership on police reform, Cohen has championed policies and programs that protect public health, foster economic development, promote new affordable housing, and that create good jobs.
Cohen was born and raised in San Francisco. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee, and a Masters in Science in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She resides in the Bayview neighborhood with her husband, attorney Warren Pulley.
Earlier this month, Mayor Breed announced a roadmap to fundamentally change the nature of policing in San Francisco and issued a set of policies to address structural inequities. She proposed four priorities to achieve this vision: ending the use of police in response to non-criminal activity; addressing police bias and strengthening accountability; demilitarizing the police; and promoting economic justice. These policies build on the City's ongoing work to meet the standards contained in President Obama's 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing.

New pop-up testing site to provide free, low barrier COVID-19 testing to Tenderloin residents
San Francisco, CA – The San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH) and GLIDE today announced the establishment of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Testing Site at GLIDE, a new free COVID-19 testing site in GLIDE's parking lot adjacent to the entrance at 330 Ellis Street. In an effort to ensure accessible COVID-19 testing for vulnerable communities in the Tenderloin neighborhood, the new pop-up testing site will begin offering walk-through COVID-19 testing on Tuesday, July 7.
The Tenderloin Neighborhood Testing Site at GLIDE will serve some of the City's most vulnerable populations, including unhoused and underserved residents. By collaborating with community-based organizations that directly serve the neighborhood residents, this site expands the City's testing outreach and education to the Tenderloin community. The Tenderloin currently has a high rate of positive cases among those who have been tested, with 106.1 positive cases per 10,000 residents. To date, there are 314 positive cases among an estimated 29,588 residents of the neighborhood.
""As we adapt to living with COVID-19 until we have a vaccine, testing continues to be a critical part of our citywide response and will help us slow the spread of the virus in our community,"" said Mayor London N. Breed. ""Thanks to GLIDE and the Department of Public Health, this new site in the heart of the Tenderloin will make it easier for people to get tested if they are leaving home to go to work or are feeling sick, while also connecting people to resources like food, hygiene kits, and other social services.""
""The Tenderloin has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and establishing this permanent testing site in partnership with community organizations is a critical step in protecting the health of the neighborhood,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney.
Last week, the testing site held a pilot to ensure smooth operations before tomorrow's official launch, effectively testing 26 people. This accomplishment builds on the success of the City's first mobile testing site, launched in the Tenderloin on May 20, in which the City partnered with Verily, GLIDE, Code Tenderloin, and other community partners over nine days to test more than 1,600 of the neighborhood's most vulnerable residents.
""We are excited to bring another testing site into the Tenderloin that offers free, low barrier access, and culturally competent testing services,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""This testing expansion is possible thanks to our partnership with GLIDE and other community providers to prioritize the safety of vulnerable community members. We are determined to create a familiar and welcoming presence at the testing site for everyone in the neighborhood, in addition to raising awareness about the resources and services offered on site, and the importance of contact tracing for those who test positive.""
""We are pleased to partner with the City of San Francisco to provide COVID-19 testing at GLIDE for the most marginalized in our City,"" said Karen Hanrahan, President and CEO of GLIDE. ""We will lean on our trusted relationships with community partners to make sure the homeless and hardest to reach can access testing, obtain their test results and receive the care they need. During this global pandemic, GLIDE will continue to expand our services and do whatever we can to enhance the health, dignity, and protection of the most marginalized – in the Tenderloin and throughout San Francisco.""

Testing at the site will take place on Tuesdays from 10:00AM to 4:00PM, and people can sign up in advance. GLIDE will have staff at the lobby of 330 Ellis Street, ready to register community members on Thursdays and Fridays from 10:00AM to 4:00PM, with the goal of moving toward same-day registration in the near future. Residents will be registered for testing on a Tuesday of their choice without a specific appointment time. The testing site is also working to add a second day of testing per week.
DPH will administer the tests, providing test results by phone, and conducting contact tracing and offering social services if test results are positive. For those who do not have phones, GLIDE will assist with lowering barriers by connecting the person with access to their test results and contact tracing interviews. Contact tracing is an essential component of follow up for positive test results, and participants will be informed about the importance of working with contact tracers to slow the spread of the virus.
GLIDE is a nationally recognized center for social justice dedicated to fighting systemic injustices, creating pathways out of poverty and crisis, and transforming lives. In addition to supporting the testing operation, GLIDE's integrated comprehensive services, advocacy initiatives, and inclusiveness empower individuals, families, and children to achieve stability and thrive. GLIDE is on the forefront of addressing some of the most pressing issues including poverty, housing insecurity, mental and physical health, drug use disorder, and food insecurity.
Joining this effort are trusted community partners, Code Tenderloin, Coalition on Homelessness, Tenderloin Community Benefit District and St. Anthony's that are helping raise awareness about the site and connecting people to other services. Code Tenderloin will also be handing out masks on the testing site for those who need it.

35,/us/across-america/housing-policy-s-turning-back-gentrification,2020-07-06T23:18:12Z,The Housing Policy That’s Turning Back,0,0,High Country News,News Partner,"From the High Country News:
By Nick Bowlin

In the summer of 2019, Elizabeth Bell's apartment building in San Francisco's Mission District went up for sale, and real estate agents were soon giving tours to prospective developers. As fear of eviction or rent hikes sank in, Bell, 74, started getting heart palpitations. Her apartment was cheap, rent-controlled, a necessity for Bell, who supplements Social Security with gig-translation work to make ends meet.
There's a rail stop less than two blocks away — useful, because Bell does not bicycle as easily as she used to. And she loves the place, which has a ""beautiful arch over the front door"" with cracked stained glass above the frame. The other residents are a diverse mix — longtime Latino families, one with a disabled son; low-income seniors like Bell; a young couple. All depend on rent control to live in the Mission, the historic home of San Francisco's Latino community, now riven by some of the city's most intense gentrification.
If forced to leave, Bell knew she could not afford to stay in San Francisco, where she has lived since 1975. ""I am very bonded to the city, she said in an interview. ""I don't know where I would pick up and start again at this point in my life.""
To save the building, she and other tenants contacted housing advocates, who eventually introduced them to the Mission Economic Development Agency (MEDA), a longtime Bay Area nonprofit. Over the past few years, MEDA has emerged as a leader in an anti-gentrification effort, known as a ""right-to-purchase"" policy, where local nonprofits obtain residential buildings to prevent development and displacement. The average income of residents in properties acquired by MEDA is more than 30% lower than the area's median income. Prior to the COVID-19 economic downturn, the average rent for a one-bedroom in San Francisco was $3,360 a month, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. To date, MEDA has acquired 32 buildings (more than 250 units), with two more on the way.
This and other tenant-protection policies are spreading across California. The COVID-19 downturn caused unemployment rates not seen since the Great Depression, and experts fear a housing crisis will follow. San Francisco's city council recently passed an eviction ban. Oakland and Berkeley had already introduced their own right-to-purchase polices pre-coronavirus, both of which gained urgency after the pandemic hit. Los Angeles extended eviction protections through the summer and, spurred by COVID-19, is considering its own right-to-purchase policy. And in late June, a bill was introduced in the California legislature that would create a statewide version of the policy.
MEDA bought Bell's building in February, just as COVID-19 was beginning to surge in the Bay Area. In addition to financial peace of mind, the purchase allowed Bell, whose age puts her at heightened risk for coronavirus, to remain in her home. Doctors never determined the cause of her palpitations, she said, ""but I can tell you, I do not have them anymore.""
THE ENORMOUS LOSS of wealth for, and displacement of, low-income and Black and Latino families after the 2008 financial crisis convinced MEDA staff that they needed new and better tools ""for when the next financial crisis comes,"" Johnny Oliver, an organizer for the group, said. As properties foreclosed, developers bought them and turned them into high-end condos. Oliver described MEDA's work as ""reversing gentrification in the Mission District,"" which has been transformed by years of unrestrained housing development and speculation. The Latino population in the Mission has shrunk by nearly 30% — a conservative estimate, given the challenge in counting undocumented people — over the past two decades.
Abetting this displacement is a California law called the Ellis Act. A powerful driver of gentrification, the Ellis Act allows landlords to evict entire buildings of tenants before selling a property. The new properties become condos or tenancy-in-common flats, a housing designation that allows buyers to purchase a percentage of the property. The rise of TICs in San Francisco is associated with the Silicon Valley tech boom. Cash-rich coders can buy their share of the building up front. For tenants, the Ellis Act can mean forced displacement; for landlords, it eases the process of selling a residential building.
Oliver and other housing organizers say that repealing the Ellis Act is not feasible given the powerful real estate lobby, so they set out to find their own policy tool. First came a program to publicly fund purchases of local buildings, established in 2014. But housing advocates found that many properties changed hands in back-channel deals between landlords and developers. San Francisco addressed this problem in fall 2019 with the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA), which guarantees local nonprofits like MEDA a five-day window in which to make an offer on a distressed property, before the building owner can sell. The nonprofit then has 25 days to match other bids.
Landlords and developers oppose COPA, largely due to this bureaucratic delay. Joshua Howard, executive vice president of local government affairs for the California Apartment Association, a trade group that represents 25,000 rental property owners across the state, said that more housing is the key to addressing California's housing crisis. Policies like COPA don't do this, he said, but they do ""create bureaucracy and delay."" Howard supports funding for nonprofits like MEDA, but said they should bid on properties that hit the market, just like a private entity. ""(Right-to-purchase policies) would not create new units of housing,"" he said, ""but do serve to slow down the process for a property owner to sell their rental unit.""
For Bay Area residents, the Ellis Act is so notorious that it has become a verb. Chloe Jackman-Buitrago, who was born and raised in San Francisco, said she feared being ""Ellis Act-ed"" back in late 2019. Jackman-Buitrago owns a photography studio around the corner from her building in the Inner Richmond neighborhood. When her apartment building hit the market, she looked at other rents in the area and doubted she would be able to stay in the city if she was forced out. MEDA bought the building instead, and she was able to stay.
""(MEDA) is keeping people in their homes,"" Jackman-Buitrago said. ""These are the people who keep this city running, who make this city what it is. The tech 22-year-olds come in and turn the buildings into some fucking cookie-cutter thing, and where do the people go?""
THE BUILDING-ACQUISITION program requires that all residents of a property favor the purchase. When she talked to her neighbors about supporting a MEDA purchase, however, Jackman-Buitrago ran into a strange problem: To people used to the city's typical real estate moves, it seemed too good to be true. It took some convincing, but eventually they came around. With the help of the city, MEDA will manage the building for a 99-year term. It has also promised to do work that the previous landlord neglected; in Jackman-Buitrago's apartment, for example, dirt would creep up from under the floorboards, and the wall behind the bathtub had rotted away. Jackman-Buitrago, her husband, Michael — also born in the city — and their 1-year-old son will soon move into a previously empty unit. MEDA is undertaking major repairs, including replacing the rotting boards in the old apartment and updating the kitchen in her new one.
Though it took a pandemic for tenant-protection policies to gain momentum, Oliver, the MEDA organizer, cautions that these policies are small compared to the magnitude of California's housing crisis. Keeping people in their homes is one way to alleviate the pressure, but so is building more affordable housing. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave the Bay Area over the last 20 years. Then there's the scale of the building-acquisition program, which currently involves fewer than 10 nonprofits. There are more potential properties moving toward the market than housing nonprofits can afford or manage. And because of COVID-caused budget issues, Oliver expects that San Francisco will have to reduce funding for nonprofit purchases of local real estate.
Jackman-Buitrago often feels a sense of loss; the city of her childhood is largely gone, she said, yet the area still feels like home. Bell has seen 45 years of change in the Bay Area, and she agrees. She has no desire to live anywhere else, yet development has diminished the city she remembers. ""A community doesn't just re-form,"" she said. ""It's gone.""

July 02, 2020
California Strategic Growth Council's Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities and Infill Infrastructure Grant Programs will expedite the construction of crucial affordable housing and infrastructure projects
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the City has received more than $130 million in State funding for affordable housing, transportation, and infrastructure projects. Over $80 million in funding will support three affordable housing developments and associated transportation improvements at Potrero Block B, 266 4th Street, and Balboa Park Upper Yard. These three projects are supported by the California Strategic Growth Council's Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program with funds from California Climate Investments—Cap-and-Trade Dollars at Work. Additionally, the City was granted $51.7 million in financing for the construction of crucial infrastructure at Sunnydale and Potrero HOPE SF sites, Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island, as well as work related to the BART Plaza redesign at Balboa Park.
""This $130 million in grants from the State could not have come at a more critical time as we continue to deal with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will allow us to accelerate construction on more than 350 affordable homes and undertake major infrastructure improvements,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This will help us free up financing capacity for other badly needed affordable housing developments across San Francisco and put people back to work with well-paying construction jobs.""
The grants for these projects are provided by the California Strategic Growth Council's Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program (AHSC) with funds from California Climate Investments. California Climate Investments is a statewide initiative that puts billions of Cap-and-Trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy, and improving public health and the environment, particularly in disadvantaged communities.
The AHSC funding will support three housing developments. Potrero Block B is part of the HOPE SF revitalization effort, the nation's first large-scale community development and reparations initiative aimed at creating vibrant, inclusive, mixed-income communities without mass displacement of the original residents. Of the nearly $30 million the project was awarded by AHSC, $20 million will fund the 157-unit affordable housing project developed by BRIDGE which is expected to break ground in summer 2021. An additional $6 million will fund improvements to the Third Street Transit project as well as bike and pedestrian safety upgrades on Cesar Chavez Street. $1.5 million will fund street improvements on Minnesota Street between 22nd and 25th Streets in partnership with San Francisco Public Works. Potrero Block B was also successful in securing $11.7 million of funding for crucial infrastructure work on site.
""I am thrilled that these important projects will receive state funding, and applaud our City's efforts to build affordable housing,"" said Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), Chair of the California Senate Housing Committee. ""Now more than ever, due to COVID-19 and the economic fallout, people are suffering financially. Housing insecurity and homelessness are spiking, and we need long term solutions that get people housed. This is great news in a challenging time, and I look forward to seeing these projects serve our community.""
266 4th Street will be located on a San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA)-owned site located directly above the Yerba Buena/Moscone Center SFMTA subway station, which is currently under construction. Of the approximately $20 million the project was awarded by AHSC, $13.6 million will go to fund the 70-unit affordable housing project developed by the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation with half the units designated for formerly homeless families. Additional funding will go to fund transportation projects—approximately $3.3 million will fund the purchase of new BART cars, and approximately $2.7 million will help fund the Better Market Street Project.
""I am so happy to see San Francisco receive this funding to further our affordable housing goals,"" said Assemblymember David Chiu (D-San Francisco). ""As COVID-19 continues to impact our communities, adding to our affordable housing stock and ensuring San Franciscans have access to secure housing will keep us all healthy.""
Balboa Park Upper Yard will be located on a Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD)-owned site located adjacent to the Balboa BART Station. In addition to 131-units of affordable housing, of which 39 are subsidized by San Francisco Housing Authority, the ground floor of the project boasts almost 10,000 square feet of community space, including an early childhood education center, family resource center and neighborhood-serving serving retail. Construction on the project, developed by Mission Housing and Related California, is expected to begin in spring 2021. Of the nearly $30 million the project was awarded by AHSC, $20 million will fund the affordable housing component, with an additional $3.3 million allocated to purchase three new BART cars, $5 million to construct the southern Balboa Park BART Plaza and nearly $1.2 million for Ocean Avenue bike and pedestrian safety improvements, in partnership with the SFMTA. In addition, the Balboa Park Upper Yard project successfully secured an additional $3.5 million from the State grant to fully fund the BART Plaza redevelopment.
""This is exciting news for San Francisco. These state funds enable us to address two pressing issues: affordable housing and climate change. More residents will reduce their carbon emissions by ditching their cars if they live near reliable public transit and safe bike/pedestrian routes. These projects put us on track to having more inclusive and sustainable communities in our city,"" said Assemblymember Phil Ting (D-San Francisco), Chair of the Assembly Budget Committee.
The Treasure Island Development Authority, a City agency, was awarded a $30 million State grant to widen a key segment of Hillcrest Road on Yerba Buena. The road project will dramatically improve access to the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge for current and future Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island residents and provide a dedicated eastbound lane that will serve new AC Transit bus service to and from Oakland. The project will be integrated with other roadway and ramp improvements planned or currently under construction by Treasure Island Community Development and the San Francisco County Transportation Authority to enhance transit and traffic circulation.
Sunnydale Block 3B was awarded $6.5 million for the construction of infrastructure by the state grant for the next phase of Sunnydale HOPE SF, further decreasing the City's contribution to these crucial infrastructure improvements on site. Once complete, Block 3B will be a mixed-use family residential project, developed by Mercy Housing and Related California, with ground floor community serving spaces and retail located at the intersection of Sunnydale Avenue and Hahn Street. The project will contain 92 units of affordable family housing, including 69 set aside as public housing replacement units subsidized by Project Based Section 8 Vouchers from the San Francisco Housing Authority.

June 30, 2020
Board of Supervisors today approved Mayor Breed's resolution to lease a new building at 833 Bryant Street to provide 145 permanently affordable homes
San Francisco, CA — The Board of Supervisors today approved Mayor London N. Breed's resolution to lease 833 Bryant, which will provide 145 units of Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) for people experiencing homelessness. These new units are part of the City's effort to open up over 1,000 new permanent supportive housing units by the end of 2024. PSH provides long-term affordable housing with on-site social services to people exiting chronic homelessness. Currently, over 10,800 people live in the City's PSH.
""We need to keep creating more housing in San Francisco and doing so as quickly as we can, because housing is the solution to homelessness,"" said Mayor Breed. ""These new homes will not only provide permanent housing for formerly homeless people, they will also open up more spaces in our shelter system for people who are currently living on the streets. I want to thank all our partners on this project for their work to create this new building and for working with the City to create these much-needed homes.""
""This project not only provides much needed permanent supportive housing, but also takes an innovative approach in reducing time and costs,"" said Abigail Stewart- Kahn, Interim Director of the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. ""The 833 Bryant Street public private partnership demonstrates that supportive housing can be developed rapidly and effectively to serve chronically homeless people in our community.""
833 Bryant, previously a surface parking lot in SoMa, is currently under construction. When complete in fall 2021, it will provide 145 permanently affordable homes with in-unit kitchens and bathrooms. The resolution would allow the City to lease the building to provide ongoing housing to households exiting homelessness.
The master lease resolution that Mayor Breed introduced and that was approved today is competitive relative to other City PSH master lease projects with fewer amenities. At the end of the lease term, the City will have the option to purchase the land for $1, and the building will be permanently affordable.
833 Bryant represents a new approach to financing 100% affordable housing in San Francisco. No City funds are used to construct the project. Instead, the Housing Accelerator Fund (HAF) invested $35 million of a larger philanthropic donation from Tipping Point Community to acquire the surface parking lot, fund project design, entitlements, and start construction, now well underway. The project developer, Mercy Housing California, is securing low-income housing tax credits and tax-exempt bonds in partnership with Citibank and the State of California to finish construction, which will return a portion of the philanthropic funds to the HAF to invest in additional supportive housing projects. The City's agreement to enter into a long-term lease, which will support debt service on the project's permanent loan, allows for the tax-exempt bond rating to be linked to the City's credit rating, resulting in more advantageous pricing and lower overall project costs.
The City's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing will ensure that the new homes permanently serve homeless households through the long-term lease and by providing operating subsidies. The goal of all these partners, on its way to full success, is to reduce the time and cost of building the supportive housing people experiencing homelessness so urgently need.
""Philanthropy has the ability to act quickly and take risks to identify bold solutions to some of our community's greatest challenges,"" said Daniel Lurie, Chairman of the Board of Tipping Point Community. ""This project is a great example of how private donors can provide risk capital for a proof of concept, and work with government to sustain the solution for the long run.""
""Two years ago, the Housing Accelerator Fund set out on an ambitious mission: to cut the time it takes to build permanent supportive housing in half and to significantly reduce production costs,"" said Rebecca Foster, CEO of the Housing Accelerator Fund. ""In partnership with Mercy Housing, Tipping Point Community, and the City of San Francisco, we are thrilled to be achieving these goals. Many thanks to our partners for helping advance the innovations that will soon result in 145 new, beautiful homes for people experiencing homelessness.""
""By deploying modular construction and an entrepreneurial financing approach, this project demonstrates the potential for time and costs savings for developing affordable housing in San Francisco,"" said Doug Shoemaker, President, Mercy Housing California.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, now more than ever, that housing is essential to good health care and that all of our health and wellbeing is intertwined. Protecting the health of people experiencing homelessness is essential to safeguard the health of all. With this in mind, the City has not stopped the housing placement process and continues to connect people with PSH and rapid rehousing.
The City is also actively aligning local and state resources and strategies to acquire hotels for long-term housing options. While there are many devastating impacts of COVID-19, the City plans to continue working with the public and private partners to grow and improve the housing solutions to homelessness.

The City's Fourth of July celebration and fireworks show are canceled this year; San Francisco Fire Department reminds residents of fireworks dangers
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and City officials today encouraged San Franciscans and Bay Area residents to celebrate the Fourth of July weekend safely to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to prevent fires in the city.
San Francisco typically hosts a Fourth of July Waterfront Celebration with a fireworks show, which usually attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city. This year, the celebration is canceled and residents are reminded to follow all San Francisco Public Health Orders, including the requirement to wear face coverings and stay at least six feet apart, if they leave their homes or visit San Francisco. San Francisco law prohibits the discharge of fireworks except for public displays. San Franciscans are reminded that fireworks remain illegal and pose a real danger to residents.
""The Fourth of July is normally a time to gather and celebrate with family, friends and neighbors. Unfortunately these are not normal times, and these types of gatherings are the environments in which COVID-19 spread,"" said Mayor Breed. ""It is critical that all of us continue to follow the Health Orders designed to protect our safety. Please think carefully and act responsibly this weekend.""
""Each year, more than 12,000 fireworks-related injuries are treated in hospital emergency rooms and half of them are children,"" said Fire Chief Jeanine Nicholson. ""Firework accidents cause millions of dollars in property loss each year, including vegetation fires that threaten homes and whole communities.""
""At Fisherman's Wharf and in our northeastern neighborhoods, we are working to responsibly reopen,"" said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who represents the northeastern waterfront. ""How we act this weekend will have a direct impact on our recovery so it is critical that residents and visitors abide by all Health Orders, including wearing facial coverings.""
""The City and County of San Francisco annually welcomes families from areas near and far for our waterfront celebration and fireworks show,"" said City Administrator Naomi M. Kelly. ""This year we are canceling the celebration and fireworks show to keep our communities safe. We encourage families and individuals to stay home and celebrate with members of their immediate households.""
Over the weekend, residents are encouraged to call 9-1-1 only for police, fire, or medical emergencies. Calling 9-1-1 for fireworks calls may delay calls for service, and residents are encouraged to use 3-1-1 instead.
""We want to make sure our officers can respond quickly and effectively to protect public safety in San Francisco,"" said Police Chief William Scott. ""Please reserve 9-1-1 for emergencies, such as crimes in progress or emergency medical needs. Calls about noise and noncriminal activity will only delay priority police, fire and medical response, so please use 3-1-1.""
Residents and visitors should call 3-1-1, rather than 9-1-1, for the following calls:
3-1-1 services can also be accessed at sf311.org or via the 3-1-1 app.

June 29, 2020
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today issued the following statement committing to implement the initial recommendations made by City Attorney Dennis Herrera and Controller Ben Rosenfield, resulting from their investigation into wrongdoing by San Francisco Public Works:
""From the beginning of the federal investigation into San Francisco Public Works, I have said that nothing matters more than restoring public trust in government. I am committed to doing the work to strengthen oversight and accountability in all our departments to prevent future wrongdoing and corruption.
Starting today, we will immediately take action to begin implementing the reforms recommended by the City Attorney and Controller. If we can take Executive action, we will do so immediately. If we need to pass laws, we will work with the Board of Supervisors to do so. To that end, I am rescinding the delegation of authority that was granted to the Director of Public Works in 2011 relating to various approval and contracting actions, as recommended in this initial report. I know these are the first in a series of recommendations, and we need to continue to identify problematic issues that erode public trust across our city. We have work to do, but we will do that work. Our residents and City workers deserve nothing less.
I want to thank the City Attorney and Controller for their work on these important reforms, which is a critical step to restoring the public trust. They have done this even as their offices have been integral in helping to meet the challenges facing our city during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Initiative to include free online and digital resources through ""Museums from Home"" in addition to free or reduced admission to local museums and cultural institutions for San Francisco residents who receive public benefits
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the second summer of the San Francisco Museums For All initiative, which will build upon last year's program to provide free or reduced admissions to local museums and cultural institutions for low-income San Franciscans who receive public benefits, including Medi-Cal and CalFresh.
The City's reopening plan and timeline was updated on Monday, June 22 to allow for indoor museum programming to begin as early as June 29. As some indoor museums reopen with modifications, the San Francisco Museums For All program will work with museum partners to provide free or reduced admission to museums and cultural institutions for San Franciscans that receive public benefits through the summer.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many local museums and cultural institutions have shifted to online or digital programming. As such, the program is also being updated to include
""San Francisco Museums From Home,"" a catalog of resources that provide free online access for members of the public to exhibits, activities, and interactive programs at over a dozen local museums and cultural institutions.
""As San Francisco works to safely reopen and help people get back to work, I am excited that many of our local museums will continue to open their doors to all San Franciscans, regardless of their income, so everyone has the opportunity to access our City's world-class arts and cultural institutions,"" said Mayor Breed. ""As families continue to take precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, expanding this initiative to include free online programming will help connect even more families and children to the arts.""
Nearly one in four San Franciscans receive public benefits from the San Francisco Human Services Agency (HSA). With thousands more San Franciscans applying for public benefits through HSA in the time since Mayor Breed declared a local emergency due to coronavirus, and nearly one in five San Franciscans experiencing unemployment, the number of families eligible for San Francisco Museums For All is expected to increase dramatically.
Admission fees at many museums and cultural institutions can range from $20 to $150 for a family of four to visit, creating a barrier for many people to access the cultural and educational benefits that these institutions offer. The San Francisco Museums For All program aims to break down that barrier to open doors of opportunity for families, especially low-income families, to experience arts and cultural education programming.
In its first summer, more than 25,000 San Franciscans participated in Museums For All program, visiting museums and cultural institutions including SF MoMA, the California Academy of Sciences, the de Young Museum, and nearly a dozen others. A full list of last year's participating museums and cultural institutions is below. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while indoor museum programs are able to reopen as soon as June 29, residents are strongly encouraged to visit the museums' websites or contact museums directly for more details on each institution's reopening plan.
""We are joined in a common experience as residents of a great city when we visit San Francisco's history and science and art museums,"" said Trent Rhorer, Executive Director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency. ""I'm proud that at this moment, when so many are experiencing setbacks, the city's cultural institutions are sustaining their commitment to a common goal of inclusion.""
The San Francisco Museums For All program was created in collaboration with Treasurer José Cisneros's Financial Justice Project, which works to ensure that lower-income residents receive discounts on fines and fees that place a disproportionate burden on low-income families, and to streamline eligibility processes for these discounts. It was also created in collaboration with San Francisco Grants for the Arts and the San Francisco Arts Commission.
""No one should be excluded from the rich cultural life our city because of the size of their wallet,"" said Treasurer Jose Cisneros. ""San Francisco Museums For All ensures our cultural institutions are open and accessible to everyone.""
""I greatly appreciate the museums joining us in this effort,"" said Matthew Goudeau, Director of Grants for the Arts. ""It's been a challenging time for most of these institutions, yet they have stepped up in significant ways to partner with the City to expand access to their spaces, whether in-person or virtual. Together, we will continue to remove barriers that prevent all people, regardless of income, from enjoying the best of San Francisco's cultural offerings.""
""The Arts Commission is excited to support San Francisco Museums For All in its second year, ensuring all San Franciscans have access to diverse cultural experiences, and the transformative power of art,"" said Rebekah Krell, Acting Director of Cultural Affairs for the San Francisco Arts Commission.
When museums that participate in San Francisco Museums For All reopen, residents who currently receive Medi-Cal or CalFresh benefits from HSA can receive free or reduced admission at participating museums for up to four individuals when they present their Electronic Benefits Transfer or Medi-Cal card and proof of San Francisco residency.

Additional businesses and activities that will open include hair salons, barbers, museums, zoos, and outdoor bars, as long as the State approves San Francisco's request for a variance and health indicators remain stable
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced the next phase of the City's reopening will begin on Monday, June 29. Some businesses and activities originally planned to open in mid-July or later will be allowed to open, including hair salons, barbers, museums, zoos, tattoo parlors, massage establishments, nail salons and outdoor bars. Once the City's request for a variance from the California Department of Public Health is approved, and as long as San Francisco continues meetings several key health indicators, the City will allow these businesses and social activities to resume with required safety protocols in place.
""Thanks to San Franciscans' efforts to follow health requirements, wear face coverings, and practice social distancing, our COVID-19 health indicators are in a good place and we can continue reopening our city,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We know a lot of businesses and residents are struggling financially, and this next step will help get more San Franciscans back to work while still balancing safety. I want to thank the Economic Recovery Task Force and the Department of Public Health for continuing to work together to move our City forward safely. We are very much living with COVID-19, and I know that San Francisco residents will continue to prioritize public health as we reopen so that we can keep our entire City healthy.""
On Tuesday, June 16, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a motion allowing for the Department of Public Health (DPH) to seek a variance from the state, which would allow local control to open more businesses ahead of the state's current phasing. The Department of Public Health has submitted the request for a variance and is waiting for approval from the state.
The public's continued partnership and cooperation with face coverings and other health precautions such as social distancing, frequent handwashing, staying home if sick, and cleaning frequently touched surfaces are essential to continue reopening.
""We appreciate the Governor's recognition that gradual reopening depends on local circumstances and the health indicators in each community,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""We will continue to closely monitor those indicators in San Francisco as we partner with City and community leaders on careful reopening. We expect COVID-19 cases to increase as we reopen. To keep that increase manageable and sustain our commitment to protecting the people most vulnerable to the virus, everyone in San Francisco must continue to take the precautions that save lives.""
San Francisco's Stay Home Health Order remains in effect and is gradually being amended to allow for a safer reopening. On Monday, June 15, the City entered into Phase 2B of its local reopening plan. San Francisco entered Phase 2A of the reopening plan on June 1, 2020 and on June 12, 2020 allowed outdoor dining with safety protocols to begin. In conjunction with outdoor dining, the City is offering free permits for businesses to occupy the sidewalk and other public property to operate their business through the Shared Spaces program.
If the State approves the City's variance request and San Francisco continues meeting several key health indicators, the Health Officer will issue an amendment to the Stay Home Health Order, allowing additional businesses and activities to resume. Once issued, that amendment will allow the following activities and businesses to resume on June 29:
San Francisco's reopening plan is based on a San Francisco-specific risk model to control the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health. The plan is also informed by the work of the San Francisco COVID-19 Economic Recovery Task Force and the Department of Public Health monitoring of the virus.
""The Task Force has been working hard to support local businesses on reopening. Moving forward with opening personal services is especially important because unlike other types of businesses, nail salons, barbershops and aestheticians haven't been able to continue through online sales or offer services at curbside,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, co-chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""In addition, from an equity perspective, these businesses also disproportionately impact women and communities of color.""
""San Francisco's global leadership in flattening the curve continues to result in more and more opportunities for safe re-engagement in the civic, cultural and economic activities that make living here so special,"" said Joaquin Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""As summer begins, we know the businesses and public institutions included in this round of reopening will come as a breath of fresh air for San Franciscans and the hardworking people set to reopen their doors and welcome us back while keeping us safe.""
As the City reopens with a focus on safety and equity, DPH will continue to track the impact of the virus on the community and health system to inform public policy. As people start to move about the City more and increase activities, San Francisco will likely experience increases in cases and hospitalizations. The City will also address the disparities already identified for low-wage workers, people who must leave home to work, and workers who live in crowded conditions as San Francisco continues to reopen.
San Francisco's health indicators are an important tool to monitor the level of COVID-19 in the community and the ability of our health care system to meet the needs of residents. The Health Indicators monitor cases, hospital system, testing, contact tracing and personal protective equipment. The Health Indicators are not an on/off switch for the reopening, but instead measure the pandemic in San Francisco and the City's ability to manage it. They are posted on the San Francisco COVID-19 Data Tracker so that San Franciscans can stay informed.

Grants for the Arts funding priorities reflect the City's commitment to equitable distribution, with a focus on organizations serving San Francisco's Black and trans communities
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and City Administrator Naomi M. Kelly today announced approximately $12.8 million in general operating support grants to fund 227 arts and cultural organizations that enhance the City's cultural vibrancy. This year's Grants for the Arts (GFTA) funding comes after an internal review of the City's grantmaking to better support organizations embedded in and serving San Francisco's diverse communities.
""We continue to deal with the economic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, and funding for arts organizations is more vital now than ever before,"" said Mayor Breed. ""As a city that prides itself on its diversity, we must continue to distribute funds equitably and support organizations that serve communities in San Francisco who are most in need.""
As president of the Board of Supervisors, Mayor Breed spearheaded Proposition E, a reallocation of the existing hotel tax for arts and culture services. Last year, the Grants for the Arts advisory panel recommended reforms to GFTA in order to ensure more community-based funding. Moreover, GFTA reviewed grantees using a strong equity lens to focus on organizations deeply rooted and serving diverse populations, such as Black and trans communities.
""San Francisco is uniquely positioned because of its vibrant arts and culture and that is what Grants for the Arts seeks to sustain,"" said City Administrator Kelly. ""Even before COVID-19, arts groups faced skyrocketing rents and other cost pressures. These funds will help organizations weather the tough economic times we currently face and emerge stronger after the pandemic.""
""I am honored to be working alongside such a diverse, rigorous and generous advisory panel to support our City leadership in advancing equity in our arts community,"" said Jonathan Moscone, Chair of the Grants for the Arts Advisory Panel. ""All of us on the panel are extremely grateful to the GFTA staff for working tirelessly over the last few months to care for our fragile and vital community.""
The City Administrator manages GFTA, a program that has provided a stable and dependable source for general operating costs to support the City's arts and cultural organizations since 1961. GFTA relies on a dedicated Hotel Tax to provide this critical support.
""The arts are a vitally important economic industry, generating revenue, creating jobs, attracting tourists, and strengthening communities,"" said Matthew Goudeau, Director of Grants for the Arts. ""We are thrilled to be able to invest in these organizations' good work during this time when the arts sector is experiencing immense impacts from the pandemic. Despite our reduced budget resulting from a drop in Hotel Tax revenue, Grants for the Arts was able to find ways to leverage our funding to equitably support a variety of artistic practices and uplift San Francisco's creative economy.""
These investments will help enhance the City's public spaces, provide employment and enrichment to residents, and continue to expand San Francisco's artistic and cultural diversity. A wide breadth of organizations, parades, and festivals have been awarded funds this year, including Project Level, San Francisco Transgender Film Festival, and the Northern California Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Foundation, among many others. These general operating support grants will fund seven organizations not previously funded by GFTA and increase funding for organizations deeply-rooted within the Black and trans communities by an average of 34% over last year.
A complete list of GFTA's Fiscal Year 2021 grants, including the 227 organizations that received GFTA general operating support funding, can be found here.

Nominated by Mayor London Breed, Cohen will bring experience advocating for social justice and police reform to the Commission
San Francisco, CA — The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to approve Malia M. Cohen to serve on the Police Commission. In July, Mayor London N. Breed nominated Cohen to serve on the Commission, the seven-member body charged with setting policy for the Police Department and conducting disciplinary hearings when police conduct charges are filed.
""I am proud to have nominated Malia Cohen to the Police Commission and am excited that she will soon begin serving in this new role. We have the opportunity to reimagine what policing and the criminal justice system looks like in San Francisco, and I know that Malia will be a critical voice on the Commission to guide this transformation and make our system more equitable and just,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Recent police killings and shootings of unarmed African Americans require that we rethink the role that police play in our communities, and this is an issue that Malia has been a leader on her whole career. I'm confident that she'll continue to move this issue forward on the Police Commission and will do so in a way that keeps our community safe while also advancing much-needed change.""
""I want to thank Mayor Breed and the Members of the Board of Supervisors who have placed their confidence in me,"" said Malia Cohen. ""As an African American woman who grew up in San Francisco—and who has the privilege of representing the residents of our City in elected service—I feel a great sense of responsibility. I look forward to working with Executive Director Paul Henderson and DPA staff, SFPD Chief William Scott, and the men and women of our Department, and community justice partners to make progress on the path of reform. I take to heart the recommendations of Mayor Breed in her roadmap for police reforms to fundamentally change the nature of policing in San Francisco, and to address systemic racism. As a Police Commissioner, I will join with my colleagues to ensure continual and transparent reviews of the policies and practices of the SFPD; and will always work to ensure that the voices from all of our communities—particularly persons of color—are heard.""
Cohen serves on the California State Board of Equalization (BOE). She served as the Chair of the BOE in 2019, and she is the first African-American woman to serve on the Board. As a member of the BOE, Cohen represents nearly 10 million constituents in Northern and Central California. Prior to serving on the BOE, she was President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, where she represented District 10 for eight years and was Chair of the Budget and Finance Committee.
Throughout her life, Cohen has fought for diversity and inclusion. As a member of the Board of Supervisors, Cohen was instrumental in banning the use of chokeholds by the San Francisco Police Department. In 2016, she led the effort to create the independent Department of Police Accountability, with expanded powers to audit the police department and investigate all police shootings. In addition to her leadership on police reform, Cohen has championed policies and programs that protect public health, foster economic development, promote new affordable housing, and that create good jobs.
In June, Mayor Breed announced a roadmap to fundamentally change the nature of policing in San Francisco and issued a set of policies to address structural inequities. She proposed four priorities to achieve this vision: ending the use of police in response to non-criminal activity; addressing police bias and strengthening accountability; demilitarizing the police; and promoting economic justice. These policies build on the City's ongoing work to meet the standards contained in President Obama's 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing. In her role on the Commission, Cohen will oversee the development and implementation of these critical reforms.
Cohen was born and raised in San Francisco. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee, and a Masters in Science in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She resides in the Bayview neighborhood with her husband, attorney Warren Pulley.

Earlier than expected closure marks the third jail that San Francisco has closed in the last 10 years
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Sheriff Paul Miyamoto announced today that County Jail #4, located on the 7th floor of the Hall of Justice, will close effective Saturday, September 5, 2020. Last year, Mayor Breed announced a plan to move incarcerated people out of the jail no later than July 2021. In May, the Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance authored by Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer that moved the proposed closure date to no later than November 1, 2020. Built in 1961, County Jail #4 is the third jail that the City will have closed since 2010.
""San Francisco has led the nation in advancing justice reforms for decades, and the closure of County Jail #4 is part of our broader efforts to shift resources towards alternatives to incarceration that are more effective at creating a safer society for us all,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Thanks to Sheriff Miyamoto's leadership, we are able to move forward on closing the jail earlier than we originally planned. We need to continue to reform our criminal justice system to prevent crime in the first place, end the use of incarceration as an answer to social problems, and reduce recidivism. We are all safer if we invest in measures that address the root causes of the majority of criminal behavior. This includes keeping up our programs to divert people to services instead of incarceration, and offering pretrial diversion for those who do not pose a danger to themselves or others with our partners in the court and criminal justice system.""
""When I became Sheriff, I committed to closing County Jail #4. It had outlived its useful life and was seismically unsafe, putting the people in custody, Sheriff's staff, contractors and the visiting public at risk,"" said Sheriff Miyamoto. ""We're in a position to close early due to the efforts of Sheriff's Office staff and our health care partners -- even while continuing to meet the challenges of COVID-19. My staff has worked collaboratively and creatively and has remained focused on finding solutions for transitioning to a reduced living, work and visiting space while being responsive to advocates' concerns. Sheriff's deputies have exceeded expectations and performed their duties at an exceptional level of professionalism with attention to everyone's health and safety.""
County Jail #4 is rated for 402 beds. Since the onset of COVID-19 in March and the corresponding reduction in jail population to limit exposure, County Jail #4's census today is 77 people. Other San Francisco county jails currently have the capacity to absorb additional people in custody. People from County Jail #4 will be rehoused in either County Jail #5 in San Bruno (rated for 768 beds) or County Jail #2 at 425-7th Street in San Francisco (rated for 392 beds).
Since COVID-19 hit, jail and prison populations have been especially vulnerable. While San Francisco county jails have not been immune from the virus, Sheriff Miyamoto and his jail management team, working with Jail Health Services -- a section of the Department of Public Health -- have been a rare success story, working to limit COVID-19 exposure and prevent an outbreak in the jail. While the closure of County Jail #4 reduces custody space, the Sheriff's Office has and continues to develop prevention and safety protocols to intercept and control the virus.
""I am thrilled that we will be closing County Jail 4 much earlier than expected, given the incredible safety and health hazards associated with this facility,"" said Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer. ""Our legislation significantly sped up the timeline for closure, and in the last few months the City has maintained a significant decrease in the jail population, ensuring the facility can be closed safely. Ultimately no one—not incarcerated people, sheriff deputies, or anyone else—should have to spend more time in this dilapidated building.""
""The closure of County Jail 4 has been a long time coming. After years of advocacy by San Francisco public defenders, members of the No New Jails Coalition, and many city leaders, I am very glad that we are finally closing this unsafe facility next week,"" said San Francisco Public Defender Mano Raju. ""The COVID-19 crisis, coupled with the national Black Lives Matter movement, has shined a light on just how important it is for us to be looking at all of our systems, including our law enforcement institutions, through a public health lens as well as a racial justice lens. We have both the responsibility and the opportunity to reexamine our response to harm and the needs of our community by shrinking our jail system in every way possible, and closing County Jail 4 is a critical part of that process.""
""I am proud to fulfill our campaign promise to close County Jail #4 within my first year in office. My team worked hard to safely and dramatically reduce the jail population in San Francisco by carefully reviewing each and every person who was incarcerated,"" said San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin. ""We were able to reduce the jail population by approximately 40 percent by relying on incarceration as a last resort and working closely with our reentry partners to expedite safe release. This significant reduction in the jail population—all while crime rates declined—demonstrates that mass incarceration does not make us safer.""
""The closure of County Jail #4 is a critical milestone in retiring the Hall of Justice, one of the City's most seismically deficient buildings,"" said City Administrator Naomi M. Kelly, who chairs the City's Capital Planning Committee. ""Mayor Breed, Sheriff Miyamoto and the Board of Supervisors worked together to ensure the safety of San Francisco. Planning is currently underway to replace the Hall of Justice with a modern campus that meets our public safety needs.""
In October 2019, Mayor Breed announced a plan to move all incarcerated people out of County Jail #4 no later than July 2021. In May, the Board of Supervisors passed Ordinance 80-20, authored by Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer, which required the City to close County Jail #4 by November 1, 2020. The remaining administrative functions at 850 Bryant will be relocated by summer 2021.
For many years, San Francisco has had one of the nation's lowest incarceration rates, which has been driven by the justice community's commitment to pretrial diversion instead of incarceration. Mayor Breed's significant investment in behavioral mental health and substance use beds along with new investments in pre-trial assessments and sentencing reforms will sustain and expand this commitment. Mayor Breed has also overseen a significant expansion of pretrial release services through the San Francisco Pretrial Diversion Project, support for the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program that redirects individuals to community&dash;based services, and the creation of a pretrial release unit at the Public Defender's Office.
The closure of County Jail #4 is related to Mayor Breed's ongoing efforts to redirect funding from the City's law enforcement agencies and invest in San Francisco's African-American community. The Mayor's proposed budget acknowledges structural inequities resulting from generations of disinvestment and reinvests $120 million in funds over two years, predominately from the City's law enforcement departments, towards efforts to repair the legacy of racially disparate policies on health, housing, and economic outcomes for African-Americans.

August 21, 2020
The African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund will help at least 70 Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurs access much-needed financial capital, with zero-interest loans of up to $50,000
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), Main Street Launch, and the San Francisco African American Chamber of Commerce today announced the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund has grown to $3.2 million. An additional $1.7 million in newly announced funding will provide capital and financial assistance for African American entrepreneurs and Black-owned small businesses in San Francisco impacted by COVID-19.
""Black-owned businesses were already struggling to survive in San Francisco and COVID-19 has just made it even harder. It's critical that we find ways to support our community and help businesses make it through,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We know there are a lot of entrepreneurs and businesses in need—with people struggling to pay rent on their storefronts, support their employees, or have income to afford other basic necessities. Given the lack of continued federal support, San Francisco is stepping up to meet the moment and fill that need with an additional $1.7 million for the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund.""
The purpose of the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund is to help stabilize San Francisco's Black-owned small businesses by meeting urgent capital needs brought on by sudden revenue loss from business disruption resulting from COVID-19. In June, Mayor Breed announced an initial investment of $1.5 million from Give2SF donations to support Black-owned businesses. With an additional investment of $500,000 from Give2SF, the City's lending partner, Main Street Launch, was able to borrow $1.2 million in lending capital for the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund, bringing the total amount of funding for the program to $3.2 million.
""As we continue to invest in the Black community here in San Francisco, we understand that supporting Black business is key to a thriving community,"" said Supervisor Shamann Walton. ""We know that we don't have enough resources to address every need, but we are working hard to keep our businesses open. Increasing the pot for the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund is key to keeping Black businesses afloat during this pandemic and this is a must for survival.""
Nearly 400 businesses applied for the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund during the two-week application period, demonstrating that there is significant need for financial assistance among San Francisco's Black-owned businesses and entrepreneurs. Today, Mayor Breed announced that 40 small businesses were recently selected to start the full application process for zero-interest loans of up to $50,000. Small businesses not invited to move forward in this round will be automatically considered in the next funding round. The $1.7 million expansion in funding will provide for at least an additional 30 loans to small businesses.
""Black-owned businesses anchor our diverse communities, creating places of work that foster creativity, opportunity, community and culture for all San Franciscans,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""We've seen too many of these businesses hit hard by COVID-19, compounding the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on our African-American communities. As a City, we're committed to providing the access to capital and resources necessary to best serve our vital and historically underserved communities and ensuring the ongoing economic and cultural vibrancy of San Francisco.""
The loans are prioritized for long-standing San Francisco African American businesses, especially those businesses most impacted by COVID-19 including those that have not been able to operate since the Stay Home Order was issued in March. A portion of the funds are set aside for small businesses that have not be able to reopen under Health Orders, including hair salons, barber shops and other personal services, gyms and personal fitness, and bars and night life. Funds can be used to pay for rent, payroll, equipment and machinery, inventory, furniture and fixtures, tenant improvements, and COVID-19 related expenses including marketing and improving online presence and reopening costs.
""We have known for some time that Black businesses were hurting badly because of lack of access to capital. Our concerns were validated by the recent release of a UC Santa Cruz report that documented that 41% of Black businesses have closed permanently due to COVID-19. What surprised us with the initial response from nearly 400 businesses was the magnitude approaching $16M and the unfortunate possibility that these businesses could also close for good,"" says Dr. Matthew Ajiake, President of the African American Chamber of Commerce. ""This is why we are grateful to the Mayor, her staff, and Main Street Launch for identifying an additional $1.7 million to bring our direct loan and grant facility to $3.2 million. We know that systemic and structural racism that have historically denied Black businesses access to capital cannot be solved by government and NGOs alone and while the need from these businesses is great, the need for a substantive sustainable source of access to capital for Black businesses in San Francisco is the imperative. Nothing can be worse than watching our culturally sustaining and essential Black businesses in historically Black neighborhoods close forever. So, we appeal to the private sector and persons of goodwill to help us grow this revolving loan fund to $40M. If this goal is reached, our City's economic landscape will be greatly enriched and sustainable to meet the needs of current and future San Francisco Black businesses in a meaningful and measurable way that gives dignity and respect to them.""
""We are a gym, group fitness, personal training, physical therapy and massage business and we have been around since 2005,"" said Mallory Gaston, Owner of Body Mechanix, LLC. ""Due to COVID-19, we have not been able to use our facility for business as usual, and this has forced us to reimagine our business model and what it would take to implement a new model for the future that is safe and sustainable. Funding from the African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund, if we are successful in getting it, would allow us to adapt to this new normal and execute our plan so that our business can survive.""
San Francisco recognizes the oppressive history of racial injustice, the structural inequities that remain today, and the trauma those inequities perpetuate. Specifically, Black-owned businesses were in a perilous environment pre-COVID-19 and that environment has resulted in disproportionate financial impacts due to the pandemic both locally and nationally, creating further uncertainty as the City moves into recovery. Black-owned businesses are over-represented in the hardest hit sectors of the economy and tend to be smaller, with only a third of the revenue of non-black businesses and lower cash reserves. Black-owned businesses also face more hurdles in accessing liquidity and support services, and are 60 percent less likely to receive all of the financing they need, which puts them at additional risk for closure.
Since the pandemic began, San Francisco has allocated $17.2 million to support over 1,130 small businesses through the City's financial relief and assistance package. The COVID-19 financial relief programs were designed to remove barriers to access including personal guarantees and certain collateral requirements.
""Our organization is very excited and honored to broaden our partnership with the honorable Mayor London Breed, San Francisco Office of Economic and Workforce Development, and the San Francisco African American Chamber of Commerce"" says Jacob Singer, President and CEO, Main Street Launch. ""This newly expanded African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund will help to bridge the capital gap while providing a foundation for immediate stability and future growth of Black owned businesses in San Francisco.
The African American Small Business Revolving Loan Fund is part of San Francisco's COVID-19 financial relief package that includes other grant and loan programs that complement citywide efforts to support micro-enterprises and small businesses historically underserved by private banks and other traditional sources of financing. The investments reflect the City's commitment to ensuring a more equitable recovery and inclusive future economy.

During this unprecedented public health emergency, Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes over $4 million investment over the next two years to continue essential rental subsidies and housing support services for low-income transgender residents and HIV-positive San Franciscans
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced over $4 million in funding to provide rental subsidies for people living with HIV/AIDS and for transgender San Franciscans. Mayor Breed's proposed budget for Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 will allow the City to continue funding critical rental assistance and housing support programs, which prevent eviction and stabilize tenancies for some of the City's most vulnerable residents who continued to be greatly impacted by the global pandemic and economic crisis.
Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes $2 million annually in Fiscal Years 20-21 and 21-22 to maintain critical rental subsidies and supportive services. This includes annually:
""We continue to keep the health and safety of our communities as our number one priority and this means keeping our residents in their homes,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We know that the economic and health impact of the pandemic is disproportionately impacting communities of color specifically our Black and Latino residents, our already underserved trans and gender nonconforming housing insecure community members, as well as those who are more at risk including those who are HIV-positive. During these unprecedented times we must continue and expand our investments in getting and keeping our most vulnerable communities housed.""
""Even in San Francisco, trans and gender nonconforming and HIV-positive residents face higher rates of housing insecurity and significant health disparities,"" said Supervisor Rafael Mandelman. ""In this COVID era, these rental subsidies will help keep our most vulnerable residents housed and healthy over the next two years.""
""San Francisco made history last year with these critical investments, we are grateful for Mayor Breed's continued partnership and investment in our most underserved communities,"" said Clair Farley, Director of the Office of Transgender Initiatives. ""Now more than ever with the public health emergency, economic crisis, and continued attacks by the Federal Government we need to assure our most impacted residents have access to safe, inclusive and affordable housing.""
""We are so proud to collaborate with Mayor Breed and our non-profit partners on the expansion of our housing stability efforts in the trans and gender nonconforming and HIV+ communities,"" said Eric Shaw, Director of the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development. ""These targeted housing subsidies are crucial tools that allow us to combat the vast inequities the pandemic has exposed.""
In addition to the rental subsidy programs for transgender and HIV+ residents, the City has a wide portfolio of rental and housing subsidies for seniors, people with disabilities, youth, families, and formerly homeless individuals living in permanent supportive housing.
Our Trans Home SF
Our Trans Home SF program supports low-income transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) community members find or keep their housing through rental subsidies, housing navigation, and case management. One out of every two transgender San Franciscans have experienced homelessness and TGNC people are 18 times more likely to experience homelessness. This unique and vital program provides the TGNC community much-needed housing stability.
Since December 2019, Our Trans Home SF has provided one time emergency and ongoing rental subsidies for over 65 community members. The program also provides housing navigation services and transitional housing support services.
Mayor Breed prioritized funding the program in the previous City Budget with $2.3 million through MOHCD and the Office of Transgender Initiatives. In September 2019, MOHCD awarded funding to St. James Infirmary and Larkin Street Youth Services to implement the new initiative.
""We must continue to prioritize housing for trans and non-binary communities because we face pervasive discrimination in housing, employment, and healthcare. Trans and non-binary communities experience homelessness at a rate 18x the general population and have much higher rates of underlining health conditions that put us at greater risk for COVID-related illness, such as HIV, cancer, diabetes and asthma. Shelter in place has further exacerbated mental health challenges as well relating to increased isolation."" said Akira Jackson, Director of TAJA's Coalition and Consultant on the Our Trans Home SF housing project at St. James. ""With this continued investment, we can make sure our community members most impacted by transphobic discrimination and violence have equitable access to safe and supportive housing with wrap around medical and mental health services during the pandemic and beyond.""

HIV/AIDS Rent Subsidy Program
The HIV/AIDS Rent Subsidy Program launched in December 2019 and is San Francisco's first new rental subsidy program for people living with HIV/AIDS in 12 years. The rental subsidies have been administered to approximately 120 individuals who are HIV positive. To qualify for the program, people must be either currently housed and paying more than 70 percent of their income toward rent, or offered below-market rate housing in San Francisco, but in need of a subsidy.
The City Budget for FY 19-20 included $1 million for the HIV/AIDS Rent Subsidy Program. In 2019, MOHCD awarded funding to the Q Foundation to administer the program. In addition to this subsidy program, the City has long provided rental subsidies for people living with HIV and AIDS through the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) Program.
""Mayor London Breed's initial investment in the first new HIV subsidies in SF in 12 years is already yielding incredible results,"" said Brian Basinger, Executive Director, Q Foundation. ""Thanks to her support, in the first 7 months, we have provided over 10,000 nights of stable housing to over 100 households for less than $25 per night. The fact that this happened in the middle of COVID-19 shelter in place is a testament to the dedication, resilience and grit of my team at Q Foundation and of the HIV+ community, who know how to overcome adversity.""
In 2014, San Francisco City agencies and organizations came together in a collective impact initiative known as Getting to Zero. This initiative brings together people and resources from throughout the city with three goals in mind: zero new HIV infections, zero HIV-related deaths and zero stigma and discrimination.
Helping HIV positive individuals remain housed or find housing advances the City's goal of ""getting to zero"" new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths. Stable housing allows people to more easily access the regular health care and medications they need to achieve viral suppression. Viral suppression drugs have made HIV a survivable disease for many, but there is a major disparity when it comes to people who are marginally housed or homeless. Thirty-three percent of homeless persons living with HIV in San Francisco are virally suppressed, compared to 74 percent of housed persons.

August 18, 2020
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed issued the following statement following the Board of Supervisors' 6-4 vote against the appointment of Jane Natoli to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) Board of Directors.
""The Board of Supervisors' decision to reject the nomination of Jane Natoli for the SFMTA Board is a deeply cynical move that represents what is wrong with San Francisco politics. And let's be clear, this is simply about politics.
The Board made her wait for over 100 days just to have a hearing. During this time, the SFMTA Board could barely make a quorum while the SFMTA is having to make countless difficult decisions as a result of COVID-19. When Jane finally received a hearing, the Board did not question her qualifications, in fact she received a unanimously positive recommendation in her committee hearing. Jane is a transit rider, a bicycle rider, and a transportation advocate who is well-respected for her advocacy. She would have been the first trans Director in the history of the SFMTA Board, bringing a unique perspective that the SFMTA Board has never had before. But the Supervisors decided that their political differences with her are more important than having qualified Directors on the SFMTA Board.
We should be thankful that people are willing to provide their expertise and serve our City. The message that the Board of Supervisors continues to send is that it does not matter if you are qualified, in order to serve San Francisco you must be aligned with them politically.""

1,100 new homes—50% affordable—built next to City College will prioritize family-friendly housing and affordable housing for educators
San Francisco, CA — The Board of Supervisors voted yesterday to approve the Development Agreement for a housing project at the Balboa Reservoir site. After five years of a community engagement process, Board of Supervisors President Norman Yee introduced legislation in April to initiate the first steps of the City's review of the housing project. The project is an important part of Mayor London N. Breed's efforts to create more housing in San Francisco, and includes building 1,100 new homes with 50% dedicated for affordable homes for families and essential workers, four acres of public open space, a 100-seat childcare center with 50% of the seats reserved for children of low-income families, and a community meeting space. Situated next to City College, it will include 150 affordable educator units to be prioritized for City College faculty and staff housing.
""San Francisco is still in the midst of a housing shortage, and we need to continue to build more homes throughout the entire city,"" said Mayor Breed. ""The Balboa Reservoir housing project will create over a thousand new homes for families, for workers, and for teachers, while also providing much-needed open space and childcare facilities. This project is a victory for San Francisco and our residents, and will help make the City a more affordable place to live. I want to thank President Yee and all the City staff who have worked tirelessly to make this project a reality.""
""Overall, the Balboa Reservoir project captures all the elements the community fought for over the years,"" said President Yee. ""The neighbors and the City College community were deeply engaged with shaping the project. We have come a long way and I believe we achieved the best possible project to bring online 550 affordable new homes for low- and middle-income families in perpetuity. City College educators and staff will also get first preference to 150 educator housing units. This project will be one of the first to actively incorporate child-friendly design elements to ensure that the housing attracts families with children and multi-generational households. Moreover, there will be a new public park, a community center, and a quality childcare center. It is not enough to just build housing, but to also provide connectivity and encourage diversity for a complete, inclusive neighborhood. I want families to see their future here in the neighborhood I was fortunate enough to raise my own children in.""
The Balboa Reservoir property is an approximately 17-acre parcel that the City and County of San Francisco owns under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. It is located in the West of Twin Peaks area of south-central San Francisco, north of the Ocean Avenue commercial district, and directly west of the City College of San Francisco Ocean Campus.
The project was approved unanimously this spring by the Planning Commission, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, and the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Board. Supervisor Norman Yee established the Balboa Reservoir Community Advisory Committee in 2015, which included representatives for neighborhood associations, including Westwood Park, Sunnyside Neighborhood Association, and the Ocean Avenue Association. The Committee provided a public forum to establish principles and parameters for the potential project that guided the City's selection of a development team.
The Development Agreement, Special Use District, General Plan Amendment, and SFPUC Purchase and Sale Resolution approved today at the Board of Supervisors is the result of five years of collaboration between the community, City officials, and City College. The Developer Team will be a partnership between BRIDGE Housing and Avalon Bay Communities with Mission Housing and Habitat for Humanity participating in the affordable housing component of the project.
Community Driven Project
The project proposal is a response to more than five years of neighborhood outreach and discussion. From neighborhood meetings and workshops in 2014, the Balboa Reservoir Community Advisory Community (BRCAC) was formed. Over the following year and a half, the BRCAC created the parameters and goals for the project, and subsequently helped select the developer team. Since their 2017 selection, the Development Team continued to work with the BRCAC to refine the master plan and complete the environmental review.
550 Affordable Homes
Half of the 1,100 total homes will be affordable to low- and moderate-income families (30% to 120% of Area Median Income). The affordable housing parcels that receive local financing will be deeded back to the City. Over 25% of the affordable units will be dedicated to educator housing, with a first preference for City College faculty and staff.
A New Neighborhood Park and Open Green Spaces
The development will include a new two-acre public park, located at the center of the new neighborhood and easily accessible to all community members. This is part of four acres of total public open space, including recreation areas and pedestrian ways.
Child-Friendly Project: Childcare and Community Spaces
A new childcare center will provide 100 spaces for children from families at a range of income levels, with 50% of the seats reserved for children of low-income families, and will serve the surrounding community and families who move into the new homes. The project will include a large indoor community space on the ground floor adjacent to the public park. The project will also include housing design elements that will be targeted for families with children and will be guided by the San Francisco Planning Department's Family-Friendly Housing General Plan Amendment and Design Review Guidelines that are part of Mayor Breed and President Yee's San Francisco Child and Youth-Friendly City Initiative.
Transportation Improvements
The project will pay approximately $10 million in Transportation Sustainability Fees to the City for transit and infrastructure improvements. The new neighborhood is designed around transit-first principles to encourage new residents to walk, bike, and ride transit. As a mitigation measure, the project will improve traffic signaling and rearrange dedicated turn arrows along Ocean Avenue, aiding transit and automobile flow.
Collaboration with City College
City College staff and educators will have first preference on over 25% of the affordable units. Public parking options will be available to the City College community to accommodate the redevelopment of the existing reservoir parking lot. Neighborhood design and community amenities will be arranged to provide easy access to the City College community and to complement planned new College buildings.

Mayor Breed's budget proposal includes significant General Fund investments in COVID-19 response
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today presented her budget proposal to continue the City's ongoing response to COVID-19 in the next fiscal year. The COVID-19 budget investments are part of the Mayor's two year budget proposal, which Mayor Breed announced on Friday, July 31, and which balances a $1.5 billion deficit with a responsible use of reserves, preserving jobs and with minimal impact to City services.
In total, Mayor Breed's proposed budget allocates $446.1 million to ensure the City has the financial resources to meet the citywide priorities set forth by the COVID-19 Command Center, the centralized emergency operations center coordinating the response across City departments. The Mayor's budget assumes the City's General Fund will support $93 million of that total amount, and that the remaining amount will be covered through a combination of FEMA reimbursement, state grants, and funding from the CARES Act. Additionally, the $446.1 million in expenditures for COVID-19 are budgeted in only FY 2020-21 in the Mayor's proposed budget. If there is a significant surge in cases or the pandemic requires the current level of response after July 2021, additional funding will be required.
""The spending I have proposed for the City's COVID-19 response is an investment in San Francisco's public health, but it is also so much more than that. Controlling this virus until we have a vaccine is critical to keeping our residents safe, allowing our businesses to operate, and helping our economy to recover,"" said Mayor Breed. ""San Francisco has been a national leader is our COVID-19 response but we cannot get complacent. We know this virus is going to be with us for months to come, and we need to continue to build on the progress we have made with these investments.""
""As we respond to the COVID pandemic, it is critical for us to remain strong, focused and well-coordinated,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""We must maintain our investment in public health to keep our community safe and save lives, and Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes the funding we need to respond to COVID-19.""
""Being able to effectively execute the City's response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires complex coordination, communication and operations,"" said Mary Ellen Carroll, Executive Director, Department of Emergency Management. ""It also means we need sufficient resources to keep our city as protected as possible from this virus. The COVID-19 Command Center is where many city agencies work together to combine strategies that fight COVID-19, and having the support of the Mayor's proposed budget means we will be able to sustain this essential work to protect our community.""
""San Francisco is facing the steepest economic slide in modern history. As our COVID-19 response continues to protect public health and help businesses recover, people who are confronting the loss of a job or health insurance will need to turn to the City in new ways to help them through this crisis,"" said Trent Rhorer, Executive Director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency. ""At this time of great economic uncertainty, the Mayor's proposed budget includes significant new funding to prevent hunger, increase access to employment, and provide emergency housing to the families and communities who need this assistance the most.""
Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes funding to ensure the City is able to continue its comprehensive, data-driven, and public health-focused response to the ongoing health threats and economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding will be directed to four main categories: health operations; housing and shelter programs; food security and human services; and emergency communications and operations.
Health Operations
In total, the Mayor's budget allocates $184.9 million for health operations. The Mayor's budget ensures there is adequate funding for COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment, expanded capacity at hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, outbreak management, and contact tracing, among other expenses. The most significant health expense is testing at $55.9 million, followed by citywide personal protective equipment at $44.2 million. The health operations category also includes $12.7 million for community outreach and engagement in priority neighborhoods, congregate settings, and communities at high risk of exposure.
Housing and Shelter Programs
The proposed budget includes investments to address the needs of San Francisco's unsheltered residents in the COVID-19 environment with shelter, food, and medical care. The budget provides $182.9 million for housing and shelter programs, including hotel rooms for vulnerable individuals without access to housing to safely shelter-in-place or recover from COVID-19.
Food Security and Human Services
Throughout COVID-19, addressing food insecurity has remained one of Mayor Breed's and the City's top priorities. The Mayor's proposed budget includes $45.8 million in new expenditures for food programs. The budget also includes $16 million to continue the City's expansion of the Pit Stop program.
Emergency Communications and Operations
In total, the Mayor's proposed budget allocates $16.5 million for emergency communications and operations. The proposed budget includes $12.9 million for staffing and operations at the City's COVID Command Center, including $3.6 million in funding for multi-lingual communications, outreach, and education during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Give2SF
The Give2SF COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund has also been a major source for investment in economic recovery-focused initiatives. In March 2020, the City established Give2SF, a fund for the City to accept tax-deductible donations to fund efforts in three priority areas (1) food security; (2) access to housing; and (3) security for workers and small businesses. Give2SF raised over $28 million in FY 2019-20 and has dedicated funds to various programs, including meal programs for seniors, grocery gift cards for undocumented and mixed-status households, food pantries for low-income San Franciscans, small business emergency grants, small business no-interest loans, and financial assistance for rent, mortgage, and other housing costs. Funds directed towards these efforts will continue to be disbursed throughout FY 2020-21.
Budget Timeline
Mayor Breed's proposed budget is now before the Budget and Finance Committee, after which it will go before the full Board of Supervisors. Following approval by the Board of Supervisors, the budget for FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 will go to the Mayor for her signature and final adoption by October 1, 2020.

August 11, 2020
Paramedic and public health-led teams to assist people experiencing behavioral health emergencies are part of budget funding for mental health priorities, including increasing behavioral health bed capacity, creating an Office of Coordinated Care, & expanding hours at Behavioral Health Access Center
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced a plan to create a Street Crisis Response Team pilot program, which would begin the effort to fundamentally change the way San Francisco responds to 911 and 311 calls regarding behavioral health emergencies, involving mental health and substance use. The goal for this new team is to provide an appropriate non-law enforcement response to behavioral health emergencies in San Francisco and divert individuals in crisis away from emergency rooms and criminal justice settings into behavioral health treatment facilities.
""When people are experiencing a mental health crisis on our streets, we want to be able to respond in a way that is most appropriate and gets the person connected with the care and support they need,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Often, calls to 911 or 311 about someone who appears to be having a behavioral health emergency don't actually need an armed police response. In fact, that type of response can sometimes makes things worse. With this pilot program, we're taking the first step toward redirecting non-violent calls from police to other resources, and are expanding behavioral health services in San Francisco. Because even though we've been focused the past few months on our COVID-19 emergency response, the other challenges on our streets with mental illness and substance use disorder haven't gone away, and we must remain focused on addressing that ongoing public health crisis as well.""
The Mayor's proposed budget for Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 includes $4 million from the General Fund to pilot a Street Crisis Response Team to help San Franciscans who are experiencing behavioral health crises. If the consensus Business Tax Reform ballot measure passes in November, Proposition C revenues will enable the City to direct a total of approximately $16.8 million to the pilot program over two years, which would expand the program and create additional Street Crisis Response Teams.
""The Crisis Response teams are a critical part of the Mental Health SF law we authored,"" said Supervisor Hillary Ronen. ""I appreciate that the Mayor has dedicated significant funding to implement our comprehensive law and I look forward to fighting for additional funds throughout the budget process.""
""We wrote Mental Health SF with frontline providers to address the suffering on our streets and the lack of immediate response and support for people in crisis,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney. ""Maximizing 24 hour crisis response teams with experts responding to crises before they escalate is as essential and urgent as ever. This is a great start to fully implementing Mental Health SF.""
""Every day San Franciscans encounter people in crisis on our streets but don't know who to call for help,"" said Supervisor Rafael Mandelman. ""This city desperately needs a more effective response to behavioral health crises than the police can provide; we need teams of trained medical professionals and peers with the skills to actually make a difference in the lives of unhoused people with mental illnesses and the neighborhoods in which they take refuge. That's why street crisis response teams were identified as a top recommendation by the Meth Task Force, are a key component of Mental Health SF, and are a top priority in Mayor Breed's proposed budget. I am grateful for this important step towards full implementation of this critical reform.""
The Street Crisis Response Team pilot program is part of the first phase of implementation of Mental Health SF, the City's strategic framework for improving the behavioral health response to people experiencing homelessness. In addition to funding the Street Crisis Response Team, Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes funding to establish an Office of Coordinated Care within the Department of Public Health, increasing behavioral health bed capacity to reduce wait times to access treatment beds, and expanding service hours at the Behavioral Health Access Center.
In June, Mayor Breed announced that the City is in the process of creating a system to divert non-violent calls from the Police Department to other first responders. Establishing a Street Crisis Response Team is an essential part of this system and enables appropriate calls to be directed toward behavioral health and medical professionals.
The Street Crisis Response Team will be a collaboration between the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Francisco Fire Department and will provide appropriate clinical interventions and care coordination for people who experience behavioral health crises on the streets of San Francisco. Each team will include a community paramedic from the Fire Department, and a behavioral health clinician and behavioral health peer from the Department of Public Health. The team will be dispatched to address calls for service by both the 911 and 311 call centers. In addition, individuals can be connected to additional services and would be supported by DPH to engage in these services and to ensure follow-up care is coordinated.
Through pairing behavioral health specialists and medical professionals, the Street Crisis Response Team can begin to respond to some of the calls to which the San Francisco Police Department would otherwise respond. These include suicide or self-harm calls and calls for assistance to people who are presenting as disoriented, or who have other symptoms of intoxication or psychosis.
The service model for the Street Crisis Response Team is unique in the incorporation of peer support workers with lived experience of homelessness, mental illness, and/or substance use disorder. Peer support workers are people who have been successful in the recovery process and are skilled to help others experiencing similar situations. This team will coordinate with the Department of Public Health's Street Medicine team, the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing's Homeless Outreach Team, and the Fire Department's EMS-6 team.
""Department of Public Health clinicians and San Francisco Fire Department paramedics, who have a long history of partnership, will join people with lived experience of behavioral health challenges as they team up to resolve nonviolent crises on our streets,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""Bringing together these three distinct skill sets is an evidence-based crisis response model that we are proud to pilot in San Francisco.""
""The San Francisco Fire Department has run a specialized unit for the past 4 years with trained community paramedics,"" said Chief Jeanine Nicholson, San Francisco Fire Department. ""They provide compassionate advocacy and medical assessment in order to connect vulnerable people to definitive care for acute medical, mental health, and social needs. Our approach has proven very effective. We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the Department of Public Health and expand this program. As a city, we will be able to provide these services on a larger scale and facilitate access to care for those experiencing behavioral crises on our streets.""

August 10, 2020
San Francisco has become the first county in the nation to stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families, lifting an economic burden from low-income communities, boosting connection to support networks, and easing re-entry
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, Sheriff Paul Miyamoto, and Treasurer José Cisneros announced that all phone calls from county jails are now free, effective today. San Francisco County is the first in the country to permanently stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families through phone calls, commissary markups, or other services. In providing free phone calls, the Sheriff's Office negotiated a first-in-the-nation fixed rate contract with GTL, a jail phone service contractor, to ensure the lowest possible cost to the City and taxpayers.
""When people are in jail they need to be able to stay connected with their family without being concerned about how much it will cost them or their loved ones. Being able to stay in touch with family is always important, but it is even more critical during a health emergency like COVID-19,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This change is an important continuation of our efforts to reform fines and fees that disproportionately impact low-income people and communities of color. This has truly been a team effort, and I want to thank everyone who contributed to this work for their dedication and advocacy.""
""I am grateful to my staff who worked tirelessly over the last year to advance high-impact justice reform. They created a contract that serves both the needs of in-custody people while delivering the best taxpayer return on investment,"" said Sheriff Miyamoto. ""Our contract is quickly becoming a model for other jurisdictions. We would not have been able achieve this as well as other financial justice reforms without the support and commitment from Mayor Breed, Treasurer Cisneros, Supervisor Fewer and her colleagues, and the criminal justice community.""
""I am thrilled to see free phone calls being implemented in SF jails, and know that this will have a tangible impact on the lives of incarcerated people and their loved ones,"" said Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer. ""This new contract again puts our city on the map as leading policy change in the name of economic justice—and where San Francisco leads, the nation will follow.""
Marking up prices for phone calls and commissary items is a common practice in jails and prisons across the country, but San Francisco now joins a growing number of cities, counties and states that are reducing or eliminating these costs, including New York City. The plan to make jail phone calls free and end commissary markups was funded in Mayor Breed's budget for Fiscal Year 2019-20 and was developed by the Sheriff's Office over the past year.
Under the new contract with GTL, rather than paying the vendor per call minute as families did, the City will pay the vendor a fixed monthly rate per phone device. The innovative cost structure better reflects the cost of service paid by the vendor to provide access to phones in all county jails. The new contract also allows for free video calls.
The contract is a win-win for incarcerated people and the City of San Francisco. In 2018, incarcerated people and their families paid over a million dollars for phone calls from San Francisco jails. In 2020, incarcerated people will pay nothing for calls and the Sheriff's Office will seek to maximize phone access as much as possible across all jails. For the City, the contract is also a good deal. Overall, San Francisco taxpayers will pay less for jail communications than incarcerated families previously paid to the phone provider.
""As a City we should invest in the most marginalized populations in our city, not profit off of them,"" said Treasurer José Cisneros. ""During the health pandemic it's more important than ever that families be able to connect with their incarcerated loved ones. These reforms reflect our values as San Franciscans. I hope other counties take a hard look at them and commit to do the same. I am proud that our Financial Justice Project worked with the Sheriff, Mayor, and community advocates to bring these reforms to fruition.""
""San Francisco's new jail phone contract is an innovative breakthrough for the prison phone justice movement that protects incarcerated people, their families, and all taxpayers from exploitation at the hands of the predatory prison telecom industry,"" said Bianca Tylek, Executive Director of Worth Rises. ""All prison and jail administrators should consider adopting a similar contract.""
In July 2020, the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of the People Over Profits ordinance authored by Supervisor Fewer. People Over Profits permanently bans the City from profiting off jail inmates and their families via services such as phone calls and commissary items, and ensures the City cannot generate revenue through other services such as video calls and access to computer tablets.
California Senate Bill 555 (D-Holly Mitchell, Los Angeles) would dramatically reduce jail phone call rates and eliminate commissary markups statewide. The bill is being heard in the California Assembly's Appropriations Committee on Friday, August 14.
Previously, high phone call costs and an average county markup of 43% on items from the jail commissary placed an economic burden on incarcerated people and their families. Prior to these reforms, if an incarcerated person made two 15-minute phone calls a day in San Francisco, it would cost $300 over 70 days, which is the average jail stay, or $1,500 over the course of the year.
Analysis done by the San Francisco Financial Justice Project in the Office of Treasurer José Cisneros estimates that 80% of phone calls were paid for by incarcerated individuals' support networks, primarily low-income women of color. In a national survey of incarcerated people and their families, the cost of phone calls was identified as the primary barrier to staying in contact with loved ones in prison or jail. Studies show that people who maintain contact with their families while incarcerated are more likely to succeed after they are released and have lower recidivism rates. According to the Vera Institute, the majority of people who exit the criminal justice system end up residing with a relative or spouse after their release, and staying connected with family while incarcerated helps maintain these important relationships.
In addition to implementing free jail calls, in April 2020, the Sheriff's Office eliminated commission or profit in the jail commissary (jail store) and prices dropped an average of 43%. Specific price reductions include:
""As a formerly incarcerated woman, I often had to choose between whether I could afford a phone call home that month or whether I wouldn't call and make sure that my family had enough to pay the bills while taking care of my children,"" said Amika Mota, Policy Director, Young Women's Freedom Center. ""This is a huge win for San Francisco.""
""Free phone calls will make a huge difference for incarcerated people and their family members who are supporting them,"" said Valentina Sedeno, Re-Entry Services Program Manager, Young Community Developers. ""The higher the price of each call, the more difficult it is for incarcerated people to stay in touch with their circles of support—which are their lifelines and who they rely on and need to be in contact with to develop their plans of release and successfully transition back into the community. It is often close family members who typically are low-income, women of color, such as mothers, sisters, and partners, that tend to take on the financial responsibility by putting money on prepaid phone accounts to stay in touch with their loved ones. The costs add up quickly and often become unaffordable to sustain, so free calls will really help.""
This reform builds on other efforts in San Francisco to assess and reform fines and fees that disproportionately affect low-income people and communities of color. In 2018, San Francisco became the first county in the nation to eliminate administrative fees across multiple City agencies that are charged to people exiting the criminal justice system. The City and County ultimately wrote off $32 million in debt that was owed by 21,000 people, since the fees were charged almost exclusively to low-income people who could not pay them. These fees created barriers to people's re-entry and also had very low collection rates.

53,/california/san-francisco/fallacy-behind-private-surveillance-cameras-san-francisco-opinion,2020-08-10T13:57:43Z,The Fallacy Behind Private Surveillance Cameras...,0,0,CalMatters,News Partner,"From CalMatters:
In summary
San Francisco tightly restricts video surveillance by its police, but a millionaire has created an unaccountable neighborhood surveillance system.

Recently The New York Times published an article about a San Francisco tech executive named Chris Larsen and his efforts to fund a private network of surveillance cameras around the city.
Since 2012 Larsen has spent nearly $4 million of his own money installing more than 1,000 cameras blanketing 135 city blocks. Larsen's partners in this effort are the city's Community Benefit Districts with whom he works to install cameras on private property and control access to footage.
Why fund this multimillion-dollar network of surveillance cameras capable of picking out the dimples on a person's face and tracking individuals over several blocks? Larsen claims his motivation is his frustration with San Francisco's plague of property crime, specifically auto break-ins.
According to Larsen, the solution is ""pure coverage"": specifically ""full city camera coverage, so police can play a smaller, more subtle role. Individual vigilantism will not work, he argued, but strong neighborhoods with continuous video feeds on every corner will.""
Multiple research studies suggest that ""pure coverage"" of surveillance cameras does not end crime. Ironically, property crimes, specifically auto theft (of and from vehicles) is one type of crime that surveillance has been demonstrated to curtail, but – as a 2008 study of San Francisco's police-controlled surveillance cameras showed – only in precisely targeted, contextually specific applications.
The notion that carpeting a city with cameras will prevent crime is a fiction, even if there are real-time and immediate consequences to being caught on camera. In short, without enabling a police state, ubiquitous cameras are not the answer.
And as to the ""more subtle role"" played by police that Larsen envisions, recent reporting by the Electronic Frontier Foundation reveals that to be a fiction as well. According to records obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, San Francisco Police ""conducted mass surveillance of protesters at the end of May and in early June using a downtown business district's camera network.""
By circumventing the Big Brother of law enforcement, Larsen is enabling the creation of a network of Little Brothers that is presently unaccountable and disproportionate to the problem at hand, especially given that San Francisco police have concluded that the actual number of perpetrators of these crimes is quite small.
The myriad factors involved in crime make identifying a single variable responsible for its reduction extremely difficult. What is inarguable is that shifting responsibility for monitoring public spaces from law enforcement to citizens rarely addresses the disproportionate impacts of surveillance on marginalized communities.
As journalist Lauren Smiley eloquently explained in The Atlantic last year in her investigation of the response of some Potrero Hill residents to a local package thief, ""while porch cams have been used to investigate cases as serious as homicides, the surveillance and neighborhood social networking typically make a particular type of crime especially visible: those lower-level ones happening out in public, committed by the poorest.""
Technologically enhanced private surveillance also enables a form of community vigilantism when individuals with no training, no oversight and no legal culpability are given the ability to surveil the public at will. We've already witnessed how neighborhoods armed with Ring cameras and similar technologies share footage widely online, often engaging in racial profiling, misidentification or generalized susupicion of ""strangers,"" often Black or brown, who are merely going about their lives.
Much of Larsen's investment has been in the city's wealthiest or gentrifying neighborhoods, which raises questions about how redistributing his $4 million investment might have chipped away at this problem from a different angle, especially considering that in San Francisco, an individual earning under $82,000 a year is considered low-income.
In this instance, Community Benefit Districts serve as a convenient vehicle for purportedly representing the views of neighborhoods. Who they speak for, however, and what purpose they serve, is open to debate. A 2018 UC Berkeley study of Community Benefit Districts in California found that they ""use their power and resources to advocate for anti-homeless policies and to support policing practices that exclude or drive out homeless people."" The Berkeley study raises important questions as to whether Community Benefit Districts are the appropriate entity to wield the power of such sophisticated surveillance tools.
We don't contest the seriousness and frustration of these crimes. But in a city that has some of the tightest restrictions on video surveillance and face recognition technology by its police, and prides itself on its respect for diversity and civil rights, there is no irony in witnessing private interests, particularly technology millionaires, that disrupt public checks and balances to create an unaccountable surveillance system.

August 07, 2020
Twelve organizations awarded funding to protect and expand opportunities for youth in affordable housing and the foster system; provide multilingual support to domestic violence survivors; introduce women, girls and gender nonconforming individuals to creative industry careers; and legal services
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development, the San Francisco Arts Commission, and Community Vision today announced $3.1 million in transformative awards for nonprofit space acquisition and lease stabilization, including $2.15 million in vital support for Latino-led organizations expanding their space and services at new affordable housing sites in the Mission District. The grants are part of San Francisco's Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative (NSI), which deploys financial assistance, professional services, assessment tools and other resources to help stabilize nonprofits, and are vital to providing and supporting residents including low-income families and children with social and mental health services as part of the response to COVID-19 and beyond.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the Mission District and our Latino community, but we know the factors that led to this disparity existed long before this health emergency,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We need to ensure that the organizations serving the community have what they need to continue their work, while also continuing our progress to build more affordable housing and create more community-serving spaces in the neighborhood.""
With increasing and diverse demands for government services, San Francisco has nearly 7,000 nonprofits that often work in partnership with the City to address complex challenges and the needs of residents. Administered by OEWD, the NSI continues San Francisco's groundbreaking support of nonprofit space and sustainability, and investments in resilience that assist nonprofits and prevent displacement. The underlying objective of all NSI programs is to ensure access to quality of life resources as well as education, health, and human services for residents of San Francisco, and real estate assistance is a cornerstone of the program.
In addition to the awarded grants, the Mayor's proposed budget includes $2.8 million for Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative real estate assistance in Fiscal Year 2020-21. Should funding be approved by the Board of Supervisors, the next round of applications for real estate acquisition and space stabilization will open in late 2020. Grants are administered by Community Vision, which will offer several workshops with more information. Past program guidelines are available at communityvisionca.org/sfsustainability. Information about past NSI awardees and current resources can be found at oewd.org/nonprofits.
""The organizations that are being supported through these Nonprofit Sustainability grants are essential anchors sustaining the life and culture of the Mission. With so much hardship hitting my district, I am relieved that we were able to protect these funds and invest it strategically to help our community recover and thrive,"" said Supervisor Hillary Ronen.
""San Francisco's nonprofits are a powerful economic engine,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Beyond providing essential services, resources and vitality to our communities, nonprofits helped restart our economy after the last recession, generating early job growth and attracting over $1.5 billion dollars annually in regional and national philanthropy. They are vital to our recovery and we are committed to working with them now, particularly those advancing shared and equitable prosperity, to hold ground and stay focused on their missions.""
Spaces supported by NSI funds will protect and expand opportunities for youth in affordable housing and the foster system; provide multilingual support to domestic violence survivors; introduce women, girls and gender nonconforming individuals to creative industry careers; and provide essential legal services. This funding will be instrumental in stabilizing 55,763 square feet of nonprofit space for an average of 15.6 years, for organizations annually serving 105,069 beneficiaries.
""It is so invigorating that our Mayor London Breed and our supervisor Hillary Ronen were able to support our campaign to keep our vibrant, effective and groundbreaking organizations at the center of the Mission's cultural community,"" said Artistic Director Krissy Keefer of Dance Mission Theater and the socially charged Dance Brigade.
""West Bay has been serving San Francisco's most vulnerable populations for the past 50 years, primarily focusing on recent Filipino immigrant youth, seniors and their families in SoMa, and has never owned its own space,"" said Carla Laurel, executive director of West Bay Pilipino Multi Service Center. ""Now more than ever, owning our space and expanding means that we can answer the pressing needs of our community by providing in-person academic, social and emotional support to kids who live in small apartments and SRO's and by supporting their parents, many of whom are essential workers, to go back to work.""
""COVID-19 is hitting our communities the hardest, exposing the inequalities in our education, healthcare, and economic systems. This innovative co-location with First Exposures and our partnership with MEDA allows us to continue serving the Mission community when we need to leverage collective resources the most,"" said Youth Speaks Executive Director Cristy Johnston Limon.

The suits, both filed in Alameda County Superior Court, claim that classifying drivers as independent contractors violates state labor laws and denies drivers basic workplace protections such as paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, minimum wages and overtime pay.
Neither company responded to requests for comment Thursday evening.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued Uber and Lyft in San Francisco Superior Court in May, also accusing them of illegally classifying their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.
Since January, under Assembly Bill 5, California law has required that companies determine whether their workers are employees or independent contractors based on a three-part assessment: whether the workers are directed by the company, whether their work is the same as what the company normally does and whether it is the worker's usual work.
Uber, Lyft and other ""gig economy"" companies have opposed the law, saying their workers prefer having the freedom to work flexible hours without the commitments required of employees.
The labor commissioner's lawsuit seeks to recover wages for the more than 100,000 estimated people who drive for the two companies.
""The Uber and Lyft business model rests on the misclassification of drivers as independent contractors,"" California Labor Commissioner Lilia Garcia-Brower said in a statement. ""This leaves workers without protections such as paid sick leave and reimbursement of drivers' expenses, as well as overtime and minimum wages.""
The Labor Commissioner's Office said it has received claims from 5,000 drivers for owed wages.

San Francisco further extends the deadline for businesses to file and pay their Business Registration Fee and Unified License Fees until March 2021
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Treasurer José Cisneros today announced the City will continue to defer collection of Business Registration Fees and the Unified License Fees until March 1, 2021. Unified License Fees include charges from City departments to restaurants and food businesses, bars, convenience stores, many small retailers, hotels, tour operators, and other businesses. The previously announced deferral on business taxes for small businesses and additional supports for small businesses remain in place.
""Businesses in San Francisco continue to struggle with a loss of revenue and unfortunately we know that the COVID-19 pandemic isn't going away any time soon,"" said Mayor Breed. ""When we initially issued the deferral of these fees, we were optimistic the situation would improve and businesses would be in a better financial position, but the lack of a coordinated federal response to the pandemic has only exacerbated the situation. Continuing to defer the collection of these fees will provide some relief for business as we keep working with them to help them stay afloat and take care of their employees.""
""I've heard from many businesses that were concerned about paying these bills by September 30th. I am hopeful that further delaying collections of the business registration and license fees will provide some needed relief,"" said Treasurer José Cisneros. ""We will continue to work with businesses to find ways to lessen the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The measures Mayor Breed and Treasurer Cisneros announced today are the following:
Deferral of Business Registration Fee
The City will extend the 2020-2021 Business Registration Fee deadline to March 1, 2021. Business Registration Certificates issued for 2019-2020 will remain valid through March 1, 2021. In April 2020, Mayor Breed and Treasurer Cisneros announced an extension of the deadline to September 30, 2020 instead of May 31, 2020. Given that the situation with COVID-19 continues to be challenging for the City's businesses, the City has decided to further extend the deadline.
Mayor Breed will be working with Treasurer Cisneros to notify businesses that they now have five additional months to file and pay the Business Registration Fee. Every business in San Francisco has to renew their registration annually. There are currently 93,000 registered businesses who pay nearly $49 million in Business Registration Fees.
Deferral of Business Licensing Fees
The City will provide regulatory fee relief for businesses by further delaying the City's collection of the Unified License Fees until March 1, 2021. The Unified License Fees include, but are not limited to, charges to restaurants and food businesses, bars, convenience stores, many small retailers, hotels, and tour operators, from departments such as the Department of Public Health, Entertainment Commission, Fire Department, and Police Department. This impacts nearly $14 million billed to 11,000 businesses. In March, Mayor Breed announced an initial delay for the collection of the fee and in April further extended the deadline to September 30, 2020.
Mayor Breed's other initiatives to support small business include:

Paid internship program, created in partnership with the Mayor's Office, Public Defender's Office, Human Rights Commission, and Teachers 4 Social Justice, provides 25 public high school students with a 40-week experience to learn about the criminal legal system and public defense
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Public Defender Mano Raju today announced the creation of the San Francisco Young Defenders Program, a paid educational internship program to provide employment and mentorship opportunities to 25 local public high school students around criminal justice issues. The Young Defenders Program is part of the Opportunities for All initiative, which Mayor Breed created in 2018 to connect young people of all backgrounds to paid employment, job training, and mentorship opportunities.
The Young Defenders Program seeks to invest equitably in youth empowerment rather than the criminalization of youth, and ensure that youth of color have the opportunity to achieve a more successful future for themselves, their families, and their community. The program is the result of a unique partnership between Mayor Breed's Opportunities for All initiative, the Public Defender's Office, the Human Rights Commission, the San Francisco Unified School District, and Teachers 4 Social Justice. The internship program started last week with orientation, and the interns begin their placements with the Public Defender's Office today.
""I know firsthand how an internship can change the course of a young person's life,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We created Opportunities for All to empower youth and give them a chance to learn new skills and build professional connections, while also getting paid for their time. When we focus on providing opportunities for all of our young people, those youth go above and beyond to prove themselves and then succeed in ways they and others never imagined. This program invests in communities that have historically been left behind and opens up opportunities that otherwise would have been out of reach. I want to thank all the partners who have worked to make the Young Defenders program a reality, especially at a time when it's more important than ever that we're making concrete investments in supporting communities of color.""
""I am proud that we are launching the Young Defenders Program at this moment in time, as the movement for Black Lives Matter continues to build momentum across the country, and young people are calling for racial justice and changes to the laws and practices that directly affect their lives,"" said Mano Raju, Public Defender of San Francisco. ""Through this program we have an opportunity to train and educate young San Franciscans on how the criminal legal system works and how public defenders advocate for people through every step of the process. My hope is we can start to build a new pipeline of diverse Public Defenders and criminal justice advocates through this program.""
The San Francisco Public Defender's Office is lauded as one of the premier public defender offices in the country, with a deep commitment to community engagement and achieving structural reforms to the criminal legal system locally and statewide. The Young Defenders Program is in line with the Public Defender's commitment to close the school to prison pipeline, as evidenced by its community-based M.A.G.I.C. programs which connect youth and families to opportunities and resources in the Bayview and the Fillmore-Western Addition neighborhoods. The Young Defenders Program is an opportunity to further guide and empower young San Franciscans through direct mentorship.
Over the course of 40 weeks, Young Defenders will hear lectures from guest speakers, be paired with defense attorneys and social workers to complete weekly assignments, participate in group projects such as mock trials, and develop virtual community outreach events on topics such as knowing your rights, increasing the diversity of juries, and facilitating restorative justice. Many will also earn academic credit toward high school graduation while earning minimum wage for up to 15 hours a week. Due to COVID-19, students will participate in the program remotely for the time being, and will be provided the technology they need for remote work.
The first group of Young Defenders were selected for the program through an interest survey following their summer internship with Opportunities for All. Opportunities for All and the Mayor's Office will fund the youth stipends, and the Public Defender's Office will fund the program through staff time and service hours. As many families are struggling financially due to COVID-19, it is more important than ever that students have access to paid internship opportunities.
""The purpose of this program is to expose students to the world of criminal justice from the perspective of the Public Defender's Office while inspiring students to use their own power as educators and activists for change,"" said Athena Edwards, Senior Fellow, Opportunities for All.
""I like that this cohort is teaching me things that I need to know about the law and my rights,"" said Aniyah, a San Francisco native and rising junior at Raoul Wallenberg High School. ""I also like my Fellows. They're very creative in leading our activities and our group conversations and even though these things can be tricky, it's fun trying new things. I enjoy being a part of this cohort and getting to experience different job techniques, while doing activities outside of my comfort zone.""
""It's a good opportunity for me to learn about criminal justice,"" said Shamira, a San Francisco native and rising sophomore at KIPP San Francisco College Prep. ""Last week in orientation, we did our first presentation. My partner and I focused on Breonna Taylor, and how the police who killed her have not been arrested. We learned a lot about laws, but also used our own knowledge and understanding for the presentation.""
""I'm excited to be starting my second year interning with Opportunities for All,"" said India Brar, a student joining the Young Defenders program. ""I am extremely passionate about helping people especially ones in need and believe that being placed with San Francisco's Young Defenders program was not only more than I could've asked for, but will allow me to make a difference which is something I am looking forward to.""
Since taking office, Mayor Breed has consistently prioritized funding for programs that make San Francisco more equitable. As announced on Friday, the Mayor's budget continues to prioritize equity, with funding both from the General Fund and redirected from the City's law enforcement departments. Mayor Breed has proposed using funding to reinvest in the African American community and to repair the legacy of racially disparate policies on health, housing, and economic outcomes for African Americans in San Francisco.
In addition to redirecting funding from law enforcement departments, the Mayor's budget includes ongoing and new investments from the General Fund to support vulnerable populations throughout San Francisco, prioritizing several children- and youth-focused initiatives that will ensure more equitable outcomes for future generations of San Franciscans. Specifically, the Mayor's proposed budget for Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 includes $5.5 million in funding from the General Fund to continue the Opportunities for All program.
""I am grateful for the ability to connect Opportunities for All with Teachers 4 Social Justice and the Public Defender's office to launch this program,"" said Sheryl Davis, Executive Director, Human Rights Commission. ""Opportunities for All provides young people with the opportunity to not just develop skills and build their social networks, but programs like the Young Defenders, centers youth voice, encourages and empowers youth to address issues of inequity, to transform systems and challenge business as usual. I look forward to learning from the youth and seeing the impact they will have in the community and the criminal justice system.""
""This is the City, the School District and community based organizations working together to do the most for young people, especially during this time,"" said Jeremiah Jeffries, public school teacher and coordinator for Teachers 4 Social Justice. ""SF Young Defenders is a concrete example of where we should be reallocating funding to, away from policing and criminalization of youth, toward education and giving youth a foundation to build careers focused toward justice.""
""In my role as Board of Education Commissioner and Education Advisor to the Mayor, the creation of SF Young Defenders is the fulfillment of one of the many promises we asked the public to trust us to fulfill,"" said Jenny Lam, Commissioner, San Francisco Board of Education. ""The potential I see in these young people and in this opportunity is why cross institution and community partnerships can be so powerful and should be the rule not the exception for how to get things done for young people.""
In October 2018, Mayor Breed announced the launch of Opportunities for All (OFA), a program to address economic inequality by ensuring that all young people can be a part of San Francisco's thriving economy and explore different career paths. In the first full summer of the OFA program in 2019, there were more than 3,800 total placements, including at least 1,500 new placements.
To date, the summer 2020 OFA cohort has placed over 1,400 youth in internships. Additionally, 68 Opportunities for All Fellows and 12 Senior Fellows were placed. Fellows are college aged young adults who work directly with high school students, creating project design, and developing their projects and presentations. OFA introduced the Senior Fellow position this year, 12 upper-class college students, and postgraduates, who each managed a small group of Fellows, offering daily, direct engagement, facilitating meetings, and supporting the project design for their cohorts.

San Francisco Public Library cardholders can soon start to pick up materials at the front doors of select library locations
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and City Librarian Michael Lambert today announced the launch of SFPL To Go, which will enable San Francisco Public Library cardholders to pick up and return their materials at select library locations throughout the City. The new program will roll out in phases with the first locations opening at the Main Library on Monday, August 10th and at the Excelsior Branch on Tuesday, August 11th.
""The San Francisco Public Library has significantly increased digital access to its collection during the COVID-19 health emergency, but I know that for many of us nothing replaces the feeling of holding and reading a physical book,"" says Mayor Breed. ""The launch of SFPL To Go will allow for pick-up and drop-off in a safe and convenient way, and will help provide greater access to resources for our youth who will need extra support to ensure that this academic year is a success. I want to recognize Library staff for their tremendous contributions to the City's COVID-19 response efforts, from contact tracing to food distribution and community outreach, along with their continued commitment to keeping our Library operating and accessible to all our residents.""
On July 9th, the San Francisco Public Library Commission endorsed a plan for SFPL To Go, the Library's version of curbside pick-up. Over the coming weeks, the Library will open more SFPL To Go locations at Mission Bay, Eureka Valley, Merced, and Marina branches. Additional neighborhood libraries will offer the service as staffing capacity allows. Almost half of the Library's staff are currently deployed as Disaster Service Workers.
Each location will operate under a City-approved Health and Safety Plan and will follow all masking and social distancing requirements and OCLC and Institute of Museum and Library Services' strict guidelines for materials handling.
""Books are back!"" says City Librarian Michael Lambert. ""We are thrilled to launch SFPL To Go and to see all of our patrons again at our front doors. We thank everyone for their patience as we implement contact-free service throughout the City. As we look ahead, Library staff will continually reevaluate our operations and develop safety protocols for the next phases of service.""
Library patrons can request a book, DVD, audiobook, LP or any circulating library item for front door pick-up by going to sfpl.org and placing a hold through their library account; by emailing info@sfpl.org or by calling 415-557-4400. Once the item is ready, patrons will receive a notice for retrieval. Book drops will be open only at SFPL To Go locations during operating hours.
All patrons are encouraged to release any holds they may no longer want by August 7th, so that staff can focus on fulfilling current requests. Materials checked out pre-closure are not due until September 30th. As SFPL is Fabulously Fine Free, there are no late fees. For more information, visit sfpl.org/sfpl-to-go.

San Francisco will implement a 4-block temporary project on Jones Street, while rolling out Shared Spaces and Play Streets for pedestrian space in the Tenderloin for maintaining physical distance
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Supervisor Matt Haney today announced the creation of new pedestrian spaces to support residents and businesses in the Tenderloin, which has been especially hard-hit by COVID-19. The City will temporarily refashion San Francisco streets, including the implementation of sidewalk expansions, the Play Streets program, and the Shared Spaces program. In the coming days, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) will implement a 4-block temporary project on Jones Street, from O'Farrell Street to Golden Gate Avenue for residents to have more pedestrian space in the Tenderloin while maintaining physical distance.
""We know that it's been difficult for people to maintain physical distance on sidewalks when going out for essential outings in the Tenderloin, and these changes will make it easier for people to get around their neighborhood safely,"" said Mayor Breed. ""COVID-19 has also made it difficult for our businesses, and thanks to our Shared Spaces Program, more restaurants in the Tenderloin will be able to use outdoor space to operate, which will support the economic and physical health of our entire community.""
""The Tenderloin not only deserves but desperately needs streets that are re-designed to meet the needs of the residents, essential workers, businesses, families, and seniors,"" said Supervisor Haney. ""With the critical guidance of the Tenderloin Traffic Safety Taskforce and many other stakeholders, I'm excited that this set of projects is being implemented.""
The Tenderloin is a dense neighborhood with a high percentage of low-income residents, people of color, seniors, and transit-dependent San Franciscans who need more space for physical distancing and making essential trips. With support from Mayor Breed and Supervisor Matt Haney, the SFMTA will implement the following efforts in the Tenderloin to address community needs starting next week:
From the beginning of the City's COVID-19 response, the SFMTA has supported the Tenderloin community through changes such as a parking lane closure at the pop-up test site on Ellis Street, daytime street closure in front of St. Anthony's at the 100 block of Golden Gate, and a parking lane removal for more pedestrian-queuing space at GLIDE on the 300 block of Ellis. The City and SFMTA will continue to support additional community needs, such as curb changes needed to support testing sites and food pantries, both the short-term and into the future.
""The Tenderloin has San Francisco's highest concentration of vulnerable residents and highest concentration of traffic crashes. It also has the highest rate of emergency service calls. The street safety and design approaches that work in other neighborhoods did not work in the Tenderloin"" said Jeffrey Tumlin, SFMTA Director of Transportation. ""We're grateful to the creativity of community-based organizations, the Fire Department, and other partners for helping us find creative solutions that work for the unique needs of Tenderloin residents.""
Several Tenderloin community groups have been important partners with the City and SFMTA in the effort to create these programs. These groups include the Central City SRO Collaborative, Tenderloin Community Benefit District, Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, and the Tenderloin People's Congress.
""We're happy the Jones project has gone forward, but it is only just the beginning of broader shift towards a more equitable future that puts the Tenderloin's residents — not car traffic — first,"" said Evan Oravec, co-chair of the Tenderloin Traffic Safety Taskforce.

Mayor Breed's two-year budget proposal makes critical investments while also balancing a significant budget deficit
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced her budget proposal for Fiscal Years (FY) 2020-21 and 2021-22, which includes new investments to prioritize racial equity and reinvest in the African-American community, continue making progress on homelessness and behavioral health, and maintain the City's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The budget proposal makes these important investments while also balancing the two-year $1.5 billion deficit with a responsible use of reserves, preserving jobs and with minimal impact to City services.
The annual $13.7 billion budget for FY 2020-21 and $12.6 billion budget for FY 2021-22 is the culmination of months of collaborative work with elected officials, City departments, and community organizations, which was made challenging this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed budget for FY 2020-21 is higher than the budget for FY 2019-20 primarily due to one-time expenditures to respond to COVID-19, and which go away in the second year of the budget. Public outreach on the budget was done virtually in response to the COVID-19 emergency.
""This budget closes our $1.5 billion deficit while still making critical investments in the most pressing issues facing San Francisco,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This time last year, we did not expect that we'd have to respond to a public health emergency like COVID-19, but we have risen to the occasion and are directing significant City resources to keep San Franciscans safe and healthy. We are listening to the African American community, which has for too long been unheard and underserved, and redirecting investments to close the disparities that we continue to see to this day. And we're keeping our focus on helping people who are homeless get off the streets and into shelter, providing mental health and substance use treatment, and ensuring that we can continue providing essential City services for all our residents.""
Mayor Breed's proposed budget does not include any layoffs of permanent City staff, maintains City services with minimal impacts, and closes the approximately $1.5 billion General Fund deficit through a combination of revenue and expenditure solutions. However, the Mayor's budget as currently proposed is contingent in part upon revenue from the consensus Business Tax Reform measure, which will be on the November 2020 ballot. Additionally, the budget assumes that the City and its labor unions will reach an agreement to defer scheduled wage increases over the two-year budget period.
Redirecting Funding to the African American Community and Prioritizing Equity
The Mayor's proposed budget acknowledges the structural inequities impacting the city's African American community, resulting from generations of disinvestment. The proposed budget reinvests $120 million in funds over two years, predominately from the City's law enforcement departments, towards efforts to repair the legacy of racially disparate policies on health, housing, and economic outcomes for African Americans. The proposed budget also includes $15 million in one-time funding for the San Francisco Unified School District to support San Francisco's public school students most disparately impacted by COVID-19 and the resulting school closures. The budget further includes additional General Fund investments in programs for San Francisco youth.
On Monday, July 27, Mayor Breed and Supervisor Shamann Walton released a report from the Human Rights Commission that summarizes the findings of initial community engagement and provides a framework for ongoing conversations and decisions to reinvest in San Francisco's Black community. The report highlights recommendations, research and data raised through the community input process to prioritize resources to the African American community.
Mayor Breed's budget is informed by that process and recognizes that the African American community must continue to be involved in determining the specific allocations of the funding. Therefore, the Human Rights Commission will continue leading a community process to determine how the $120 million will be allocated. Based on the initial input from the community, Mayor Breed has proposed that 60% of the funding be directed for mental health, wellness, and homelessness, and 35% be directed to education, youth development, and economic opportunity. The disbursement of funds will be discussed, tracked, and evaluated on an ongoing basis through the Human Rights Commissions' continuing process of community engagement.
The remainder of the redirected law enforcement funds in the Mayor's proposed budget will be allocated for a thorough planning process in FY 2020-21 to divert non-emergency, low priority calls for service away from the Police Department to non-law enforcement agencies.
The Mayor's proposed budget also invests a total of $12.5 million to extend stipend programs for SFUSD teachers in high turnover schools and for educators in the City's early care and education system. Mayor Breed's budget adds $5.5 million over the two years to extend the Opportunities for All (OFA) pilot, a youth internship program initiated in last year's budget. Lastly, the Mayor's proposed budget allocates another $4 million over two years to be distributed by the Office of Racial Equity within the Human Rights Commission, to maintain and prioritize ongoing community involvement and responsive programming.
Homelessness and Mental Health
To continue to address the homelessness crisis and help people suffering from mental illness and substance use disorders, Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes funding to maintain investments in behavioral health beds, rental assistance and subsidy programs, and other critical mental health and homelessness programming. The proposed budget also makes new investments to pilot a new crisis response model and seeds funding for the Office of Coordinated Care in the Department of Public Health.
Homelessness
Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes a number of critical investments in homelessness, to be largely funded by the passage of the November 2020 Business Tax Reform measure, which would unlock new revenue from the November 2018 Proposition C measure. This funding will be used in part to implement the City's Homelessness Recovery Plan, which Mayor Breed announced earlier this month. Through the Homeless Recovery Plan, the City will continue emergency homelessness response initiatives in the short-term and make 6,000 placements available over the next two years for people experiencing homelessness.
The proposed budget funds a historic investment in the City's permanent supportive housing portfolio; in addition to enabling the City to newly lease or acquire 1,500 permanent supportive housing units through the Homelessness Recovery Plan, the budget funds a significant expansion of newly constructed permanent supportive housing units through the City's Local Operating Subsidy Program and the 833 Bryant project. Additionally, the budget adds $6.6 million in funding to continue emergency shelter and eviction prevention pilot programs.
Mental Health
The Mayor's proposed budget supports the implementation of the first phase of Mental Health SF, a comprehensive overhaul of San Francisco's mental health system. Notably, the budget will fund the creation of an Office of Coordinated Care within the Department of Public Health, pilot a non-law enforcement Crisis Response Team for engaging people on the street experiencing mental health or substance use-related crises, and increase the City's capacity for mental health and substance use treatment beds.
These investments would be supported by approximately $66.5 million over two years, should the Business Tax Reform measure pass in November. Mayor Breed's budget includes $5 million from the General Fund to accelerate the implementation of the Office of Coordinated Care and the Crisis Response Team, so that work can begin regardless of the outcome of the November 2020 ballot measure.
COVID-19 Ongoing Response and Recovery
Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes funding to ensure the City is able to continue its comprehensive, data-driven, and public health-focused response to the ongoing health threats and economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, the Mayor's proposed budget allocates $446.1 million to ensure the City has the financial resources to meet the citywide priorities set forth by the COVID-19 Command Center, the centralized emergency operations center coordinating the response across City departments. The Mayor's budget assumes the City's General Fund will support $93 million of that total amount, and that the remaining amount will be covered through a combination of FEMA reimbursement and funding from the CARES Act.
This funding will be directed to three main categories: health and human services; housing and shelter; and emergency communications and coordination. The Mayor's budget ensures there is adequate funding for COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment, expanded capacity at hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, outbreak management, and contact tracing, among other expenses. Throughout COVID-19, addressing food insecurity has remained one of Mayor Breed's and the City's top priorities. The Mayor's proposed budget includes $45.7 million in new expenditures for food programs. Lastly, the budget includes investments to address the needs of San Francisco's unsheltered residents in the COVID-19 environment with shelter, food, and medical care.
Community based organizations have been an integral part of the City's ongoing response to COVID-19. Mayor Breed's proposed budget includes funding to ensure that community partners can continue to work with the City to provide community-based and multi-lingual outreach and education during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Budget Timeline
In order to allow the City to be responsive to the COVID-19 emergency and to ensure sufficient time to understand the full economic impacts, the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors agreed to an updated schedule for the FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 budget process which extended the process by two months. After originally releasing budget instructions for the upcoming two-year budget in December 2019, the Mayor reissued instructions to departments in May 2020 to reflect the revised budget shortfall. Departments were instructed to submit new budget proposals to aid the Mayor in developing a balanced budget in June and July.
Following Mayor Breed's introduction of the proposed budget, it will now go to the Budget and Finance Committee and the full Board of Supervisors, after which it will go to the Mayor for her signature and final adoption by October 1, 2020

61,/california/san-francisco/mayor-unveils-budget-african-american-community-investments,2020-07-31T22:39:25Z,Mayor Unveils Budget With African American...,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA – San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Friday unveiled a proposed city budget that includes investments in the city's African American community and funding for the city's continued COVID-19 response.
With a budget of $13.7 billion for the fiscal year 2020-2021 and $12.6 billion for 2021-2022, the two-year budget aims to close a $1.5 billion deficit with the use of reserves, while preserving jobs and making minimal cuts to city services.
Although the city has avoided lay-offs since the pandemic began, Breed said her proposed budget aims to continue that, but it depends on unions for city workers agreeing to delay any planned wage increases for the next two years.
Breed said that so far, talks with police and firefighters' unions have been successful in agreeing to delay wage increases.
""I'm hoping other unions will agree to do the same. I don't think this is too much to ask. Our entire city is suffering now and we all need to do our part to share in that sacrifice,"" she said. ""If the unions don't agree to delay their raises, then we will be forced to lay people off. We will be
forced to cut city services.""
The budget also proposes $120 million be reinvested from law enforcement toward efforts to uplift the city's African American residents.
""As a Black woman who grew up in poverty in this city, police brutality was all too common. It was something we expected and our complaints were usually ignored. Two months ago, the murder of George Floyd shook this country to this core, in a way that I have never seen before,"" she said.
""With this budget, we are listening to the community and prioritizing investments in the African American around housing, mental health and wellness, workforce development, economic justice, education, advocacy and accountability.""
Of the $120 million, Breed is proposing at least 60 percent be dedicated toward mental health, and 35 percent be put toward youth development, education and economic opportunities.
Breed's budget also proposes allocating $446.1 million to the city's COVID-19 response efforts, with focuses on health services, housing and shelter, and emergency communications.
Of that amount, the budget assumes the city can support $93 million, while the remaining amount can be covered by U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements and funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.
Breed's budget also addresses mental health and homelessness, highlighting the city's Homelessness Recovery Plan, which aims to provide some 6,000 homeless people with continued shelter after they've been placed in hotels, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Several of the investments in mental health and homelessness rely on $66.5 million over the two years from the Business Tax Reform measure passing during the citywide election in November.
Breed also announced earlier this week, the budget includes $15 million to support San Francisco Unified School District, students and families as the fall semester is set to begin with distance learning.
Once approved by the city's Budget and Finance Committee and the full Board of Supervisors, Breed is expected to sing the final budget on Oct.

July 29, 2020
San Francisco will help close School District funding gap while continuing to invest in programs to support children, families, and teachers affected by the move to distance learning resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced $15 million in new funding will support the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) in order to help alleviate the financial burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding will be included as part of the Fiscal Years (FY) 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 budget, which Mayor Breed will announce this Friday.
The funding is another effort from Mayor Breed to support students, families, and teachers as they navigate the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming school year and adapt to changes such as distance learning. SFUSD currently faces a budget shortfall of $22 million largely due to a decrease in revenues from the pandemic and would otherwise face potential cuts to staffing and critical training without this additional funding.
""One of the most frustrating aspects of the failure of national leadership to contain COVID-19 is that students are facing another year of education without the ability to be in the classroom, parents are facing another year without the childcare provided by schools, and teachers are facing another year of uncertainty due to the looming budget deficits,"" said Mayor Breed. ""The City is stepping in to help the school district through this challenging time because we need to do everything we can to ensure that our students don't fall further behind during these uncertain times. Whether it's this additional funding, continuing to provide daily meals for students who no longer have access to school lunches, or creating learning hubs for up to 6,000 disadvantaged students, we're trying to provide as much assistance as possible.""
""We greatly appreciate this budgetary support from Mayor Breed, which will provide much needed fiscal relief as our school community ramps up for a challenging year,"" said Superintendent Vincent Matthews. ""The pandemic has required significant additional costs and reduced local revenues, and this assistance will help us focus on supporting students and families instead of decimating our budgets further at the worst possible time.""
The $15 million in funding will come from the City's General Fund in the Mayor's proposed budget. Following the announcement from SFUSD earlier this month that the school year will begin with distance learning, Mayor Breed and the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) announced that San Francisco will transform facilities around the city into supervised Community Learning Hubs to support distance learning for high students starting this fall. Additionally, the City will extend its emergency child and youth care program to support families during COVID-19, to serve the children of healthcare workers and City employees serving as Disaster Service Workers.
Even prior to the pandemic, SFUSD faced significant budget challenges due to expenses steadily increasing more quickly than revenues over multiple years. The District took steps this past spring to address a mid-year deficit as well as a $57 million budget shortfall projected for FY 2020-21, by significantly reducing expenses and reprioritizing use of restricted resources.
COVID-19 has caused significant additional fiscal challenges for the new fiscal year, including losses of a $12 million cost of living adjustment on minimum baseline state funding (called the Local Control Funding Formula) and $18 million in local revenues, as well as significant deferrals of cash payments from the state. The state budget currently provides some one-time funding to help offset learning losses, but these will not be sufficient to cover all the unforeseen costs related to COVID-19 -- such as technology, personal protective equipment (PPE), enhanced cleaning, health screening, and reduced class sizes -- especially once in-person learning may safely resume.
In April, Mayor Breed announced a partnership between the City, School District, and nonprofit organizations to provide internet connectivity support students in San Francisco who lack home internet access, including the deployment of up to 25 WiFi ""SuperSpots."" Since March 2020, SFUSD has distributed more than 13,000 Chromebooks and 3,500 hotspots, with a focus on 3rd to 12th grade students for distance learning. The City's Department of Technology has connected more than 1,300 public housing units where students live to the internet through the Fiber to Housing program. The City plans to continue expanding Wifi access for low-income residents, with particular focus on students to support learning.
Additionally, in partnership with the Human Rights Commission, the San Francisco Housing Authority, and HOPE SF community anchors, HOPE SF has distributed close to 500 laptops across all four housing sites. HOPE SF continues to work with partners to ensure students have access to the resources they need for distance learning.

""With today's excessive heat, increased #electricity demand and #wildfires taking out transmission lines, system energy supplies could be up to 4,000 megawatts short this evening,"" California ISO said Sunday afternoon on Twitter. The agency asked the public to conserve as much as possible from 3 to 9 p.m. with the hope of avoiding or at least limiting rolling power
outages.
Alameda Municipal Power, the provider for the city of Alameda, said a declaration of a Stage 3 emergency resulting in outages is ""likely"" in a message to customers Sunday.
Marin Clean Energy issued a similar announcement Sunday and like other providers said California is in a ""extreme heat storm.""Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state is taking ""aggressive"" steps to free electrical capacity and reduce demand.
""California has always been the canary in the coal mine for climate change, and this weekend's events only underscore that reality,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""Wildfires have caused system failures, while near record energy demand is predicted as a multi-state heat wave hits the West Coast for the second time in a matter of weeks.""
Customers are asked to shift the bulk of energy use to late night or early daytime hours.
Steps customers can take include setting air conditioning thermostats to 78 degrees, if health permits; deferring use of major appliances; turning off unnecessary lights; unplugging devices not in use; closing blinds and drapes; using fans when possible; and limiting time the refrigerator door is open.
Fires have caused a generator and a solar farm to trip offline, further affecting the state's power grid.

Campaign encourages residents, workers, and visitors to wear face coverings at all times outside the home to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and allow City to continue to reopen social and economic activities
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the launch of a citywide public awareness campaign to educate residents, workers, and visitors about the importance of wearing face coverings at all times outside the home to decrease the spread of COVID-19 and help San Francisco continue reopening. The City worked with the California Academy of Sciences, the African-American Arts and Cultural District, the Latino Task Force, Self-Help for the Elderly, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and Opportunities for All to develop the campaign.
The new campaign supports the City's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with comprehensive, multilingual, and culturally competent outreach and public awareness with the overall goal of seeing more San Franciscans wear masks at all times when outside the home. The citywide campaign will be deployed with posters, signage, and digital billboards in areas where people tend to gather including parks, the Embarcadero and along major merchant corridors. In addition, the campaign includes a robust digital and social media presence with TV, radio, print and streaming ads in addition to out-of-home advertising and targeted outreach in neighborhood and multilingual press using the hashtag #MaskTheSFup.
""We are all eager to see our City reopen more and to be able to support our small businesses, see our youth get back in the classroom and see our friends again,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This campaign reminds us that it is possible, but everyone has a part to play and wearing a mask, socially distancing, and frequent hand washing is key. The good news is that most people are already on board. But we still have to remind people that we are in this for the long run, and if we want to keep reopening, we will have to keep wearing masks when we leave home.""
Wearing face coverings is an efficient and effective way to protect the health and safety of everyone in the city and is a critical part of San Francisco's COVID-19 strategy. According to public health experts, if 80 percent of San Franciscans wore face coverings, the city can prevent outbreaks of COVID-19. Getting all residents to regularly and properly wear masks is critical to the health and safety of our residents and can lead to a significant decrease in the transmission of COVID-19.
The Public Health Department issued a Health Order in May requiring face coverings whenever in public, so that as the City embarked on the path to recovery and additional reopening, outbreaks would be less likely. A recent citywide survey demonstrated a 71 percent compliance rate of mask-wearing, demonstrating that many San Franciscans are doing their part, but that there is more work needed to achieve better compliance.
The campaign includes citywide outreach as well as targeted campaigns in the Mission District, the Excelsior, Chinatown, Oceanview, Merced and Ingleside neighborhoods, the Bayview, the Western Addition, Ingleside and the Tenderloin.
The comprehensive campaign is being deployed in advance of the Labor Day holiday weekend, when people typically gather with friends and families. With that in mind, the City is encouraging people to gather safely by avoiding indoor activities, planning activities to minimize contact, and wearing face coverings. More information about how to gather safely is available online here.
Face coverings help to stop droplets that may be infectious, even if the person wearing the mask has no or mild symptoms. By strengthening this form of protection, San Franciscans will be better prepared to participate safely in the gradual reopening of activities.
Face coverings should cover the nose and mouth and fit securely. They can be a manufactured or homemade mask, a bandanna, scarf, towel, or similar item. Cloth face coverings should be cleaned frequently with soap and water. Masks with one-way valves are not effective because they allow air droplets to freely escape when the wearer exhales. They should not be worn and do not qualify as a face covering under the order. More information about face coverings be found here.
Wearing a face covering is most effective when combined with physical distancing and hand washing. It is not a substitute for staying home, but it is a way to protect other people and reduce the chance of transmission when outside the house. San Francisco's Stay Home Order is still in effect, and residents should continue to stay inside as much as possible.
""As a living part of our San Francisco community for nearly two centuries, the California Academy of Sciences is energized to help flatten the curve,"" Scott Sampson, PhD., Executive Director, California Academy of Sciences. ""We know science, and we know our city—we're sharing our research-backed expertise to help keep everyone safe and help us continue to reopen. We all want to support our families, save our favorite businesses, and enjoy magical museum days by the Bay. Your trusted voice for science is asking everyone to wear a mask, now.""
""It is essential that our African American San Francisco residents feel seen and heard. Opening up the lines of communication between government and community is often the most important step,"" Ericka Scott, Programs Director, San Francisco African American Arts and Cultural District. ""Our youth and young adults paint the colors of their world everyday as they see it. When we support youth and foster leadership, we empower them, while breaking down those generational barriers. Every time our young leaders and our community mentors share the same message another link in the chain of racial and socioeconomic bondage breaks. The content in our marketing campaign not only represents who we are as a people, but it is intentional in making sure that we build awareness around best practices to keep our residents safe from COVID-19.""
""We are honored to partner with the City to educate our Chinese speaking seniors and families the importance of wearing a mask to prevent the spread of COIVD-19,"" said Anni Chung, Executive Director, Self-Help for the Elderly. ""Providing linguistically and culturally competent information is crucial to many of our monolingual seniors and residents. Self Help for the Elderly, along with many other API community-based organizations, serve a large number of seniors, immigrants, and low-income families that depend on getting their public health and safety information in Chinese and other languages.""
""Representation and inclusion is important. The Latino Task Force collaboration with the Joint Information Center has allowed for our community to be represented and included,"" said Susana Rojas, Latino Task Force Communications Committee Chair. ""By depicting images that relate to the Latino community we are ensuring that the message is effective, culturally relevant and that it supports our vulnerable communities.""
""It is common for younger generations to be plagued by apathy when it comes to politics and civic engagement, and unfortunately, this virus has become highly politicized. We have been dealt an enormous amount of obstacles by previous generations, so indifference is understandable but also unsustainable,"" said Athena Edwards, Fellow, Opportunities for All. ""It is imperative that our generation feel empowered to take care of themselves and each other, because we need to take an active role in fixing our nation's challenges, even beyond COVID-19. The hope is that by encouraging the city's youth to illustrate, both literally and figuratively, proper COVID protocol, we can motivate all young residents in the city to take this virus seriously and save lives.""
""The LGBTQ community has been here before. In the 80s we showed the world how to respond to a virus with compassion and common sense. Together, we can do it again,"" said Sister Roma, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. ""Here in the Bay Area we believe in science and trust the experts. Right now, we know that the best way to protect ourselves and others is to wear a face covering and practice social distancing. We will be able to gather, dance, and hug each other again, but only if we #MaskUp and #PracticeSafeSix.""

San Francisco's updated timeline allows for a safer and gradual reopening, balances the risk of the activity with the ability of the City's resources to manage COVID-19 cases
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health, and Assessor-Recorder Carmen Chu, co-Chair of the City's Economic Recovery Task Force, today announced the next steps in San Francisco's reopening of businesses and activities.
Since July, San Francisco has been on the State's COVID-19 watch list, which restricted many activities and required the City to pause further reopening. On Friday, August 28, the State issued new criteria and a colored-coded tiered system, which replaced the watch list. San Francisco has been placed on the ""red"" tier, which provides the City the discretion to move forward with reopening some activities. While San Francisco recognizes the State's thresholds, the City will continue on a reopening path based on its unique challenges and successes, and maintains the ability to open more gradually than what the State allows.
""Our priority has always been to protect the health and safety of the people of San Francisco,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Since March, people have been struggling financially, mentally, and emotionally, and being able to continue our gradual reopening of businesses and activities will help to ease some of that burden. We remain committed to making decisions based on data and our local conditions with COVID-19, and our next steps take a balanced and thoughtful approach to reopening. But we all need to do our part to reopen while keeping our community safe, so remember to cover your face, keep your distance, and wash your hands regularly.""
San Francisco's immediate path forward starts with outdoor activities that are lower risk and moves to indoor activities that are lower risk and with limited capacity. In parallel to this, in-person learning and child and youth development activities will also be opened on a rolling basis. Today, outdoor personal services are resuming, as well as indoor malls at limited capacity. Additional services, businesses, and activities will resume over the coming weeks and months, as long as San Francisco continues to make progress on limiting the spread of COVID-19.
""We know our communities and businesses are anxious to get back to work and start doing some regular activities,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We will continue our deliberate and gradual reopening as it allows us to monitor the spread, manage its immediate challenges and mitigate the long term impact on our city. Our reopening pace will be informed by our ability to manage the risk of more activity that may result in more cases and hospitalizations.""
""Time and again, San Franciscans have risen to the challenge to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, Co-Chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""That collective action is what has allowed us to be here today. Reflected in comments we've heard from hundreds of people through the Economic Recovery Task Force, this announcement is important because it shows the path forward for so many industries and businesses that have been shuttered for months. Let's keep each other safe and let's work together to sustain our steady openings.""
""San Franciscans have made real and ongoing sacrifices to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to get back in a position where we can begin reopening again,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""This crisis is multi-faceted, and as a City, we're extremely concerned about the enormous economic toll it's taking, especially on those who are out of work and for businesses that have not been able to reopen. We're keeping these workers and businesses center of mind, and that's why we've moved ahead immediately with reopening personal services and will continue quickly but carefully expanding our reopening.""
The gradual reopening of outdoor services, malls, and children's activities will increase travel and interaction throughout the city, which means increasing community spread of the virus and an increase in cases. Public health officials will need to regularly assess the Key Public Health Indicators, particularly new positive case counts and hospitalizations to ensure San Francisco has the necessary resources available for those that are infected.
As San Francisco moves forward with reopening businesses, more than 50 San Francisco Transitional Kindergarten (TK)-6 grade schools have been provided an application for in-person learning with limited capacity. These applications are under review and will be approved within two to four weeks. The goal is for in-classroom learning to resume on rolling basis, starting with the youngest children. Additionally, applications for Community Hubs are currently being accepted, and the program is scheduled to start on September 14. Other child and youth development activities are underway including after-school programs and childcare facilities.
San Francisco's updated reopening plan is outlined below and is available online at SF.gov/reopening. Reopening is dependent upon San Francisco's Health indicators remaining stable or improving, and the plan below is subject to change. All San Franciscans must do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19, including face masking, social distancing and handwashing. The reopening of most of the below activities and businesses requires limited capacity and approved health and safety plans.
San Francisco's Path Forward to Reopening
Outdoor activities – Moving Forward September 1
GOAL: Mid-September, Low Risk Outdoor Activities and TK-6th grade in-person learning
GOAL: End of September, Low Risk Indoor Activities
GOAL: October, Middle School in-person learning
GOAL: November, High Schools, additional learning activities

70,/california/san-francisco/san-francisco-election-details-laid-out,2020-09-01T16:49:33Z,San Francisco Election Details Laid Out,0,1,Bay City News,News Partner,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA — Officials with the San Francisco Department of Elections on Monday morning unveiled preliminary plans for the upcoming November U.S. presidential elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Back in June, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced voters throughout the state will receive vote-by-mail ballots for the Nov. 3 election in order to minimize in-person voting as the pandemic continues.
However, President Donald Trump, who is running for reelection, has criticized the move, alleging possible delays within the U.S. Postal Service could lead to voter suppression. San Francisco Supervisor Hillary Ronen called on elections department officials to lay out their plan at the Board of Supervisors' Rules Committee on Monday.
""There is a lot of work ahead to make sure that people are educated and informed and supported to adjust to this new way of voting,"" Ronen said. ""The November election may be the most important one of our lifetimes, during this state of emergency and with the concerning rise nationally of voter suppression, especially directed at communities of color. It is more urgent than ever that we keep our democracy active, safe and secure.""
Elections department Director John Arntz said the department is currently focusing on areas like voter outreach and education, safety protocols for voters and workers at in-person voting locations, and ensuring the vote-by-mail process runs smoothly.
Arntz added that the department has been in contact with the Postal Service to try to resolve any potential issues with mailing the ballots, including providing the Postal Service with samples of the vote-by-mail packets.
""The post office, they've been able to run these samples through the equipment to determine that the ballot packets will run through the equipment without any issues, so there's no delay with the mail getting to the voters or back to the department,"" he said.
Arntz also said that while some ballots will be processed at City Hall, most will be processed at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium Center.
A new state law will give poll workers more time to process ballots — 29 days before election day instead of the previous 10 days, and 17 days after the polls have closed.
In addition to sending their ballots by mail, voters will also be able to drop ballots off at any of the 588 in-person voting locations citywide.
Arntz said typically, about 25 percent of the votes at in-person polling locations are from people dropping off vote-by-mail ballots. ""This election, we expect that number to potentially double,"" he said.
So far, the department has enlisted 1,800 poll workers for the entire process, and is looking to recruit about 1,200 more, Arntz said.
The Office of Racial Equity Director Shakirah Smiley implored Arntz to increase outreach, especially to voters of color and residents in areas with low voter turnouts.
""We know our electorate, particularly in California, is increasingly Black, is increasingly brown, young and multi-lingual. But we also know that folks are facing increased housing and economic insecurities,"" she said. ""We need to make sure we do a little extra. We can't assume everyone has equal access to information and to voting.""
Supervisor Catherine Stefani said, ""Between the pandemic's impacts on our capacity to really facilitate in-person voting, and then, of course, the Trump Administration's attacks on the Postal Service and voting by mail, and the fact that this could very well turn out to be the highest election turnouts in our lifetime, I know that the anxiety we feel is that we can't afford any missteps, oversights or errors.""
San Francisco voters should start seeing their ballots arrive in the mail between Oct.5 and Oct. 9, and replacement ballots will be available through Oct. 30 for those who need them, according to Arntz.
Residents have through Oct. 19 to register to receive a ballot in the mail.

Face shields, masks, and sanitizers from the State will be distributed to thousands of small businesses and their workers in neighborhoods most impacted by COVID-19
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, in partnership with the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services and the California Office of the Small Business Advocate, today announced the delivery of over one million surgical masks, 600,000 face shields, and 150,000 bottles of hand sanitizer for distribution to businesses and workers in the city's most vulnerable communities, including in the Mission, Bayview and Chinatown. The shipment of 360 pallets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) comes as San Francisco prepares to launch a public awareness campaign to remind and encourage people to wear face coverings in advance of the Labor Day weekend.
Today, Mayor Breed joined the Latino Task Force and Calle 24 in the Mission to distribute PPE from the Latino Task Force Resource Hub.
""Reopening safely is critical for our City's health and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We know that using PPE like face coverings and following good hygiene practices are what will allow us to safely reopen and get businesses back on their feet,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Small businesses all over our city have been hit-hard financially, and for those businesses that have been able to stay open or will soon reopen, figuring out how to safely operate a business during a global pandemic is hard work. We hope this distribution of PPE will relieve some of the stress we know business owners are feeling, ensure they have the necessary equipment to protect their employees and customers, and will give them one less thing to worry about.""
""For our small businesses looking to reopen outdoors this week, including hair salons and barber shops, we're going to where the need is, getting free personal protective equipment directly to our small businesses in underserved corridors and protecting workers and those they serve against COVID-19,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Together with the State and community partners in neighborhoods across the city, we're relieving our hardworking San Francisco small businesses of one more pressure as they push our city towards recovery and safely get their business and their workers back to work.""
""Facial coverings are a critical part of COVID-19 prevention,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""Recent research indicates that if 80% of a population is regularly and properly using face coverings, we can prevent outbreaks of COVID-19. This PPE delivery ensures facial coverings are more accessible to the essential workers who continue to serve us and to the small businesses that are taking preventive steps to protect employees, customers and communities.""
""Today's announcement is a win for workers, customers, and businesses. San Franciscans have been coming together to do right by our workers and each other. We've been wearing masks and taking precautions. This latest program makes vital sanitation and protective masks available to businesses so we can keep on opening safely,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, Co-Chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force.
The Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) is working in collaboration with community-based organizations to distribute a month's supply of PPE to local businesses that are open or will reopen in neighborhoods throughout San Francisco. The PPE distributed will include surgical masks, face shields, and hand sanitizer. The City's goal is to save businesses the time and expense of procuring this PPE, and to help them focus and prepare for safer operations.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has brought extreme hardship to small businesses, especially those in our underserved communities, yet these dedicated entrepreneurs are determined to survive and committed to creating safe environments for their employees and customers,"" said Isabel Guzman, California's Small Business Advocate. ""The California Office of the Small Business Advocate and the California Office of Emergency Services is proud to partner with the City and County of San Francisco and their nonprofit partners to get personal protective equipment quickly into the hands of our small business owners so that the Main Streets that define our neighborhoods can operate safely.""
OEWD developed an equitable distribution plan of the PPE based on the following priorities:
More than 25 community partners responded to a survey about the need for PPE among thousands of businesses and organizations in their neighborhoods. The community partners have offered to pick-up and distribute the PPE to local businesses citywide including within the Bayview, Castro/Upper Market, Chinatown, Excelsior and Outer Mission, Japantown, Mission, Ocean View, Merced Heights and Ingleside, Richmond, Sunset, Portola, Visitacion Valley, SoMa, Parkside, Tenderloin and Lower Polk, Treasure Island, and Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 neighborhoods. Goodwill Industries and the SF Market are also supporting PPE distribution to local small businesses and their workers. The partners are also set up with staff to provide multi-language outreach in monolingual communities.
""Protecting our workers is essential and supporting our small businesses is needed now more than ever. This distribution of PPE will help achieve both goals and help ensure that we continue to help lower the spread of COVID-19,"" said Jon Jocobo, Small Business Committee Chair of the Latino Task Force Member and serves as Vice President and council member of the Calle 24 Cultural District.
""This is a unique time where we're challenged to ensure our local businesses, workers, and customers are kept safe while keeping them open and operating through this pandemic. We are grateful to the City for the supplies and their timely response to the needs of our community. Not only does this send an important message that we're all working together, but it also assures the Black community that our voices are being heard. Historically, our community has not been heard and this is an important step to ensure we're working toward change in solidarity,"" said Ericka Scott and Ebon Glenn, Co-Directors of the African-American Arts and Cultural District.
""We've been in business for 18 years and my family and I have worked and lived in the Mission all our lives. This community is our home. Running a business isn't easy and it was made more difficult during this pandemic, but we are still here thanks to all our valued customers,"" said Elizabeth Vasquez, owner of Tio Chilo's Grill on 24th Street. ""The hand sanitizers and facial masks will allow us to continue to keep us as staff safe while protecting our valued customers as we serve them.""
""We are grateful to the Mayor who understands the importance of having PPEs so that we can overcome this pandemic together. The PPEs for API Council will be directly used by our non-profit organizations providing safety net services to our most vulnerable populations,"" said Cally Wong, Director of the API Council.
The procurement, shipment, and distribution of the PPE pallets was made possible through the support and contributions of the San Francisco Port, the Department of Emergency Management and the Emergency Operations Center, the Treasure Island Development Authority, Neighborhood Economic Development Agencies (NEDOs), Main Street Launch, and community-based organizations.
Community partners will have a month to pick up the PPE for distribution to businesses through an organized schedule at an undisclosed storage facility. Local businesses that need PPE may directly reach out to their nearby community-based organization.

August 28, 2020
Haircuts, barber services, massages, and nail services are among personal services that can resume operating outdoors
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Public Health, today announced that outdoor personal services will resume in San Francisco, effective Tuesday, September 1, 2020. Outdoor gyms and fitness centers can reopen starting September 9, 2020. Additionally, the Mayor and Dr. Colfax announced that once San Francisco is removed from the State's watch list, the City's top priorities for reopening will be the gradual opening of classrooms, services that support the development of children, and other activities that can occur outdoors.
Outdoor personal services that can operate include haircuts, barber services, massages and nail services. Only those services where both clients and providers can be masked at all times are allowed to resume. The City has posted information and guidance in multiple languages for businesses and is conducting outreach to personal services businesses to ensure they have access to the guidance and are able to prepare accordingly.
""All businesses in San Francisco are struggling, and while many have been able to reopen with modifications in place, providers of personal services like hair salons, barber shops and massage establishments have remained shuttered. This has created a huge financial challenge for their owners and employees, and I am so glad that those businesses will soon be able to reopen for outdoor service,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We know it won't be seamless to operate outdoors, but we stand ready to support with programs like Shared Spaces and health and safety guidance so that people can get back to work while also protecting themselves and their clients.""
The San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH) will continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 infection as more of the city population circulates and interacts, and will keep reviewing the City's Key Public Health Indicators to ensure San Francisco's gradual reopening and allowance of outdoor personal services does not drive a surge in infections and hospitalizations.
""San Francisco led the nation and saved lives with our measured approach to re-opening,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax. ""Our priority is moving forward with an incremental phased approach that helps us avert large outbreaks, avoids overwhelming our healthcare system and lessens the possibility of more severe damage to our economy. We will monitor the virus as we gradually reopen activities for children as well as outdoor businesses to gauge the spread of the virus and our ability to manage and contain it.""
""It's important that we continue to find ways for business to reopen even if it means starting outdoors,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, Co-Chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""The coming months will be the warmest, followed by the high retail season. Let's give business a fighting chance and understand that the small sacrifices we individually make, like wearing a mask, can make the difference on reopening and help save a business.""
""As a City, we are going to continue doing everything we can to support our small businesses while protecting the health and safety of workers and the public,"" said Joaquin Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Reopening personal services outdoors is our next step, but the goal is to keep taking these steps as quickly as it's safe to do so. We're talking with businesses and our Public Health leaders daily to ensure San Francisco is exploring every option to safely expand new opportunities for reopening.""
In May, Mayor Breed announced the creation of the Shared Spaces Program to support neighborhoods by providing additional public space to support local business activities. Shared Spaces allows neighborhood businesses to share a portion of the public right-of-way, such as sidewalks, full or partial streets, or other nearby public spaces like parks and plazas for neighborhood retail activity, as allowed by San Francisco's Public Health Order. The program allows individual businesses or local merchant associations to apply for a no-cost, expedited permit to share the sidewalk or parking lane for business purposes. The City has issued 1,215 Shared Spaces permits to date.
In addition to Shared Spaces, San Francisco has provided financial assistance through grant and loan programs to support small businesses. Since the pandemic began, San Francisco has allocated $17.2 million to support over 1,130 small businesses.
Once San Francisco is off the State's watch list and DPH determines it is safe to begin reopening, the City's gradual reopening will focus on equity and safety, opening those areas with the least risk while helping those who are suffering as a result of the Stay Home Order. Schools, community hubs and after-school programs provide a critical source of support for children, youth, and their families, and helped mitigate socio-economic disparities through school meal programs and social, physical, behavioral, and mental health services. Therefore, returning children to learning environments, whether it is a classroom, a Community Hub, or after school program, remains a top priority for the City.
Since San Francisco remains on the State's watch list, in-classroom learning can continue only for elementary schools with a waiver from DPH. To date, 53 schools have notified DPH of their desire to apply for waivers for in classroom learning. Waiver applications will be distributed next week.
Focused enrollment for the City's Community Hubs began this week and is offered to select families based on priority population criteria, which includes HOPE SF, public housing; homeless youth; foster care youth; English language learners; low-income African American, Latino, Pacific Islander and Asian families. More information about this program can be found here.

August 27, 2020
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed issued the following statement following the Board of Supervisor's Budget and Appropriations Committee passing amendments to the Mayor's Proposed Budget for Fiscal Years (FY) 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. The Budget will now go to a vote by the full Board of Supervisors and will need to be signed by Mayor Breed.
""This is a challenging time for all of us. Over 200,000 San Franciscans have filed for unemployment. Small businesses have closed permanently. Our City's revenues have been decimated by COVID. Our residents, our small business owners, our families, and our workers are struggling. People in our city are making hard choices each and every day. Our City leaders need to do the same.
I appreciate our workforce and what they do every day for our city, which is why it was so important to me from the beginning of this pandemic that we not lay off any City workers because of COVID. And when I proposed my budget last month, we closed an historic $1.5 billion deficit without laying off a single City worker or dramatically reducing services. It wasn't easy, but I made the tough choices that put our residents and the services they deserve first.
I deeply respect the work of the Budget Chair, Supervisor Sandra Fewer, and her collaborative approach to this budget. We share and collectively supported key funding priorities including mental health, COVID response, and support for the African American community. But I have deep concerns about the Board's decision to spend our entire $59 million in business tax reserves. The fiscal stability of our city and our ability to continue to deliver essential services can't be ignored. There is so much we don't know right now. We don't know how long COVID will be here, we don't know how long the federal government will continue to reimburse us for expenses, we don't know when tourists will return, we don't know the impacts of people working from home will have on our downtown economy, we don't know how long it will take our entire economy to recover, and we don't know the outcome of hundreds of millions of dollars that is up for a vote on this November's ballot.
As Mayor, I have a responsibility beyond this budget to ensure we can continue to deliver for the residents of San Francisco not just today, but tomorrow, next month, and in the years ahead. I cannot support the Board's decision to appropriate additional funds from our reserves that threatens our ability to do so. I will use all of my discretion and authority to protect this City from any additional financial risks. Our residents deserve, expect, and demand better.""
Mayor Breed introduced her budget proposal for FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 on July 31, which included new investments to prioritize racial equity and reinvest in the African-American community, continue making progress on homelessness and behavioral health, and maintain the City's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The budget proposal made these important investments while also balancing the two-year $1.5 billion deficit with a responsible use of reserves, preserving jobs and with minimal impact to City services

Maceo May Apartments -- part of 8,000 new homes under development on Treasure Island -- will provide housing for 104 homeless and formerly homeless veterans once complete
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the groundbreaking of the Maceo May Apartment complex, which will provide 100% affordable housing for 104 formerly homeless veterans on Treasure Island. The redevelopment of Treasure Island will ultimately include 8,000 new homes, over 27% of which will be affordable, 550,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, 300 hotel rooms, and 290 acres of public open space.
""The vision for a revitalized Treasure Island is to create an equitable and thriving new community that serves the needs of people at all income levels,"" said Mayor Breed. ""I'm glad we're able to move this project move forward even with all the current challenges we're experiencing with COVID-19. It's crucial that we continue to build safe, affordable places to live for our most vulnerable residents.""
The 104-unit Maceo May Apartment complex is co-developed by Swords to Plowshares (STP) and the Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC), with 39 of the total units set aside for formerly homeless veterans currently living on Treasure Island and the remaining 65 units for currently homeless veterans. The Maceo May Apartment project is one of up to 20 buildings that will be 100 percent affordable on Treasure Island. Of the 8,000 units on Treasure Island, 2,176 will be affordable.
STP supports nearly 3,000 homeless, low-income and at-risk veterans in the Bay Area every year through employment and job training, supportive housing programs, permanent housing placement, counseling and case management, and legal services. Chinatown CDC serves as neighborhood advocates, organizers and planners, and as developers and managers of affordable housing in San Francisco.
The new apartment building is named in recognition of the dedication and advocacy of Maceo May, a Vietnam War veteran who worked at STP for 12 years and subsequently served as a board member for 14 years, until his passing in 2014. May's advocacy played a crucial role in ensuring homeless veterans would be recognized and served on Treasure Island.
""The groundbreaking of Maceo May is a huge milestone in Treasure Island's redevelopment that will provide critical replacement units for current residents, and house additional formerly homeless and low-income veterans,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney. ""The Island is one the most diverse communities in San Francisco, and it's fitting that it will be home to this project.""
""Having a home is a critical way to end poverty among veterans, and to restore hope, dignity and self-sufficiency,"" said Michael Blecker, Executive Director, Swords to Plowshares. ""This housing site, in memory of our first-ever Housing Director Maceo May, is critical to overcoming obstacles some veterans face.""
""This project is a step towards ending homelessness in San Francisco, and it will build community along the way through its commitment to hiring veterans during the construction process,"" said Malcolm Yeung, Executive Director, Chinatown CDC.
Mike Bartell, who served in the United States Marine Corps from 1969-1973 and currently lives on Treasure Island, will be moving into a Maceo May apartment when the structure is completed in 2022. ""Having housing on Treasure Island has provided a brand-new life for me. After being homeless for five years, it feels great to now have a home and a new community on a former military base,"" he said.
The six-story modular construction building, designed by Mithun, includes studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units with spaces designed to serve veterans. Current plans include a meal program and common open space with a forested ""healing garden,"" playground, solar-powered community room and other amenities.
Maceo May is being constructed upon infrastructure built by Treasure Island Community Development (TICD), the master developer responsible for all utilities, site improvements, and other public facilities on Treasure Island. In addition to producing new, state-of-the-art infrastructure, TICD will oversee the development of nearly 6,000 market rate housing units. TICD's first new residential project on adjacent Yerba Buena Island will be completed in 2021.
The construction team for the Maceo May project will include several contractors and suppliers that are certified Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises. Veterans participating in a construction job training program developed by One Treasure Island (One TI) are also being hired to build Maceo May Apartments.
""This program provides pathways from poverty to lasting financial self-sufficiency and progress,"" said Sherry Williams, Executive Director, One Treasure Island.
One TI is a collaboration of community-based nonprofit organizations, including Swords to Plowshares and Chinatown CDC, overseeing affordable housing and economic development opportunities for formerly homeless and low-income San Franciscans. The training program culminates in real jobs hires by EcoBay Services and by other construction industry contractors.
""The timing of this training program was amazing,"" said Neil Putzer, a 22-year old Navy veteran, who completed One TI's construction training program and will be working for San Francisco-based Cahill Contractors on the Maceo May project. ""I left the Navy right before the COVID crisis, so I feel lucky that I went through the job training through Swords to Plowshares, which led to a great paying job in the construction industry.""
In May, Mayor Breed announced a $43.7 million construction loan that allowed the $75 million project to move ahead. Maceo May Apartments financing support comes from the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development, TIDA, the State of California Veterans Housing and Homelessness Prevention Program, Raymond James, Silicon Valley Bank, and the California Community Reinvestment Corporation. Operating subsidies will be delivered through the City's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing Continuum of Care program and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.
Community Driven Partners
Founded in 1994, One Treasure Island's charter was to ensure that supportive housing and employment programs for formerly homeless households were an integral component of the reuse plan. Maceo May was One TI's first Board President. Since 1999 both market rate and formerly homeless households have been living in former Navy housing on an interim basis. Well over 10,000 homeless and low-income San Franciscans have been served on Treasure Island in housing, employment and financial services provided by One TI and its members, including Swords to Plowshares and Chinatown Community Development Center who are co-developers of Maceo May Apartments. Other One TI members include Catholic Charities, Community Housing Partnership, Mercy Housing California, Health Right360, Rubicon Programs, and Toolworks.
Historic Treasure Island
Treasure Island was activated as a United States Naval Base in 1940 and played a substantial role in World War II and the Korean War. In 1993, the Federal Government placed the Treasure Island Naval Station on its Base Realignment and Closure list and it was formally decommissioned in 1997. In 1994, the City began to conduct hearings and community meetings that informed the redevelopment plan that will result in a new San Francisco neighborhood incorporating residents of various socio-economic backgrounds. The Treasure Island Development Authority was also formed in 1997 as a non-profit, public benefit agency dedicated to the economic development of the former Naval Station and the administration of municipal services.

San Francisco is working with the local restaurant industry to develop a standardized health and safety plan and protocols to help restaurants prepare for reopening
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health, and Assessor-Recorder Carmen Chu, co-Chair of the City's Economic Recovery Task Force, today announced San Francisco's plan for reopening indoor dining. San Francisco will move forward with indoor dining at 25% capacity, up to 100 people, once classified as ""orange"" on the State's tiered system, which will occur no sooner than the end of the month. The San Francisco Department of Public Health is developing health and safety guidelines in coordination with the local restaurant industry in order to prepare restaurants for the safest reopening possible.
""Restaurants have been hit hard by COVID-19. Many have adapted with takeout and outdoor dining, but they've still been barely hanging on and, sadly, some have closed for good,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We are laying out the next steps to make sure restaurants are ready to reopen as safely as possible. I want to thank the Golden Gate Restaurant Association for working with us to get to this point. Helping our restaurant industry survive this pandemic is a key part of our longer-term economic recovery.""
San Francisco is currently assigned to the State's ""red"" tier, which provides the City the discretion to move forward with reopening some activities and services, including indoor salons and gyms. While San Francisco recognizes the State's thresholds, the City will continue on a reopening path based on its local health indicators and unique challenges and successes of our local reopening. Based on the State's tiered system, the earliest that San Francisco will move to the less restrictive ""orange"" tier is at the end of September. However, if local COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations do not remain stable, San Francisco may not meet the criteria of the orange tier and will remain in the red tier.
""We appreciate our vibrant restaurant community's sacrifice throughout this pandemic, and we want to thank them for their cooperation and patience that has brought us to this point,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""While health officials continue to monitor the virus, we also need San Franciscans to continue practicing the health and safety precautions needed for us to reopen our city gradually.""
The City is working with the Golden Gate Restaurant Association to develop a self-certification process for reopening indoor dining in San Francisco. This process will provide restaurants the information and tools they need to prepare to safely reopen indoor dining with limited capacity and other modifications in place. Before restaurants can reopen, they will need to complete a self-certification documenting their ability to comply with minimum standards for operating indoor dining in San Francisco.
""Our measured approach to reopening is grounded in science and facts, and science clearly tells us that indoor activities come with additional risk,"" said Dr. Tomás Aragón. ""We must work with the restaurants and business owners to implement strong safety protocols that help mitigate this additional risk and protect the safety of our employees, customers, and the community.""
""I grew up waiting tables at my parent's family restaurant. Knowing first-hand what it takes to keep a business going, it's been my priority to find pathways for businesses to reopen and stay in San Francisco,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, Co-Chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""The next step will be to work in the coming week with public health and restaurants to ensure we have clear guidelines for how we can more safely operate indoors for workers and customers.""
""Today's announcement brings hope to our San Francisco restaurants and the thousands of workers who need these jobs,"" said Laurie Thomas, Executive Director, Golden Gate Restaurant Association. ""The past six months have caused so much pain and financial hardship for many. Having a clear and safe path to move forward with indoor dining, even at a limited capacity, will mean restaurants have the chance to reopen and/or see a way to not have to close. We thank the Mayor and her staff, and Dr. Aragón and Dr. Colfax for working with us to make this possible.""
""For restaurants on Larkin Street in Little Saigon, the news that we may be able to begin reopening indoors again in weeks rather than months is really hopeful,"" said Rene Colorado, Executive Director of the Tenderloin Merchants Association. ""Outdoor dining has been important but it's not enough alone, especially as we approach the wetter, colder months. Today's news offers some hope there really may be a light at the end of the tunnel.""
""We're very happy Mayor Breed is being proactive in helping small businesses by listening to them and taking action,"" said Small Business Commissioner William Ortiz-Cartagena. ""Restaurants are telling us what they need and reopening indoors is the next step to saving these businesses and all the jobs they support. We commend the Mayor and appreciate her for standing with us and all our small businesses in these challenging times.""
""It's great to hear that we will be allowed to have indoor dining again, especially after having to close our busting dining room on Larkin Street in Little Saigon for six months,"" said Thao Pham, owner of Turtle Tower Restaurant. ""We are very excited to welcome guests back into our restaurant and its helpful to have more notice this time, so we can begin planning how best to do so responsibly and safely.""
Reopening Next Week
In-classroom learning with limited capacity for TK-6th grade will begin to resume September 21st for schools that have submitted a safety plan and have received approval. Indoor museums and galleries may submit health and safety plans this week and will be able to open as early as Monday, September 21st. Additionally, San Francisco continues to evaluate ways to bring other activities, including indoor movies, bars, nightlife, and offices back safely.
Prior Reopening
Earlier this week, San Francisco's reopening continued with additional outdoor and indoor activities. The businesses and services that resumed indoors with limited capacity include hair salons, barber shops, massage services, nail salons, gyms and fitness centers. Only those services where face coverings can be worn at all times by everyone involved will reopen at this time. Hotels, outdoor family entertainment centers, drive-in entertainment such as outdoor movies, and outdoor tour buses and boats also reopened on Monday under rules for outdoor gatherings.
The reopening of businesses and activities will increase travel and interaction throughout the city, which means increasing community spread of the virus and an increase in cases. Public health officials will regularly assess the Key Public Health Indicators, particularly new positive case counts and hospitalizations to ensure San Francisco has the necessary resources available for those that are infected.
San Francisco's reopening plan is available online at SF.gov/reopening. Reopening is dependent upon San Francisco's Health indicators remaining stable or improving, and the plan is subject to change. All San Franciscans must do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19, including face masking, social distancing and handwashing.

The order had been scheduled to take effect at 11:59 p.m. Sunday. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler ruled, based on the evidence presented in part at a Saturday hearing, that the order was a burden on protected speech of WeChat users in the United States.
She found that although the government had identified significant national security interests for its action, the order was not ""narrowly tailored"" to protecting those interests.
The preliminary injunction will preserve the status quo pending trial on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims. WeChat began in China as a messaging app and over the years added additional functionality, including calling, video conferencing, and in-app payments. Because of the many functions integrated within the app, plaintiffs described it as a ""super-app.""
WeChat is estimated to have more than a billion users worldwide, including 19 million in the United States, according to the plaintiffs' complaint.
The government contended that the app is used by the Chinese government for surveillance and data collection within the United States and that the order was a justified exercise of the president's national security powers against a ""foreign adversary whose hostile acts are undisputed, and whose aspirations for global dominance are undisputed.""
The order, as subsequently interpreted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, imposed a number of limitations and prohibitions on WeChat and third parties, including prohibiting new downloads of the WeChat app, stopping the transfer of funds out of the United States, and forbidding the providing of technical services to WeChat by third parties.
The commerce department's interpretation limited the order to business-to-business transactions, not to ""WeChat users who use the app for personal communications.""
The plaintiffs contended that by prohibiting third-party services such as web hosting and internet transit services, WeChat would be effectively shut down, depriving millions of Chinese-speaking Americans of the primary platform they can use to communicate and interact with friends and family in China.
The government disputed that the order amounted to a shutdown, but conceded that the order would likely, over time, to lead to a ""deterioration of functionality.""
The judge found that as a result of the order ""the app, while perhaps technically available to existing U.S. users, likely will be useless to them."" Beeler determined that a preliminary injunction was needed to protect plaintiffs from ""irreparable harm.""

The order, as subsequently interpreted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, imposed a number of limitations and prohibitions on WeChat and third parties, including prohibiting new downloads of the WeChat app, stopping the transfer of funds out of the United States, and forbidding the
providing of technical services to WeChat by third parties.
The commerce department's interpretation limited the Order to business-to-business transactions not to ""WeChat users who use the app for
personal communications.""
Much of the hearing focused on whether the order amounted to a
shutdown of the app. The plaintiffs contended that by prohibiting third-party services
such as web hosting and internet transit services, WeChat will be effectively be shut down, depriving millions of Chinese-speaking Americans of the primary platform they can use to communicate and interact with friends and family in China.
The government disputed that the order amounted to a shutdown, but conceded that the order would likely, over time, to lead to a ""deterioration of functionality.""
The order is scheduled to take effect at 11:59 p.m. on Sept. 20. The judge took the matter under advisement and promised to issue her ruling before the end of the day.

79,/california/san-francisco/more-federal-charges-city-hall-corruption-probe,2020-09-18T16:14:46Z,More Federal Charges In City Hall Corruption Probe,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA — Federal prosecutors in San Francisco announced criminal charges for two new suspects in a public corruption investigation, both accused of bribing embattled former Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru.
Alan Varela and Bill Gilmartin, the president and vice president, respectively, of a Bay Area civil engineering and construction firm Proven Management, have both been charged with bribery.
According to an affidavit filed by federal prosecutors, Varela, 59, and Gilmartin, 50, provided Nuru with gifts since as early as 2013, such as $20,000 in meals and a $40,000 tractor for Nuru's personal vacation home.
In exchange for the gifts, Nuru allegedly provided the pair with inside information about a city contract that Varela and Gilmartin were seeking.
The contract was to build and operate an asphalt recycling plant. Varela, a Napa resident, and Gilmartin, a San Mateo resident, are the seventh and eighth defendants to be charged in the federal public corruption investigation.
If convicted, they could each face a maximum of 10 years in prison. Federal prosecutors also announced Thursday that two others who were previously charged in the corruption probe, engineering firm executive and one-time Pubic Works engineer Balmore Hernandez and construction company owner Florence Kong, will plead guilty.
Back in June, prosecutors charged Hernandez, 55, with bribery and Kong, 62, with making false statements. Prosecutors allege Kong, a Hillsborough resident, gave Nuru a Rolex watch worth more than $35,000, among other gifts, in exchange for help in gaining a contract.
Additionally, they allege Hernandez gifted Nuru in 2018 with $52,000 worth of building materials for Nuru's vacation home.
On top of the guilty plea, Hernandez has agreed to cooperate with the corruption investigation. Kong's guilty plea, however, is not a cooperation plea, prosecutors said. In a statement, Kong's attorney John Runfola, said Kong would be entering her guilty plea in the coming weeks.
He described Kong as a hardworking Chinese immigrant who lifted herself out of poverty with limited English-speaking skills, becoming a businesswoman and a prominent member of the city's Chinese community.
""She learned how to be successful from local leaders who advised her 'how things worked in San Francisco.' Unfortunately, some of the advice she received led to her conduct in this case,"" he said.
""Public works contracts in San Francisco are supposed to be awarded on a merit system in San Francisco for the benefit of the residents and taxpayers,"" said David Anderson, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, in a statement.
""The complaint filed today alleges that this merit system was undermined with insider information and favorable treatment. Instead of awarding public works contracts on the basis of merit, the defendants allegedly sought to secure significant profits on the basis of bribes and backroom deals.""
Prosecutors charged Nuru in January with one count of honest services wire fraud for allegedly carrying out an unsuccessful scheme to bribe a San Francisco International Airport commissioner to aid restaurateur Nick Bovis in obtaining a restaurant concession in 2018.
Nuru, who resigned his post in February, also faces a second count of lying to the FBI on Jan. 27 after having initially cooperated with the corruption investigation.
Bovis pleaded guilty in May to one count of honest services wire fraud and one count of using a wire communication to carry out the fraud and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

September 15, 2020
Local commercial eviction moratorium can only be extended if State Executive Order is extended beyond September 30
San Francisco, CA — Today, Mayor London N. Breed issued the following statement regarding San Francisco's local commercial eviction protections. Local governments do not normally have control over commercial leases because those rules are governed by state law, but Governor Newsom issued an Executive Order in March, which allowed local governments to put in place commercial eviction moratoriums. San Francisco immediately enacted a commercial eviction moratorium for small and medium-sized businesses, which has helped to stabilize thousands of small businesses during the COVID pandemic.
Governor Newsom's Executive Order is set to expire at the end of September, and if the protections are not extended, San Francisco will no longer have the ability to prevent commercial evictions.
""Our small businesses have been struggling for months, and even as we are reopening, these businesses are barely getting by. We need to do everything we can to keep our businesses stable and our commercial corridors from seeing even more vacancies. Our local commercial eviction moratorium has been critical in providing small businesses an assurance that they can navigate these really challenging times without fear that they will be evicted because they can't make rent. It has given businesses time to work with landlords and property owners on rent payments as they wait to generate income.
Governor Newsom's initial Executive Order allowing us to protect our small businesses in San Francisco was incredibly important. He has been a leader on this issue from the very start of the pandemic, which has helped our small businesses and employees through incredibly challenging circumstances. We are hopeful we can find a way to extend eviction protections and financial support for these businesses beyond September 30. The virus has not gone away, and our economy has not yet recovered. Without these protections, it will take us even longer for our economy to recover. We need this extension in the next two weeks to help support our small businesses.""
Background on San Francisco's Commercial Eviction Moratorium
In March of this year, Mayor Breed announced a commercial evictions moratorium for small and medium sized businesses that can't keep up with their rent for reasons related to financial impacts caused by COVID-19. The moratorium prevents any small to medium-sized business from being evicted due to a loss of income related to lost revenue or other economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Governor's Executive Order on commercial evictions during the health pandemic, originally announced in March of this year (N-28-20), has been reducing the spread of COVID-19 and helping to stabilize the state's economy. The Governor extended these protections via a follow-up Executive Order (N-71-20) that is in place until the end of September. These state orders allowed local governments like San Francisco to put in place eviction controls for small businesses. If the orders are not extended, those powers for local governments go away.

45 Community Hubs opened their doors today to approximately 800 children and youth; Mayor Breed's annual backpack giveaway is providing 3,000 backpacks with school supplies to San Francisco students
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, Department of Children, Youth and Their Families Director Maria Su, and Recreation and Park Department General Manager Phil Ginsburg today launched the Community Hubs Initiative, which provide in-person support for distance learning and out of school time activities for San Francisco's highest needs children and youth throughout the City. The new initiative will roll out in phases, including today's launch of 45 Hubs. Mayor Breed's annual Backpack and School Supplies Giveaway will also continue its ongoing distribution of back-to-school items at the Community Hubs.
""We created the Community Hubs to make sure our City's children and youth who are most vulnerable continue to have the support and resources they need to learn, grow, and thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Mayor Breed. ""I'm excited that we started the program today so that we can serve kids and families who need extra support—whether it's help with distance learning, access to healthy food, or a place to safely interact with other kids their age. We knew it would take a village to get our young people the support and education they need, and City departments and our community partners have stepped up and worked together to turn our vision for the Community Hubs into reality. I want to thank DCYF, the Recreation and Park Department, the Library, and our community partners for creating this innovative solution for San Francisco students.""
The 45 Hubs launched today will serve approximately 800 K-6th grade students. San Francisco will continue to roll-out the Community Hubs Initiative over the coming weeks, and by mid-November, the City will launch over 100 Hub sites, providing approximately 3,000 students with full-day, in-person programming and distance learning support. The Community Hubs will help children and youth access technology for distance learning and provide additional enrichment programming including STEAM, literacy, and nature-based outdoor play and education. Offering social-emotional support services, three healthy meals and snack a day, and recreation and physical activities, the Hubs provide safe and digitally connected spaces within walking distance from children's homes that will be staffed by Recreation and Parks Department employees and community-based organization providers with strong track records of implementing high-quality youth development and culturally competent programming.
""The Community Hubs Initiative was designed to support children and youth who have the absolute highest level of needs,"" said Maria Su, DCYF Director. ""As with anything COVID related, we experienced many challenges in getting this Initiative off the ground from frequent changes of health guidance and restrictions to San Francisco being placed on the State's monitoring list and more recently, the allowance for schools to reopen. Despite these rollercoaster of changes, DCYF has remained both responsive and firmly focused on our highest need youth. These Hubs will give our City's most disconnected families a safe resource to support their children's learning and well-being. We are absolutely committed to empowering our most vulnerable families who do not often experience the benefit of having options and choices.""
DCYF worked closely with City partners including the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), HOPE SF, Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOCHD), the Recreation and Parks Department (RPD) and the Human Services Agency (HSA) to conduct direct, in-person outreach to our City's historically disconnected communities. The first wave of focused outreach prioritized the following groups of children and youth: residents of HOPE SF sites, public housing, family RVs parks and Single Room Occupancy Hotels (SROs); families experiencing homelessness; children in the foster care system; English language learners; and low-income families, with a focus on historically impacted communities, including people who identify as African American, Latino/a/x, Pacific Islander, and/or Asian. Higher enrollment priority was provided for families who are involved in multi-social service systems, are part of multiple priority populations, and families who are without Internet access or digital learning devices at home.
Mayor Breed's annual Backpack and School Supply Giveaway is underway with the distribution of backpacks and school supplies to 3,000 San Francisco students at Community Hubs. The backpacks include supplies like notebooks, pencils, folders, and art supplies, for students to use as they participate in distance learning either at home or from a Community Hub. This year's backpack giveaway is funded by the City's Give2SF COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.
""The fact of the matter is that the pandemic exposed what we knew before shelter in place — that community-based education supports are as fundamental to the health and well-being of San Franciscans as food and shelter,"" said Theo Miller, HOPE SF Director in the Office of the Mayor. ""Through the Community Hub Initiative, our communities have shown their extraordinary resilience and innovation, partnering with the City and residents in ways that beat back the effects of this virus on educational access, give us hope for our futures, and strengthen our neighborhoods for the long haul.""
In addition to the Community Hubs, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department recently launched Emergency Child and Youth Care spaces at five recreation centers to serve the children of healthcare workers and City employees serving as Disaster Service Workers. Programming began on August 31st at the Glen Park, Richmond, Sunset, Hamilton, and Potrero Hill recreation centers.
""Starting on day one of the stay at home order, we have provided kids safe, fun ways to play and given parents piece of mind—be it through emergency child care or summer camps,"" said Phil Ginsburg, General Manager of the Recreation and Parks Department. ""We are so proud to be a part of giving San Francisco kids support, joy and a sense of normalcy.""
In accordance with recent state and local public health guidance, the Hubs will host up to three cohorts of 14 children at over 100 sites throughout the city. Hub sites include recreation centers, branch libraries, churches, cultural centers, and several community-based organization sites. The Hubs are designed to keep students and staff safe; each location will operate under a City-approved Health and Safety Plan and will follow all masking and social distancing requirements. All staff members will have access to regular COVID-19 testing.

The Abundant Birth Project is the first program of its kind in the country, and will study the health impacts of providing people with targeted supplemental income during pregnancy and for six months postpartum
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, in partnership with Expecting Justice, today announced the launch of the Abundant Birth Project, a pilot program that provides targeted basic income to women during pregnancy and after giving birth. The pilot will provide an unconditional monthly income supplement of $1,000 to approximately 150 Black and Pacific Islander women in San Francisco for the duration of their pregnancy and for the first six months of their baby's life, with a goal of eventually providing a supplement for up to two years post-pregnancy. Expecting Justice, a collective impact initiative led by Dr. Zea Malawa at the San Francisco Department of Public Health and supported by the Hellman Foundation and the UCSF California Preterm Birth Initiative, will study the resulting health impacts of the pilot program, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
The Abundant Birth Project is a simple, yet novel, approach to achieving better maternal health and birthing outcomes: provide pregnant Black and Pacific Islander women a monthly income supplement for the duration of their pregnancy and during the postpartum period as an economic and reproductive health intervention. Prematurity is a leading cause of infant mortality and has been linked to lifelong conditions, such as behavioral development issues, learning difficulties, and chronic disease. In San Francisco, Black infants are almost twice as likely to be born prematurely compared with White infants (13.8% versus 7.3%, from 2012-2016) and Pacific Islander infants have the second-highest preterm birth rate (10.4%). Furthermore, Black families account for half of the maternal deaths and over 15% of infant deaths, despite representing only 4% of all births. Pacific Islander families face similar disparities.
""Providing guaranteed income support to mothers during pregnancy is an innovative and equitable approach that will ease some of the financial stress that all too often keeps women from being able to put their health first,"" said Mayor Breed. ""The Abundant Birth Project is rooted in racial justice and recognizes that Black and Pacific Islander mothers suffer disparate health impacts, in part because of the persistent wealth and income gap. Thanks to the work of the many partners involved, we are taking real action to end these disparities and are empowering mothers with the resources they need to have healthy pregnancies and births.""
The project is a fully funded public-private partnership designed under the collaborative change model, a process which directly involves all impacted and interested parties in decision-making. The Abundant Birth Project entered its design phase after receiving a Hellman Collaborative Change Initiative grant from the Hellman Foundation, and has since gone on to also receive an award of $1.1 million from Jack Dorsey's #startsmall campaign, $200,000 from Genentech, and $200,000 from the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Additional funders include California Preterm Birth Initiative at UCSF, WKKF (Kellogg Foundation), San Francisco Health Plan, Tipping Point, Economic Security Project, Walter and Elise Haas, San Francisco Foundation, and Friedman Family Foundation.
""Structural racism, which has left Black and Pacific Islander communities particularly exposed to COVID-19, also threatens the lives of Black and PI mothers and babies,"" said Dr. Zea Malawa. ""Providing direct, unconditional cash aid is a restorative step that not only demonstrates trust in women to make the right choices for themselves and their families, but could also decrease the underlying stress of financial insecurity that may be contributing to the high rates of premature birth in these communities. It is exciting to be in a city that not only calls out racism as a problem, but also takes steps to heal the wounds left by decades of injustice and anti-Black sentiment.""
""San Francisco has seen lasting health disparities in the Black and Pacific Islander communities, which we cannot allow to continue,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. ""The Abundant Birth Project addresses those disparities in a positive and active way, to directly benefit expecting mothers and their babies in those communities.""
One theory for these unacceptable disparities is the growing racial wealth gap in San Francisco. Even before the pandemic, Black and Pacific Islander families faced some of the greatest degrees of income inequality in San Francisco. The median annual household income for Black and Pacific Islander families in San Francisco is close to $30,000 and $67,000 respectively, compared with over $104,000 citywide.
The Abundant Birth Project will work with local prenatal care providers and the City's own network of pregnancy support services to identify and enroll eligible clients over the next two years. The project will target low-income and middle-income pregnant people with the income supplement given the high cost of living in San Francisco.
The community itself was involved at every phase of development of the Abundant Birth Project program. Black and Pacific Islander mothers were part of the design team and have been recruited and trained as community researchers to engage pregnant mothers and women with children to obtain accurate on-the-ground data about the actual needs of potential participants.
""The Abundant Birth Project is exactly the kind of innovative, community-driven social policy solution that the Hellman Collaborative Change Initiative was designed to support,"" said Susan Hirsch, Executive Director of the Hellman Foundation. ""When we made the first grant to this project a year ago, we did so cognizant of the fact that Black and Pacific Islander mothers have long faced structural racism that impacts the ability to have healthy birth outcomes, and that for too long those concerns went unaddressed by those in power. What we never could have imagined was how the current pandemic would rip open a chasm within our society and make clear exactly why we all must listen to those with lived experiences — the very people who have been sounding the alarm and providing cogent and restorative solutions all along. It is our responsibility not just as a donor community but as human beings to listen to one another, to encourage others to do the same, and to partner with local government to address seemingly intractable problems that are the consequences of years of inequality.""
""Despite decades of research and investment in clinical and behavioral interventions, the racial inequities in preterm birth persist, with Black and PI pregnant people the most affected in San Francisco,"" said Dr. Larry Rand, Principal Investigator of the UCSF Preterm Birth Initiative, funded by Marc and Lynne Benioff. ""So, it's crucial that we focus our efforts on developing more upstream interventions like the Abundant Birth Project to really turn the curve on the preterm birth epidemic. We feel very fortunate to be a partner in this truly innovative project and in a city that is supportive of research that is rooted community wisdom and racial justice. By improving outcomes for those who experience the worst outcomes, we can improve outcomes for all pregnant people.""
""Two years ago as Supervisor, I helped launch a citywide doula program in partnership with Expecting Justice and DPH,"" said Malia Cohen, member of the California State Board of Equalization and San Francisco Police Commissioner. ""This work left a tremendous impact on my personal life. I recently gave birth outside of a hospital with support from a dedicated team of midwives and doulas. The Abundant Birth Project is a smart, groundbreaking proposal that will enrich childbirth for so many, helping pregnant women and new mothers navigate an extremely delicate moment in life. I'm so proud of the hard work and collaboration that brought us to this point and I am hopeful that this caring approach to benefits distribution will substantively reduce the financial burden associated with birth and help us to increase positive birth outcomes for mother and baby.""
Led by Expecting Justice, a Black-led Birth Justice initiative based in the San Francisco Department of Public Health grounded in the principles of collective impact, the Abundant Birth Project is a collaboration between the Department of Public Health, the California Preterm Birth Initiative at UCSF, UC Berkeley School of Social Welfare, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, the San Francisco Treasurer's Office, the San Francisco Human Services Agency, and First 5 San Francisco.
Expecting Justice
Expecting Justice is taking an innovative, multicomponent approach to reduce the astonishing rates of preterm birth and infant mortality among Black and Pacific Islander communities. Using a racial equity framework, the approach includes a focus on increasing access to community doula care, increasing economic access in Black and Pacific communities, and anti-racism promotion within San Francisco's programs, services and institutions.
Hellman Foundation's Collaborative Change Initiative
The Collaborative Change Initiative was created to honor legendary philanthropist Warren Hellman. His tenacious, pragmatic and creative approach to collaborative change brought diverse stakeholders together to roll up their sleeves and tackle tough local challenges. The initiative also reflects the priorities of the current Hellman Foundation leaders, who are driven by an agenda for fairness and justice for Bay Area communities and believe in the power of collaboration as a strategy to impact these goals. Since 2014, the Hellman Collaborative Change Initiative has awarded close to $5.5M to enable collaborations in Alameda and San Francisco Counties to scale exciting solutions and impact systems, tackling disparities in health, education and opportunity.
UCSF California Preterm Birth Initiative (PTBI)
The UCSF California Preterm Birth Initiative (PTBI) is a research enterprise whose mission is to eliminate racial disparities in preterm birth and improve health outcomes for babies born too soon through research, partnerships and education grounded in community wisdom. PTBI conducts and funds transdisciplinary research to identify promising interventions that can turn the curve on the preterm birth epidemic and create positive change for Black and brown families. Funded by Lynne and Marc Benioff, PTBI asserts structural and interpersonal racism along with other key social determinants are important drivers of an epidemic that disproportionately affects women of color in our state, and nationally.

Indoor personal services and indoor gyms and fitness centers with limited capacity, hotels, and other lower risk indoor and outdoor activities will move forward on Monday, September 14
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health, and Assessor-Recorder Carmen Chu, co-Chair of the City's Economic Recovery Task Force, today announced San Francisco is moving forward with additional reopening on Monday, September 14. In addition to previously announced businesses and activities planned for mid-September, indoor personal services with limited capacity and indoor gyms with limited capacity will also be opening this coming Monday.
""I'm so glad we can move forward earlier than expected to reopen more businesses that have been closed since March. These businesses have been struggling, and starting Monday, they'll finally be able to serve customers again, with the necessary safety precautions and modifications in place,"" said Mayor Breed. ""It's on all of us to keep doing our part so that we can get more businesses reopened, get our kids back in school, and keep making progress on our economic recovery. Wearing face coverings when you go out, keeping your distance, and washing your hands will help us keep the rate of transmission down and will help San Francisco recover from this pandemic.""
San Francisco's resumed reopening started on September 1 and will continue on Monday, September 14 with additional outdoor and indoor activities, including services that are opening earlier than the City previously announced. The businesses and services that will resume indoors with limited capacity include hair salons, barber shops, massage services, nail salons, gyms and fitness centers with limited capacity. Only those services where face coverings can be worn at all times by everyone involved will reopen at this time.
As previously announced, hotels, outdoor family entertainment centers, drive-in entertainment like outdoor movies, and outdoor tour buses and boats will also reopen on the 14th under rules for outdoor gatherings. Indoor museums and galleries may submit health and safety plans the week of September 14th and will be able to open as early as September 21st following submission of their plan to the Department of Public Health. Additional services, businesses, and activities will resume over the coming weeks and months as long as San Francisco continues to make progress on limiting the spread of COVID-19.
On Monday, September 14, Community Hubs will open in San Francisco to support students with distance learning. Given San Francisco's recent success in slowing transmission, in-person learning and child and youth development activities will also be opened on a rolling basis. The goal is for in-classroom learning to resume on a rolling basis, starting with the youngest children, for whom distance learning has been the most challenging. The City anticipates in classroom learning with limited capacity for TK-6th grade will begin to resume September 21st for schools that have submitted a safety plan and have received approval. Other child and youth development activities are underway, including after-school programs and childcare facilities.
On Friday, August 28, the State issued new criteria and a colored-coded tiered system, which replaced the watch list. San Francisco was placed on the ""red"" tier, which provides the City the discretion to move forward with reopening some activities, including the activities that will resume on Monday. While San Francisco recognizes the State's thresholds, the City will continue on a reopening path based on its local health indicators and unique challenges and successes, and maintains the ability to open more gradually than what the State allows.
To support a safer reopening, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development is coordinating the distribution of free personal protective equipment for San Francisco's small businesses. Small businesses that would like to request a 30-day supply of hand sanitizer, surgical masks, and face shields should coordinate with their nearest participating community-based organization. Program details and availability can be found online here.
""Given our local trend in COVID indicators, low-risk, limited capacity indoor activities may resume,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We will continue our gradual reopening as it allows us to monitor the spread, manage its immediate challenges and mitigate the long-term impact on our city. Our reopening pace continue to be informed by our ability to manage the risk of more activity that may result in more cases and hospitalizations. Our success is contingent on everyone doing their part, including wearing face coverings, social distancing, and avoid large gatherings.""
""Our hairdressers, barbershops, nail salons, and gyms haven't been able to operate indoor for months and workers and business owners have shared the real urgency to reopen,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, Co-Chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""Today's announcement makes it possible for businesses to begin to rebuild.""
""Today, as we prepare to reopen additional businesses indoors for the first time in months, it's important to remember that our progress is not automatic or inevitable,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""In June, we had to pause our reopening due to an alarming uptick in spread of the virus. Today, we're able to move forward again, for the second time in less than a month, thanks to the personal sacrifices of so many San Franciscans to slow the spread. Let's honor those sacrifices by continuing to do what's necessary to stop this virus and keep reopening. Our small businesses are counting on us.""
The gradual reopening of businesses and activities will increase travel and interaction throughout the city, which means increasing community spread of the virus and an increase in cases. Public health officials will regularly assess the Key Public Health Indicators, particularly new positive case counts and hospitalizations to ensure San Francisco has the necessary resources available for those that are infected.
San Francisco's reopening plan is available online at SF.gov/reopening. Reopening is dependent upon San Francisco's Health indicators remaining stable or improving, and the plan is subject to change. All San Franciscans must do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19, including face masking, social distancing and handwashing. The reopening of most activities and businesses requires limited capacity and health and safety plans. San Francisco continues to evaluate ways to bring higher risk activities, including indoor movies, dining, bars, night life, and offices back safely.
San Francisco's Path Forward to Reopening
Monday, September 14 – Low Risk Outdoor and Indoor Activities
September 21 – Indoor Museums, Zoos, and Aquariums and TK-6th grade in-person learning
GOAL: End of September, Low Risk Indoor Activities
GOAL: October, Middle School in-person learning
GOAL: November, High Schools, additional learning activities

San Francisco's 2019 HIV Epidemiology Report includes promising trends, but more work is needed to support vulnerable populations that are still disproportionately affected. Health officials urge people to continue seeking HIV prevention and treatment services during the COVID-19 pandemic
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health, today announced the results of the 2019 Annual HIV Epidemiology Report by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH). The report shows another year of improvement in new HIV diagnoses and care outcomes and includes new data and analysis to further understand the disparities of some vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by higher HIV diagnosis rates and poorer health outcomes.
New HIV diagnoses in San Francisco declined to a record-low of 166 in 2019. The 19% decrease in new diagnoses since 2018 shows a positive trend towards achieving San Francisco's goal of zero new HIV infections. This represents a 65% decline since 2012, compared with nearly level values nationally. Moreover, the City made significant headway with HIV care outcomes. Ninety five percent of new diagnoses were linked to care within one month, and 78% of new diagnoses were virally suppressed within six months after diagnosis. The recent declines in new diagnoses included declines among Black/African Americans, Latinx, people who inject drugs, and people experiencing homelessness.
""We are seeing encouraging trends on many fronts towards achieving San Francisco's goal of zero new HIV infections, but we can't let up on our efforts to address disparities and ensure people get the care and treatment they need,"" said Mayor Breed. ""San Francisco has always been and will continue to be the leader of HIV/AIDS care and prevention. The City's health care experts and community partners are continuing their efforts to decrease disparities among populations and improve HIV care for everyone in our City.""
Despite the progress that San Francisco continues to make in reducing the number of new HIV diagnoses and improving care outcomes, disparities that were observed in previous years still exist. While the total number of new diagnoses and rates of diagnosis declined for Black/African Americans and Latinx people, the diagnosis rates for Black/African American and Latinx men and women were still higher than the rates for White and Asian and Pacific Islander men and women. Among people living with HIV, approximately 75% are virally suppressed, however viral suppression was lower for people experiencing homelessness (39%) and for people who inject drugs (66%).
The 2019 report features new data tables that display information about HIV diagnosis rates by poverty, income, and education level. The report reveals that HIV diagnosis rates were higher among persons living in census tracts that had high percentages of people below the federal poverty level, a higher percentage of people with less than a high school education, and lower median household incomes.
""San Francisco continues to make remarkable progress toward our goal of getting to zero new HIV infections,"" said Supervisor Rafael Mandelman. ""We should be proud of our Department of Public Health and our many incredible non-profit partners for their work to achieve this milestone. One new HIV diagnosis is still one too many and we must remain committed to addressing disparities in new infections and viral suppression among our most vulnerable communities.""
""While the 2019 numbers make our progress in eliminating new HIV diagnoses look promising, the ongoing disparities and gaps revealed by the data tells us much more work still needs to be done,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We will do so by focusing on equity and by working together with our community partners, scientists, academics, providers and the City's leaders. I am committed to combining our efforts to ensure that all San Francisco communities have access to HIV prevention and care that works for them and be the first city to Get to Zero.""
In 2014, San Francisco City agencies, researchers, providers, community-based organizations and activists came together in a collective impact initiative known as Getting to Zero. There are several efforts underway to address the disparities highlighted by race and ethnicity, age, gender, housing status, and risk group. In 2019, DPH received a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a plan to achieve the goal of ending new HIV infections by 2030. In partnership with community-based organizations and existing initiatives, including the HIV Community Planning Council, the Getting to Zero Consortium, and End Hep C SF, DPH is developing the San Francisco Ending the HIV/HCV/STI Epidemics plan. The plan will address overlapping vulnerabilities, health disparities and inequities with all communities by integrating a person-centered, harm reduction-based, and low-barrier services approach. Under this collaborative effort, the plan will help San Francisco reach its goal of getting to and stay at zero new HIV infections, zero HIV-related deaths, and zero stigma.
In January 2019, Ward 86 at San Francisco General Hospital launched a new medical program that provides flexible, comprehensive and patient-centered care. The POP-UP (Positive-health Onsite Program for Unstably-housed Populations) program provides low-barrier care for patients who are not virally suppressed and require urgent care or other drop-in needs and has now provided services to about 100 patients with HIV and who are experiencing homelessness. DPH has funded community-based organizations to provide pre-exposure prophylaxis services to African Americans, Latinx, transgender persons, and youth.
""Getting to Zero is pleased, but not satisfied with the reduction in cases,"" said Dr. Diane Havlir, co-chair of Getting to Zero. ""We still had over 160 new HIV diagnosis and over 70 HIV-related deaths due to AIDS, which never should happen if persons are diagnosed and treated early. Innovative and multi-sector approaches are needed for HIV prevention and treatment that reach communities of color and youth.""
While the City focuses on further improving linkage and retention in care and enhanced patient outreach, health officials urge people to help make sure the City does not lose its momentum gained from the past few years by continuing to seek HIV prevention and treatment services. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has added significant new challenges in managing the HIV epidemic due to reduced HIV testing and care utilization. DPH is working on guidance about how to conduct HIV and STI testing and services most safely for patients and providers. Meanwhile, as the City gradually reopens, HIV providers and services are dedicated to ensuring their adjusted protocols and procedures are in alignment with COVID-19 safety and prevention measures.
""It is more important now than ever to let people know they should still be seeking HIV prevention and care services,"" said Dr. Susan Buchbinder, Director of Bridge HIV at the Department of Public Health. ""These are essential services, and clinics and community-based organizations have built in safeguards to protect the health and well-being of clients and workers.""
The new 2019 HIV annual report can be found online here. The report will be presented to the San Francisco Health Commission on Tuesday, October 6 at 4:00pm.

September 08, 2020
The Steering Committee, guided by the Human Rights Commission, will help the City research and develop alternative responses to calls regarding homelessness and behavioral health, like the City's newly announced Street Crisis Response Teams
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the formation of a Steering Committee to help guide the City's process for identifying alternatives to police response for non-violent calls to 911 and 311. Ending the use of police as first responders to situations that involve behavioral health and or homelessness and other non-violent calls is part of the Mayor's roadmap to fundamentally changing the way that the City handles public safety, which Mayor Breed announced in June.
The Steering Committee is composed of community members and representatives of organizations that work on behavioral health and homelessness, including Hospitality House, GLIDE, San Francisco AIDS Foundation, Urban Alchemy, Street Violence Intervention Program, At the Crossroads, Metta Fund, and HealthRight360. These organizations were selected because of their commitment to centering community voices, willingness to challenge the status quo, and their dedication to exploring innovative and outcome-driven practices. The Steering Committee also has representatives from City agencies, including the Department of Public Health, Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, San Francisco Police Department, San Francisco Fire Department, and Department of Emergency Management.
""To address the structural inequities that too many in our City experience, in particular our African-American community, we need fundamental change and reinvestments. There is a better, more effective way to handle these calls for service that will help people who are in crisis,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Working to divert non-violent calls for service away from a law enforcement-based response is a profound change in how we as a City respond when someone calls for assistance. It's a key part of addressing our structural inequities, but it's going to take work and it's going to take time. This Steering Committee will play an important role in designing other models of response, and getting us to a place where we are making real, concrete change, including in future budget investments.""
""Across the country, there are calls to reimagine policing, this Steering Committee represents an opportunity to create a more just and truly responsive system,"" said Sheryl Davis, Executive Director, San Francisco Human Rights Commission. ""This is the beginning of a process to address the system failures and inequities disproportionately experienced by people of color and people in crisis. I look forward to hearing from those directly impacted, learning from the Steering Committee and hearing the alternatives created, informed, supported and led by community.""
In an important step toward diverting non-violent calls from the Police Department and at Mayor Breed's direction, the San Francisco Human Rights Commission (HRC) has convened an Alternatives to Policing Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will explore strategies and alternatives to policing, such as the Street Crisis Response Teams, and will offer recommendations to Mayor Breed about how to effectively transition those types of calls for service that are currently going to the police to other entities.
In August, Mayor Breed announced a plan to create a Street Crisis Response Team pilot program, which would begin the effort to fundamentally change the way San Francisco responds to 911 and 311 calls regarding behavioral health emergencies. The Mayor's proposed budget for Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 includes $4 million from the General Fund to pilot a Street Crisis Response Team to help San Franciscans who are experiencing behavioral health crises. If the consensus Business Tax Reform ballot measure passes in November, Proposition C revenues will enable the City to direct a total of approximately $18.5 million to the pilot program over two years, which would expand the program and create additional Street Crisis Response Teams.
The Steering Committee's discussions will be guided by the Human Rights Commission, along with the support of a professional facilitator. The Steering Committee had their first informational meeting earlier this month, and their first official meeting will be on Wednesday, September 16. The goal of the committee is to develop recommendations that can be included in the Fiscal Year 2021-22 budget process, which begins the Mayor's issuance of budget instructions in December 2020.
Identifying and implementing appropriate alternative responses to police is a complex process and requires input from a variety of stakeholders. Each of the members of the Steering Committee have a history of working with diverse stakeholders and will collect input from a wide array of community members. HRC was selected to handle this complex process because of their experience and success convening other challenging conversations that engage the community as well as City staff, such as ongoing discussions about reparations and reinvestment of law enforcement dollars into the African-American community.
""Alternative policing does not mean that poor people will police other poor people – we reject that. We can build the community capacity that doesn't exist yet, and invest in existing efforts that have struggled far too long with far too little to lift up the best of what our communities can be,"" said Joseph Wilson, Executive Director, Hospitality House. ""This is our charge – we have to first climb the mountain to get to the valley beyond it. We know it's there.""
""I look forward to exploring how to utilize the Street Violence Intervention Program to support de-escalation, conflict mediation, violence intervention in the communities as well as the middle and high schools impacted by violence,"" said Arturo Carrillo, Director, Street Violence Intervention Program. ""We need to prioritize providing opportunities for job readiness and employment but also focus on the root causes that can help make behavioral change in preparation for job readiness. I hope through this process we develop a plan for Community Policing not from a SFPD perspective, but from within the communities themselves.""
""I am honored and humbled to be a part of this team of creative and thoughtful individuals who are in the process of designing trauma informed responses to our community members who are experiencing a moment or longer periods of crises,"" said Lena Miller, Chief Executive Officer, Urban Alchemy. ""Society has changed and presents new challenges to the way we must respond to our citizens, particularly in light of the overwhelming presence of trauma, mental illness, and addiction that is on constant display on the streets of our major cities. Now is the time for the social innovators to create the blueprint for a more peaceful and just society for all people. I am grateful for the courage and leadership of Mayor Breed to ensure that San Francisco is at the forefront of this movement with substantive and practical steps to operationalize these values.""
""Much historical data and personal experiences of formerly incarcerated people has shown we must change our own public safety beliefs and investments regarding arresting for ""corrective"" punishment and practices of incarceration. Real public safety means we, must use our public tax dollars to invest in our poorest, our schools, public health, affordable housing, employment and businesses,"" said Roma Guy, Metta Fund. ""Current community and leadership, elected and appointed, inspired by Black Lives Matter and criminal justice reform advocacy, has led to closing two jails at Hall of Justice, releasing and referring more prisoners to pretrial, improving jail health services and placements. Legislation such as free phone calls for the imprisoned, passage of Mental Health SF and expansion of harm reduction drug practices are examples of our early successes. The task and public responsibility of the Steering Committee is to remove 911 and 311 calls from police and establish a civilian Street Crisis Response Team. These are our beginnings. It will take all of us to continue this path for our true and equitable public safety.""

""I'm excited and proud to nominate Manny to serve on the SFMTA Board of Directors,"" said Mayor Breed. ""I am confident in his ability to bring a fresh perspective to the Board and represent the needs of San Francisco small businesses and residents alike. Manny knows how to bring people together and make sure everyone has a chance to share their diverse perspectives. He's a regular rider of public transportation in our City, and understands how critical Muni is to everyone in our City, especially our workers. In response to COVID, Manny has played a huge role in transforming Valencia Street into a space that supports our residents and helps businesses thrive, and I know he will bring that same energy and commitment to the Board.""
""I am deeply humbled and honored to be considered to serve the City I love as a member of the board of the SFMTA,"" said Manny Yekutiel. ""Mobility is freedom and it's my belief that a City like ours should aim to create access to that freedom to everyone, everywhere. Our transportation system can and should do that. The relationship between our transport system, streets, workers, and small businesses has never been more important. I've seen first-hand how decisions made by the SFMTA, in the case of temporarily closing streets to cars, has given small businesses a fighting chance to survive this crisis. If given the opportunity to serve, I promise to be a fierce advocate for all San Franciscans and will bring my perspective and my passion as a small business owner to the Board.""
Manny's is known for its civic events space and engaging conversations on a range of topics.

The Valencia Corridor Merchants Association worked with the City to close Valencia Street as part of the Shared Spaces program, an initiative created by Mayor Breed to help neighborhood businesses to share a portion of the public right-of-way for outdoor dining and other neighborhood retail activity. Manny also served on the SFMTA 16th Street Bus Improvement Project Mitigation Task Force.
""Manny would finally be the fierce advocate small businesses need to represent us on the board of the SFMTA,"" said William Ortiz-Cartagena, Small Business Commissioner. ""Not only does he see things from a small business owner perspective being a small business owner himself, everything Manny does and lives is through a lens of equity.""
""Manny is an extraordinary leader who understands the importance of working within the community, for the community,"" said Gina Fromer, CEO of Children's Council of San Francisco. ""He is someone who breaks down barriers for the greater good of San Francisco by bringing all of the various micro-communities together to think critically about the state of the city and beyond.""
Yekutiel was raised in Los Angeles. He comes from a long line of small business owners; his grandparents owned a grocery store in Brooklyn and his father, who emigrated from Afghanistan, had a small business in Southern California selling tablecloths. Yekutiel is a graduate of Williams College, and was a public engagement intern focusing on the LGBTQ and Tribal communities under the Obama Administration. He currently lives in the Castro District in San Francisco.

Gavin Newsom named Martin Jenkins Monday to the California Supreme Court. The former prosecutor and judge would be the first openly gay man on the state's Supreme Court and the third Black man to serve on the state's highest court.

October 02, 2020
San Francisco, CA — Today, Mayor London N. Breed issued the following statement regarding her signing of San Francisco's $13.6 billion budget for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020-21 and $12.4 billion budget for FY 2021-22.
""There is much we can be proud of in the two-year budget I have just signed. We have funded our Homelessness Recovery Plan that will move thousands of people from the streets and shelter into housing, continued our progress on mental health reform by funding innovative solutions like our Street Crisis Response Teams to assist those who suffer from mental illness and addiction on our streets, and followed through on our commitment to address systemic racism by making an historic investment in the African-American community. We met these key City priorities while continuing to fund our nationally-leading response to COVID with over $450 million dedicated to testing, contact tracing, health support, food, temporary housing and shelter for our most vulnerable residents. We did all this while closing a $1.5 billion two-year deficit without laying off a single City worker. This was, without a doubt, the most challenging budget I've ever experienced putting together, and I'm proud of everyone who worked on it, from my Budget team to all the Departmental staff.
That does not mean, however, that this Budget is perfect. We had to make a lot of hard choices to not fund certain priorities that we all support, but that's part of balancing a budget in a recession. More so, the Board of Supervisors failed to make their own hard choice when they chose to fund pay raises for City employees.
I support our City workers, and it was critical to me that we not lay anyone off during this pandemic where over 200,000 San Francisco residents have already applied for unemployment. However, giving City workers pay raises at a time when so many people are suffering is irresponsible. Workers have lost hours at work and they have lost jobs. They are sitting at home with their families trying to figure out how they are going to pay their rent. Our small business owners have had to close their doors for good. How can we tell these residents who have lost so much that we are giving our workers raises?
The Board's irresponsibility lies not only in committing to pay these raises at a time when our residents and small businesses are suffering, but also in the fact that the raises are built on funding that doesn't even exist yet. These raises are contingent on a ballot measure passing in November -- a ballot measure that we were already relying on to help balance the significant general fund deficit we were facing without any raises. If that measure fails, then we will now not only need to find a new way to close our general fund gap, but we will have to find a new way to fund these raises. Despite the fact that this decision was made a month ago, the Board has not presented an alternative solution if that were to happen. No plan of what they will choose to cut. Of course, my office has been working on this, and it's not going to be easy. It will likely require service cuts and not funding certain programs that benefit our residents. That's the reality, and we have to be honest with the public.
So while I have signed the Budget, there is much more work to do. We know there will be changes to our revenue projections in the coming weeks, and that will change things, as will the outcome of the election. I'm committed to continuing to do the work, and make the hard choices. It's how San Francisco has led the way through this public health crisis, and it's how we will continue to get ourselves back on the road to recovery.""

Early voting in San Francisco will begin on October 5, with several options for voting including 588 polling places, ballot drop boxes, and a Voting Center in Civic Center
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced how San Franciscans can vote safely in the November 3, 2020 election and encouraged residents to have a plan for voting. Mayor Breed, the Department of Elections, and community leaders held a press conference today at San Francisco's outdoor Voting Center, located at 99 Grove Street, in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. The Voting Center is one of more than 588 locations in San Francisco where people can vote in the upcoming election.
""We want everyone to feel comfortable voting this November, which is why we have adapted our Voting Center and polling places to make sure San Franciscans still have a safe and accessible place to cast their ballot,"" said Mayor Breed. ""While voting in the November election will look mostly the same to voters as in years past, there are some differences because of this pandemic. First is the outdoor voting center on Civic Center Plaza instead of inside City Hall. Second, all registered voters will receive ballots in the mail, not just those who request them. But what hasn't changed is that every vote matters. Make your plan now for making sure your ballot gets in on time and is counted. And for those who haven't registered yet, you can register now online or at our Voting Center. So many have given so much to ensure that we all have the right to vote, so let's do our part by voting this November.""
""If you vote early in person or by mail, you will avoid possible wait times and crowded public spaces, and your ballot will be reviewed and counted well before Election Day,"" said John Arntz, Director, Department of Elections. ""Voters can track the status of their ballots using the Voter Portal on the Department's website and know when their ballots are counted.""
All registered voters in San Francisco and California will be sent a vote-by-mail ballot for the November 3, 2020 election, and should expect to receive their ballot in the mail the week of October 5. The deadline to register to vote is October 19, 2020. Register to vote online or in person at the Voting Center. Those who miss the voter registration deadline but are still eligible can visit the Voting Center or a polling place to register and cast a provisional ballot.
Over the last few months, the Department of Elections has been working diligently to safely reach voters and potential registrants with a wide range of multilingual, multi-format informational resources about the November 3 election. In collaboration with its non-profit outreach partners and City agencies, the Department is distributing digital presentations and print materials designed to inform all residents, including members of the City's vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations, about upcoming election dates and deadlines, vote by mail, and the new health and safety protocols implemented at in-person voting sites. The Department of Elections has also been informing the public about the November 3 election through several informational mailings, digital notices, and Public Service Announcements.
There are several ways to vote in the election:
Health and Safety Measures
In compliance with current guidance from public health officials, the Department of Elections has adopted several new health and safety protocols at its in-person voting locations. The Department will offer hand sanitizer, gloves, and facemasks to all voters and post notices asking voters and observers to observe health guidelines, including those regarding facial coverings, hand hygiene, and social distancing rules, at all in-person voting locations.
The Department will also introduce new sanitation and disinfection protocols for the voting supplies and equipment used at all in-person voting locations. The Voting Center and 588 polling places will be set up to maintain 6 foot distances between people in line, computer workstations, voting booths, and ballot return boxes. Although all voters will receive ballots by mail, voters can still use in-person services at the Voting Center or polling places. San Franciscans are reminded to wear a face covering when voting in person or dropping off their ballot to protect public health.
Voting Center
The Voting Center will provide ballots and services to all City residents who wish to pick up or drop off vote-by-mail ballots, register to vote (before or after the registration deadline), obtain personal assistance, use accessible voting equipment, obtain replacement ballots, or cast their ballots in person.
To protect the health of voters wishing to obtain in-person voting services during the 29-day early voting period, the Voting Center will be set up in the area outside of Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on 99 Grove Street, between Polk and Larkin Streets.
The Voting Center will be open during the 29-day early voting period during these times:
To make their voting experience faster and safer, voters can use the Voting Locations and Wait Times Tool to check wait times at the Voting Center as they are planning their trip. With early voting opportunities available 29 days before Election Day, San Francisco encourages residents to vote as early as possible.
The Voting Center will also offer accessible voting tools such as page magnifiers, pen grips, and seated voting, as well as accessible ballot-marking devices with touchscreen/audio format and personal assistive device compatibility. Any voter may request to vote ""curbside"" at the Voting Center by calling (415) 554-4375 or by asking a companion to enter the voting center to request delivery of voting materials to the voter.
""By voting, we voice out our opinions; we choose the person to represent us; we give the direction for our country!"" said George Chan, Executive Director, Chinese Newcomers Service Center. ""Please register now and vote in November.""
""This year, your vote will be one of the most important decisions you make. So get educated. Make a plan. And vote,"" said Jackie Flin, Executive Director, A. Phillip Randolph Institute San Francisco.

San Francisco's commercial eviction moratorium now applies to rent due from March 17, 2020 through November 30, 2020, prohibiting evictions for late rent payments on commercial properties
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today authorized a 60-day extension of the City's commercial eviction moratorium, from September 30 to November 30, 2020. Last week, Governor Gavin Newsom signed an Executive Order allowing local jurisdictions to continue banning evictions of commercial tenants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The City's ability to extend the moratorium beyond September 30 depended on the State taking this action. Mayor Breed and the Board of Supervisors, including Supervisor Aaron Peskin, strongly advocated for the State to extend the moratorium.
""Even as we work to reopen and help our economy recover, we know that businesses are barely hanging on. That's why we pushed for the ability to extend our local commercial eviction moratorium and why we're issuing a further extension through the end of November,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This gives businesses greater certainty and the ability to focus on safely reopening and getting back on their feet. I want to thank Governor Newsom for continuing to give local governments the ability to take these protective actions. We'll do everything we can to support and protect our small businesses as we make it through this pandemic together.""
""The Mayor's approach has been remarkably successful for San Francisco at large, and now it's incumbent upon us to do everything we can to ensure small businesses survive this pandemic,"" said Supervisor Peskin. ""For me and my colleagues who are fighting to revive our neighborhood commercial corridors, we now have some breathing room to ensure that everyone recovers.""
The Governor's Executive Order provides localities the ability to continue extending the commercial eviction moratorium as needed until the end of March 2021. Today's extension by Mayor Breed will provide businesses additional security through Thanksgiving, when a further extension of the moratorium may be implemented as needed. The extension comes as San Francisco is assigned to the State's Orange tier, and is moving forward on reopening more businesses, including restaurants indoors for the first time since March.
San Francisco's commercial eviction moratorium now applies to rent due from March 17, 2020 through November 30, 2020, prohibiting evictions for late rent payments. It does not waive the obligation to pay missed rent, and also provides a process for landlords to seek waivers from the moratorium by demonstrating significant financial hardship such as a default on debt or a similar enforceable obligation. The Mayor's Order also clarifies that no missed rent is due until the expiration of the moratorium. Tenants and landlords are encouraged to work out repayment plans that work for both parties.
The City is helping commercial tenants and landlords understand and comply with the moratorium, including providing legal assistance through City nonprofit partners. For questions about how to access support, or any other questions about the commercial eviction moratorium, tenants and landlords are encouraged to visit OEWD's COVID-19 website and contact the City's Small Business Assistance Center by email at: sfosb@sfgov.org, and by phone in English and Spanish at: 415-554-6134, and in Chinese at: 415-554-6407.

In addition, San Francisco will expand the capacity of outdoor places of worship, outdoor political demonstrations, and indoor malls, and will reopen additional family entertainment, hotel fitness centers, and more. These next steps come as the State assigned San Francisco to Orange on its tiered reopening system, based on San Francisco's COVID-19 infection and case rate.
San Francisco has also set a timeline for opening indoor movie theaters and outdoor playgrounds. Indoor movie theaters are slated to reopen at a limited capacity and with modifications on Wednesday, October 7, and public outdoor playgrounds are planned to open in mid-October, now that State restrictions have eased.
""We know this continues to be a challenging time with people struggling economically and emotionally. However, thanks to San Francisco's commitment to following public health guidance, we are seeing improvements in our numbers, which means we can continue to move forward with reopening,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Reopening indoor restaurants and houses of worship with limited capacity, and creating opportunities for families to safely enjoy outdoor entertainment are a good step on our road to recovery. We are committed to following the data and continuing reopening once our local health indicators demonstrate it is safe to do so. That said, the last thing we want to see is a spike in cases and a need to roll back all the progress we've made, so we all need to do our part. Please continue to follow the public health guidelines and participate in these activities responsibly so we can continue to move forward together.""
""This latest round of activities and re-openings is a result of the dedication and commitment of our residents and businesses. Our actions to limit the spread of the virus continue to pay off,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax. ""Since we came off the state watch list Sept. 1, we have kept a steady and gradual pace of reopening -- from after school programs and in-classroom learning to indoor personal services and restaurants. We want this to continue and we do not want any setbacks, so we will keep reminding the public to be diligent and wear a mask, physically distance and wash your hands.""
""Growing up I spent many weekends bussing and waiting on tables at our family restaurant. Today, I'm especially excited to see restaurants reopen indoor to create a lifeline during the colder fall and winter months,"" said Assessor Carmen Chu, Co-chair of the Economic Recovery Task Force. ""Together our actions got us to 'orange' so let's keep it going. Let's keep taking precautions to keep our workers and families safe.""
""San Francisco's world class restaurants create vibrant spaces for culture and community to thrive and remain absolutely vital to our economic recovery. They draw visitors from across the Bay and the globe, employ tens of thousands of diverse San Franciscans and generate billions in taxable sales,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Even as the crisis has impacted their industry, they've been persistently innovative to serve all of us, supporting their workers and those most vulnerable in our communities. Doing business indoors couldn't come at a better time as we approach the colder months, but we must do so safely. Keep your mask on when you are talking, especially to restaurant staff. This will allow us to stay safe and do what we do better than any other City, eat out often.""
Tomorrow, the San Francisco Department of Public Health will issue final health and safety guidelines for indoor dining, places of worship, and other activities to ensure the safest reopening possible. On Thursday, September 24, the Department of Public Health provided restaurants and places of worship with preliminary guidance to safely reopen with limited capacity and other modifications in place.
The reopening of businesses and activities will increase travel and interaction throughout the city, which means increasing community spread of the virus and an increase in cases. Public health officials will regularly assess the Key Public Health Indicators, particularly new positive case counts and hospitalizations to ensure San Francisco has the necessary resources available for those who contract COVID-19.
While San Francisco recognizes the State's thresholds, the City will continue on a reopening path based on its local health indicators and unique challenges and successes of our local reopening. San Francisco's reopening plan is available online at SF.gov/reopening. Reopening is dependent upon San Francisco's Health indicators remaining stable or improving, and the plan is subject to change. Although additional indoor activities are being allowed, it is important to remember that outdoor options remain safer. Seniors and those with COVID-19 risk factors should avoid indoor crowds. All San Franciscans must do their part to limit the spread of COVID-19, including face masking, social distancing, and handwashing.
Indoor Dining
Starting on Wednesday, September 30, restaurants and bars serving meals can reopen for indoor dining at 25% capacity, up to 100 people. Safety requirements for indoor dining are similar to the existing guidelines for outdoor dining. Face coverings must be worn by personnel and patrons at all times except when the patron is eating or drinking. That includes customers wearing a face covering when ordering, waiting for their order to arrive, or anytime staff is at their table. Restaurants are encouraged to use reservations to help ensure compliance with capacity limits. Under the new health guidance, restaurants must conduct a health check of patrons before they are seated. The health check requirement applies to both indoor and outdoor dining. Additional requirements and guidelines are available online here.
Places of Worship
Starting on Wednesday, September 30, places of worship can open indoors at 25% capacity, up to 100 people. Outdoor worship services will continue, now with up to 200 people, as long as there is sufficient space to allow for social distancing. Singing or chanting is not allowed indoors since choirs and singing indoors is a known source of COVID-19 spread. The place of worship must conduct a health check of patrons before they enter the facility. Face coverings are required at all times except for brief removal to consume food or drink if it is essential to a ritual or ceremony. Additional requirements and guidelines are available online here.
Additional Activities Resuming September 30th
In addition to indoor dining and places of worship, San Francisco is moving forward on reopening or expanding the following activities on September 30th:
GOAL: early October - Indoor Movie Theaters and Outdoor Playgrounds
""We are thrilled to welcome families back to our playgrounds, centers of neighborhood joy and connection that have been sorely missed, particularly in our low income and high density neighborhoods,"" said San Francisco Recreation and Park Department General Manager Phil Ginsburg. ""Opening the Observation Wheel for Golden Gate Park's 150th anniversary is a tribute to the resilience of San Franciscans, who have found healing and happiness in our parks throughout our history. The Wheel is a symbol of hope and celebration that connects our past with our future.""
Reopening of Schools - Ongoing
As state and local COVID-19 indicators permit, San Francisco schools may now resume in-person learning with approved safety plans in place. San Francisco's approach to the reopening process for San Francisco TK-12 schools (transitional kindergarten through 12th grade) prioritizes the reopening of younger grades for in-person learning this fall. As many as 106 private, parochial or charters schools have requested applications for in-person learning this fall. Almost 60 schools have submitted applications and 20 schools have been approved for re-opening. The applications are being reviewed on a rolling basis. Elementary schools are reopening first, followed by middle schools, and then high schools.
All San Francisco schools must meet minimum standards required by the state and DPH before resuming in-person learning. This includes providing detailed plans on how they will ensure adequate testing and contact tracing for their staff and students. Schools will work with DPH to meet all the requirements for the safest re-opening. The school re-opening dashboard identifies the schools that have begun this process by sending an initial letter of interest to DPH to reopen, and shows where each school is in the approval process, including completion of an on-site assessment.

Human Resources Director Micki Callahan is retiring from City government, and Carol Isen will assume role of Acting Director
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Human Resources Director Micki Callahan today announced a transition plan when Director Callahan retires from City government in October after 15 years of service, 13 as the Human Resources Director and two as the Employee Relations Director. This follows on Director Callahan's previous announcement in June that she was planning to retire in October. Current Employee Relations Director, Carol Isen, will serve as Acting Director of Human Resources while a comprehensive search for the Human Resources Director position is being undertaken by the Civil Service Commission. Amalia Martinez, currently an Employee Relations Manager, will serve as Acting Employee Relations Director.
""Micki Callahan has been an invaluable leader and public servant for the City,"" said Mayor Breed. ""San Francisco has been lucky to have her leadership during this most recent COVID crisis when our entire workforce has faced unprecedented uncertainty and challenges, as well as in the years going back to our last economic crisis when she led us through the Great Recession. Micki has spearheaded groundbreaking equity and social justice initiatives, and she has managed challenging negotiations and modernized our hiring system with a combination of determination and grace that has served our City well. I wish her all the best in her retirement.""
""It has been a pleasure to serve the City and County of San Francisco for the last 15 years, and to work on many transformative initiatives such as pension reform, the implementation of implicit bias training, and our conviction history program,"" said Micki Callahan, Human Resources Director. ""Carol Isen is an excellent choice to serve as Acting Human Resources Director and is well suited to work with all city departments, labor partners, and community stakeholders to continue to keep the San Francisco at the forefront of life-changing workforce policies.""
In her 15 years at the Department of Human Resources, Director Callahan was responsible for administration of the City's civil service system and human resources programs, including labor relations, workers compensation, workforce development, equal employment opportunity, and recruitment and assessment. She led negotiations during the 2008 great recession, and she led the bargaining process for pension and retiree health reform twice, in 2007 and 2011 and played a critical role in ensuring that medical benefits remain affordable for active employees and their families. She also launched a multi-year, multi-faceted Hiring Modernization Program.
Director Callahan spearheaded several initiatives focused on equity and social justice. She led the ""ban the box"" efforts for City hiring in San Francisco through the creation of a nationally recognized Conviction History program, implemented the City-wide Gender Inclusion Policy, and expanded training opportunities, notably overseeing the development and recent major expansion of Implicit Bias training. Under her direction, San Francisco is now the first major employer in the State of California to provide electronic payments of Workers' Compensation benefits.
Director Callahan has also served as San Francisco's Employee Relations Director. Before joining City management, she worked at the State Mediation and Conciliation Service for 10 years, serving as the Supervisor of Conciliation from 2000 through 2005. Before she became a mediator, she spent 14 years working as a union representative. Callahan received her BA in Economics from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
Since 2017, Carol Isen has served in the capacity of Employee Relations Director for the City and County of San Francisco.
""I want to thank Carol for stepping up to lead at this critical time for our city,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Carol brings a tireless work ethic and decades of experience working with labor and city workers across different departments and regional agencies. She has a deep understanding of the role labor relations and Human Resources play in ensuring our workplaces are safe, fair, and create equitable work opportunities. I know she is focused on meeting our goals of increasing diversity and supporting equity, and I look forward to working with her in this important role.""
""At such a pivotal time for our city, I am honored and humbled to continue to serve the City and County of San Francisco as the Acting Human Resources Director,"" said Carol Isen, Director of Employee Relations. ""The Department of Human Resources is uniquely positioned to tackle the bold, aspirational and, achievable goals of building and embracing a more diverse and inclusive workforce in which our employees at all levels reflect our communities and where our differences are celebrated and valued. Achieving these goals will only improve the delivery of high-quality services to the thousands of San Francisco residents that we serve each day. I am looking forward to leading a department that is focused on these ideals and works in collaboration with community partners to achieve them.""
Ms. Isen has been involved in labor and employment advocacy and representation in San Francisco government since 1984. From 1984 to 2003, Ms. Isen was an organizer, negotiator and Associate Director for the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), Local 21.

She has a deep commitment to civil rights in the workplace, merit system employment and promoting community development through job training and opportunities. She received her MA degree from the University of Michigan, Residential College, and her MA Degree from the University of California at Berkeley, Department of City and Regional Planning.
""Frontline public workers deserve fair and transparent leadership at the head of this important agency,"" said Rudy Gonzalez, Executive Director of the San Francisco Labor Council. ""Carol Isen's appointment brings experience and credibility to this important post. We also appreciate that Ms. Isen's appointment as an LGBTQ leader stands as a statement of inclusion and diversity for the City's workforce.""

The Entertainment Commission's JAM or ""Just Add Music"" permit will regulate entertainment and amplified sound at Shared Spaces locations, private business property, and other outdoor settings. Permit is available at no cost.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced a new temporary permit program to ensure safer outdoor entertainment and amplified sound activity as a part of San Francisco's gradual reopening. Administered by the Entertainment Commission, the new JAM or ""Just Add Music"" permit will help businesses, organizations, and individuals hold responsible entertainment activity at Shared Spaces and other outdoor locations consistent with public health rules.
Prior to this permit process, businesses that wanted to offer outdoor entertainment or amplified sound at their venue during the COVID-19 pandemic had to either apply for one-day permits—limited to 12 days a year at an expense of hundreds of dollars per day—or pursue a multi-month permitting process that could require an Entertainment Commission hearing. The JAM permit program provides a free and streamlined pathway for the arts, entertainment, and nightlife sectors to support their business livelihoods by adding music and other cultural activity in a way that is safe and follows public health guidelines. The JAM Permit application portal is available at sf.gov/jam.
""This program will provide some much-needed relief for businesses that are looking for ways to safely offer outdoor entertainment and music and survive the economic challenges of COVID-19,"" said Mayor Breed. ""San Francisco is a world-class entertainment city and we are fortunate to have a diverse entertainment and nightlife culture -- we can't let COVID take that away from us. We're adapting our permitting processes to meet this moment and ensure businesses have the guidance they need to operate safely and in compliance with City rules.""
The JAM permit comes at a pivotal time for San Francisco businesses, as arts, entertainment, and nightlife businesses are at risk of permanent closure or displacement due to the financial impacts of COVID-19. These businesses and employees have experienced devastating losses of income during the global pandemic. According to a May 2020 survey of 169 entertainment and nightlife industry workers conducted by the Entertainment Commission:
Given the uncertain course of the pandemic, these losses may continue until a vaccine is available and widely distributed. San Francisco continues to evaluate ways to bring activities, including indoor bars, music venues, performance spaces, and nightlife back safely, but these indoor activities currently remain closed. In the meantime, ensuring that outdoor cultural activity happens safely and in compliance with public health rules provides businesses with an opportunity for additional revenue and could help them survive.
""I am thrilled to launch this program as a part of San Francisco's safe reopening plans at a time when our beloved arts, entertainment and nightlife businesses need it most,"" said Maggie Weiland, Executive Director of the Entertainment Commission. ""The JAM Permit creates a legal pathway for businesses to hold responsible, vibrant entertainment activities--and supports their livelihoods and social well-being for all San Franciscans. Our permit holders are creators and curators of our City's culture, their contributions will amplify our City's values and resilience.""
""Arts and entertainment will be the main driver of San Francisco's economic and cultural recovery, not just a part of it,"" said Entertainment Commission President Ben Bleiman ""JAM permits are a crucial step for the survival of venues, artists, and performers across the city.""
""The recovery of our arts and entertainment sectors are critical to both our economy and our City's cultural fabric,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""The launch of this program represents a significant step in the City's safe reopening and creates more opportunities for our communities to enjoy what makes San Francisco hum with life. It's good for merchants, artists and entertainers who care deeply about enlivening our neighborhoods.""
""We're really excited for the JAM permit launch,"" said Aaron Paul, co-owner of Macondray, a bar and restaurant on Polk Street. ""I opened Macondray as a first time small business owner with my business partner Jake Roberts mere months before COVID happened. Over the past several months, we have had no option to move our music offerings outside. The JAM permit will allow us to add music to our outdoor Shared Space, while providing a vibrant and positive experience for our guests.""
""As the owner of Vesuvio in North Beach, I am very grateful the ""Just Add Music"" permit will allow us to program live music in Jack Kerouac Alley without a cumbersome or expensive bureaucratic process,"" said Janet Clyde, owner of Vesuvio. ""We look forward to working with our neighbors and the community of San Francisco musicians to make this program a success! Thank you Mayor Breed, Director Weiland, and everyone who made this possible!""
The JAM Permit aligns with and enhances the Shared Spaces program by creating a pathway for businesses to add safe, vibrant cultural activity to outdoor dining and retail spaces. Launched in June, Shared Spaces allows neighborhood businesses to share a portion of the public right-of-way, such as sidewalks, streets, or other nearby public or private spaces for dining and retail activity, as allowed by San Francisco's Public Health Order. The program allows individual businesses or local merchant associations to apply for a no-cost, expedited permit. The City has issued 1,600 Shared Spaces permits to date.
The San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH) will continue to monitor the spread of COVID-19 infection as more of the city population circulates and interacts. DPH will continue to monitor the City's Key Public Health Indicators to ensure San Francisco's gradual reopening and allowance of outdoor entertainment and amplified sound activity does not drive a surge in infections and hospitalizations.
The following locations and activities are eligible to apply for a permit:
Businesses with questions about the permit process should go to sf.gov/jam and can contact the San Francisco Entertainment Commission at: entertainment.commission@sfgov.org, 628-652-6030 with additional questions.

Working with Latino community leaders, City identifies new support for health, housing, food access, workforce and small businesses for community most impacted by virus
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced expanded COVID-related support for the Latino community, which has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. This new support comes after working with the community, particularly the Latino Parity and Equity Coalition, which has been advocating for more resources for the Latino community. This $28.5 million commitment will begin with an initial funding of $22.5 million to support the Latino community that will come through a variety of solutions, with focuses on health, housing, food access, workforce, and small businesses. The City will continue to leverage public and private sources to meet the remaining need. This effort was led by the Department of Public Health in partnership with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development.
""Our Latino community has borne the brunt of the COVID pandemic not just here in San Francisco, but across the country,"" said Mayor London N. Breed. ""While we have provided support for food access and financial assistance, it hasn't been enough. We can do more to support those who have been going to work day after day and who too often live in crowded conditions that make it hard to isolate. By working with the community, we have identified targeted areas of need that will help trusted leaders reach our most vulnerable where they are and provide the support to keep the community healthy.""
Latinos make up 50% percent of reported cases of COVID-19 in San Francisco, despite the demographic making up just 15% of the City's population, according to the Department of Public Health. The disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on the Latino community can be traced back to crowded living conditions and the high number of frontline and essential workers who are Latino.
""With more than 50% of San Francisco's COVID-19 cases in the Latino community, we need to continue to invest in services that can slow transmission of the virus and support people through their infection,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Public Health. ""In addition to testing and contact tracing, we are investing in wraparound care from isolation and quarantine to food assistance and healthcare. Working with community leaders and other City departments, we can mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in the Latino community and in San Francisco overall.""
""It's clear this pandemic continues to have traumatic impacts on our most vulnerable populations in San Francisco, especially for hard-working Latino families and workers who make up one in every two COVID-19 cases in San Francisco,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""The vital resources and investments Mayor Breed has prioritized to address the needs within this community reflect and respect the tireless and powerful advocacy and work of our partners, as well as our City's commitment to the most vulnerable and impacted. We are listening to community, and thankful for their leadership and partnership.""
These expanded efforts will cover a broad range of support directed to the community organizations doing the work on the ground, led by the Latino Parity and Equity Coalition and the Latino Task Force. The SFLPEC is a broad-based, citywide coalition which represents members from leading nonprofits, housing, immigration, social service, and advocate groups across the city that was established on the premise that the City's budget and policies should promote investments that empower Latino communities and reduce inequities for San Francisco's Latino residents, particularly in the wake of the unprecedented affordability and displacement crisis. The coalition focuses its work in five specific neighborhoods - Mission, Visitacion Valley, Bayview, Excelsior, and the Tenderloin.
""The San Francisco Latino Parity and Equity Coalition (SFLPEC) will work to achieve a timely, proactive and effective partnership with the City and County of San Francisco,"" said Mario Paz, on behalf of the Latino Parity and Equity Coalition. ""Together we must reverse the great tragedy befalling our community. Latinos represent 15 percent of our city's population, yet 51 percent of all those testing positive for the virus in our city. We commend Mayor Breed for her recognition of our community based response, and for acting quickly to secure $28.5 million for pandemic response for Latinos citywide. We are confident that by working together we can reverse the disproportionate impact of Covid 19 on the Latino community.""
""On behalf of the Latino Task Force, we appreciate all of the efforts of Mayor Breed in securing critical resources to address the needs of the Latinx community who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID. We are grateful for her ongoing commitment and leadership in keeping the needs of the Latinx community a priority in the City budget,"" said Valerie Tulier-Laiwa, Coordinator, Latino Task Force. ""These COVID response resources will be used directly to serve the thousands of people standing in the Mission Food Hub line and those seeking family relief and numerous other services at the Latino Task Force Resource Hub. It will also support a culturally appropriate and community-delivered approach at the LTF Testing Hub.""
The initial funding will come from a variety of sources both public and private, and will be spread across these areas of need:
Testing, Tracing & Behavioral Health
The Department of Public Health has secured $7.3 million to support COVID-19 response efforts in the Latino community. This includes $3 million for community pop-up testing hubs, which have been a key strategy to bring testing to neighborhoods most impacted by COVID-19. The additional investment includes test-to-community care services for Latino neighborhoods, connecting families in need to resources, including food, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and financial assistance programs. A fundamental component to reducing the spread of COVID-19 is community contract tracing. Funds for this effort will help increase the ability for Spanish speaking personnel to connect to the bilingual Latino population. In addition, this investment will provide added capacity in behavioral health services, such as mental wellness, for those affected by the virus.
Housing Subsidies & Eviction Defense
The Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) has secured $8.5 million in housing subsidies, direct financial assistance, and eviction prevention. This investment includes $5.5 million in rental subsidies and $2 million in funding for the City's Right to Recover program, which provides up to two weeks of minimum wage replacement, or $1,285, for any worker living in San Francisco who tests positive for the virus and anticipates experiencing financial hardship.
Furthermore, MOHCD is increasing its investment in eviction prevention services with an additional $1 million allocation that targets assistance to communities disproportionately affected by displacement, specifically residents in Districts 6, 9, 10 and 11. In addition to providing housing subsidies and investing in eviction prevention, MOHCD is assessing the flexibility of its future community development grants to support rapid COVID response initiatives and is also continuing to invest in the production and preservation of affordable housing with its community partners.
Food Access & Family Support
The City will be directing $5.3 million in additional funding for food access, learning support, and family support. Building off initial investments in food access for the Latino community, the Human Services Agency will provide an additional $3.6 million dollars to support vital nutrition resources for the Mission and neighborhoods with Latino residents most in need. These food supports will be provided through community food hubs offering fresh produce and healthy, culturally relevant grocery staples for pick up or delivery to vulnerable community members.
To support Spanish-speaking communities impacted by learning loss and social isolation, the Department of Children Youth and Families will expand San Francisco's innovative Community Hubs Initiative with $812,000 to stand up eight Community Hubs for children and youth.
First 5 San Francisco will be contributing the entirety of its recently approved COVID-19 Emergency Fund totaling $750,000 to meet the needs of Latino families with children 0 to 5 impacted by COVID-19. First 5 will also commit $150,000 in in-kind PPE, household supplies, and children's books.
Small Business & Workforce
The Office of Economic and Workforce Development is committing $1.4 million for workforce and small businesses. This includes $1 million in zero interest loans for small businesses who may have difficulty accessing more traditional loan products. The loans will provide capital with a flexible repayment schedule and the terms will be determined on a case-by-case basis, based upon each borrower's ability to repay. In addition to direct financial relief, expanded investments will provide additional technical assistance and resources for Latino-owned businesses to safely reopen. The Excelsior neighborhood will also receive funds to increase capacity for bilingual workforce development, including support for short-term case management and skills development, and wrap-around services connected to the City's COVID response.

City Controller report finds need for stricter and uniform standards regarding City departments' connections with philanthropic partner organizations
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today released an Executive Directive to strengthen transparency and accountability between City Departments and partner organizations by requiring uniform and stricter standards regarding fundraising.
The Executive Directive incorporates recommendations from the City Controller's most recent report in their review of City contracts and policies that Mayor Breed called for in the wake of the federal charges filed against the former head of the Department of Public Works. The most recent report focuses on the relationship between City Departments and non-City organizations, also known as ""Friends of organizations,"" which help raise money for City efforts and community priorities.
""These 'Friends of' organizations provide important philanthropic support for our parks, our libraries, and other important civic services, but we need to ensure that this support is not tainted with any perception or risk of 'pay to play' politics,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Many departments already follow strong protocols with these organizations, but the goal is for every department to meet the highest standard of transparency. We will continue to implement reforms and improve our existing policies to strengthen the public trust.""
The Executive Directive does four main things:
The Mayor's Executive Directive can be read here.
This is the second report released by the Controller after federal charges were filed against the Director of Public Works in January. When the indictment was first made public, Mayor Breed sent a letter to the City Attorney and Controller to investigate contracts and policies related to the charges, and that investigation began in February. Mayor Breed also directed all City staff to cooperate fully with any and all investigations.

The development will provide wraparound supportive services and stable housing for 256 adults exiting homelessness
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the groundbreaking of a new housing complex at 1064 Mission Street for adults and seniors who are exiting homelessness. The new site will be the largest Permanent Supportive Housing facility in San Francisco, adding 256 units to San Francisco's affordable housing portfolio, including 103 units specifically for seniors. Once completed in late 2021, 1064 Mission will also house the City's new Homeless Services Center, including the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team, the Street Medicine Team, and the relocated Department of Public Health Urgent Care Clinic.
""1064 Mission Street will provide stable housing and supportive services for hundreds of our most vulnerable residents. Permanent Supportive Housing is an integral part of our Homelessness Recovery Plan, and every new unit we add helps people exit our shelter system and makes more space available in shelter for people who are currently on the streets,"" said Mayor Breed. ""In addition to housing, this site will offer much-needed workforce development and will provide a centralized location for our City's homelessness services. Thanks to Episcopal Community Services and Mercy Housing for working with the City on this exciting project.""
This project is part of Mayor Breed's Homelessness Recovery Plan, which will expand capacity in the City's Homelessness Response System and make 6,000 placements available for people experiencing homelessness over the next two years.
The lot at 1064 Mission Street was formerly the parking lot for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2017, in collaboration with San Francisco's federal delegation, the City acquired the site from the federal government for $1 for the purposes of developing housing for people experiencing homelessness.
""For San Franciscans, solving homelessness is not an issue, it's a value,"" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""I was proud to play my part in helping secure this federal property for just $1. Today, we are one step closer to transforming this parking lot into permanent, supportive housing to ensure compassionate solutions to aid people experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity.""
1064 Mission Street is a collaborative partnership between the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD), the Department of Public Health (DPH), the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), Mercy Housing, and Episcopal Community Services (ECS). Mercy Housing is developing the property, which ECS will own, operate, and provide wraparound services to the site's future residents. Both Mercy Housing and Episcopal Community Services have a decades-long history of commitment to housing the most vulnerable San Franciscans.
""I'm thrilled that we are breaking ground on 1064 Mission Street,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney. ""This project will directly help people find housing and stability. Not only will this be the largest permanent supportive housing site in District 6, we will have on-site services to ensure that residents in the 256 units here are cared for and have access to life-saving resources. This work is more important than ever and I want to thank ECS and Mercy Housing for their leadership in making this happen.""
""If 2020 has taught us anything, it's how critical it is to have a home,"" said Doug Shoemaker, President, Mercy Housing California. ""We also know that if we want to end homelessness, we have to find new strategies like modular housing which dramatically reduces cost and saves time in construction. With Factory OS as a partner, we saved money while maintaining quality and paying workers a union wage.""
In addition to providing Permanent Supportive Housing to 256 formerly homeless San Franciscans, 1064 Mission Street will support a 6,000 square foot commercial kitchen space for ECS' signature social enterprise program: Conquering Homelessness through Employment in Food Services (CHEFS). CHEFS is a no cost, 12-week training program that combines classroom instruction, case management, in-kitchen hands-on training, employment auditions, and paid internships at local restaurants and institutional kitchens for people who have experienced homelessness.
""The new CHEFS Kitchen at 1064 Mission St. will allow an additional 300 people per year to participate in job training through the CHEFS program, developing skills that will enable them to alleviate poverty through careers in the food industry,"" said Beth Stokes, Executive Director of ECS. ""This facility will allow ECS to demonstrate its deep investment in workforce development programs that are instrumental in providing our clients with meaningful and rewarding employment to support their long-term stability and wellbeing.""
""The Homeless Services Center is the new clinical home of San Francisco's Whole Person Care program, a collaboration of multiple City departments that can link people experiencing homelessness to housing, benefits, and health care,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""DPH will provide primary care, urgent care, behavioral health, and dental services in the new Center. Our vision is to connect more people to more of the services they need, all under one roof, with wraparound care.""
""Housing is the solution to homelessness and is a critical component of our Homeless Response System of care, which moves thousands of people into stability every year,"" said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, Interim director of San Francisco's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. ""Throughout this public health crisis, it is imperative to protect the most vulnerable in our community with the Mayor's long-term Homeless Recovery Plan and to ensure that San Francisco is a livable city for everyone.""
""Under the leadership of Mayor Breed, and as part of the Homelessness Recovery Plan, breaking ground on 1064 Mission realizes our commitment to invest in and develop housing for our unhoused neighbors most in need,"" said Eric Shaw, MOHCD Director. ""We are thrilled to move forward with the largest permanent supportive housing site in San Francisco, and recognize that safe affordable housing with wraparound services are crucial in these turbulent times.""
ECS is currently engaged in a capital campaign to raise $2.5 million to build the new CHEFS Kitchen at 1064 Mission Street. Construction funding for 1064 Mission was secured through a $76 million loan from the Community Development Division of JP Morgan & Chase Co. Century Housing provided the developers with a $1.5 million loan, and $53 million in funding was provided by the National Equity Fund through tax credit syndication proceeds.
Major financing for 1064 Mission Street was provided by a $72.9 million investment from MOHCD, including $27.8 million in financing from the California Department of Housing and Community Development's No Place Like Home Program which the City applied for, and $13.5 million from DPH and HSH to support the operations for the new Homeless Services Center and Urgent Care Clinic.

September 23, 2020
Citywide effort is underway to count every resident in advance of September 30th deadline. Census Week of Action includes safe community outreach events, phone banking, and public service announcements from the San Francisco Giants and Golden State Warriors.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today launched San Francisco's Census Week of Action. The week of action is part of the City's SF Counts campaign, which aims to increase the self-response rate for Census 2020 by reaching out to hard-to-count communities, providing technical assistance, and educating the public that the Census is set to end on September 30th. City officials and departments, community organizations, faith leaders, and the business community are all mobilizing to help San Francisco obtain a complete census count.
""The Census is an important measurement of our community. In these tough economic times, we must protect critical federal resources for lifesaving programs and we must preserve our voice in the electoral process,"" said Mayor Breed. ""San Franciscans can help in a meaningful way by filling out the Census today and ensuring friends and family members do the same.""
San Francisco's current self-response rate for the 2020 Census is 65.6%, compared to 2010's final self-response rate of 68.5%. The statewide self-response rate for this year's census is currently 68.6%. Strategies to improve the count include in-person assistance in Civic Center, Chinatown, Bayview and the Mission District, phone banking by community-based organizations and City departments, door-to-door canvassing in undercounted communities, as well as additional outreach by trusted community leaders.
Since July 2019, San Francisco has been working with a network of over 30 City-funded community-based organizations, businesses, labor, the San Francisco Complete Count Committee, and hundreds of volunteers to conduct outreach to residents and encourage them to attend one of the in-person events if they need help filling out the census.
""San Francisco is united during our Citywide Census Week of Action to improve our count,"" said City Administrator Naomi M. Kelly. ""We thank the community groups, local sports teams and faith-based organizations that are helping us complete the count and ensure we get our fair share of federal funding.""
San Francisco Giants announcer Renel Brooks-Moon and Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr are assisting with public education by filming public service announcements to encourage participation. Their PSAs and a complete social media toolkit can be found here.

September 21, 2020
Funding from the State will allow the City to purchase the Granada Hotel for Permanent Supportive Housing, part of the next phase of Mayor Breed's Homelessness Recovery Plan
San Francisco, CA — Today San Francisco was awarded nearly $45 million in capital and operating costs from the State's Project Homekey for the purchase of the Granada Hotel as Permanent Supportive Housing. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing and Episcopal Community Services, with support from Supervisor Aaron Peskin, applied for $44.8 million in funding to purchase and refurbish the 232-room Lower Nob Hill hotel. The purchase of the hotel is part of Mayor Breed's Homelessness Recovery Plan, which includes the largest one-time expansion of Permanent Supportive Housing in 20 years.
""We know that housing is the solution to homelessness,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Throughout this public health crisis, we have provided emergency housing for thousands of unsheltered people but we have also developed a long-term Homelessness Recovery Plan to provide shelter and housing for thousands of people for years to come. Homekey funding will help our transition from response to recovery.""
Governor Newsom made the announcement today at his midday press conference for $236 million in Homekey funding for 20 projects statewide. Homekey, backed by $1.3 billion in newly available and eligible funding through the State budget, will allow for the largest expansion of housing for people experiencing homelessness in recent history, while addressing the continuing health and social service needs of this vulnerable population from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under the Homekey program, funding will be applied to the purchase and rehabilitation of The Granada Hotel, a 232-unit Single Room Occupancy building at 1000 Sutter Street with vacant units and existing tenants, including low-income senior residents, who are at-risk of potential displacement due to unrestricted rents. The Granada Project will both protect existing tenants at risk of homelessness and create new units of Permanent Supportive Housing for people experiencing chronic homelessness. Supervisor Aaron Peskin pushed for the Granada to be submitted as a Project Homekey applicant.
""My office has been working hard to create permanently affordable housing throughout District 3, and Lower Polk is one neighborhood we've spent a lot of time organizing in,"" said Supervisor Aaron Peskin. ""I proposed the Granada Hotel as a potential City acquisition site so we could preserve 232 units and keep existing tenants in their homes, and I hope the hard work of the past year to flesh out the details will pay off with this fortuitous Homekey Grant opportunity.""
In July, Mayor Breed announced her Homelessness Recovery Plan, with planned investments in the upcoming two-year budget and continued delivery of funded projects and programs, will expand the City's capacity in the Homelessness Response System. The Homelessness Recovery Plan will make 6,000 placements available for people experiencing homelessness through Coordinated Entry, including 4,500 placements in Permanent Supportive Housing. This includes acquiring or leasing 1,500 new units of Permanent Supportive Housing over the next two years, the largest one-time expansion in the City in 20 years.
""The Mayor and Governor believe that housing is not only the solution to homelessness, but is basic fundamental healthcare,"" said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, Interim Director of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. ""It is critical that we provide more housing, shelter, prevention and diversion for those experiencing homeless to realize our goal of not exiting anyone who came inside during this crisis to the street while preventing thousands more from becoming homeless during this pandemic.""
""Increasing our Permanent Supportive Housing portfolio is critical to our efforts to prevent and end homelessness,"" said Episcopal Community Services (ECS) Executive Director Beth Stokes. ""ECS is proud to partner with the City of San Francisco and State to purchase the Granada Hotel, which will allow us to provide stable housing opportunities for 232 San Franciscans.""
As of July 2020, San Francisco has approximately 8,000 units of Permanent Supportive Housing that provide permanent homes and services to approximately 10,000 San Franciscans.

Biden's campaign has selected a state director in Los Angeles and an organizing director in San Francisco, the campaign announced Monday.
Joining the campaign on the northern end of the Golden State is Lizzie Heyboer, who will serve as organizing director. Heyboer recently worked on Elizabeth Warren's campaign on the National Training Desk.
The democratic campaigner lives in San Francisco's Mission District.
Mark Gonzalaz, who has been the The Chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party since 2017, was hired to be Biden's California director. Gonzalaz has long been in service as a local leader within the Democratic Party, beginning in 2004 when he worked on the presidential campaign.
Gonzalaz currently serves as District Director to Assemblymember Miguel Santiago and was previously a Senior Field Representative to former Speaker John Pérez.
Gonzalaz also worked for the 2005 City of Los Angeles mayoral race, the 2006 gubernatorial race, and the 2008 presidential campaign for Former President Barack Obama.
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump's campaign hired Krista Pittman to act as California's state director, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Biden's campaign has spent $100 million on ""on-the-ground"" organizing so far, but the presidential nominee did not invest as heavily as other candidates during the primary.
While the campaign has mostly moved online amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Biden and Vice Presidential Nominee Sen. Kamala Harris are working on swaying those in ""battleground"" states.
Virtual events targeting California votes are however, on the horizon, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
Harris returned to the Golden State last week to meet with Gov. Gavin Newsom at Pine Ridge School in Auberry, California to view the damage wrought by the Creek Fire. It was her first visit since becoming Biden's running mate."

November 24, 2020
In place of large giveaway events that cannot occur due to COVID-19, City departments, the A. Phillip Randolph Institute, and community partners worked together to safely distribute turkeys at public housing locations and non-profit organizations
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the City, in partnership with the A. Philip Randolph Institute of San Francisco (APRI), delivered turkeys and other various dry goods to families at public housing sites and non-profit organizations in San Francisco as part of the 14th Annual Mayor's Turkey Giveaway. This Thanksgiving season the City and its partners created a new distribution plan because COVID-19 prevented the ability to do the annual turkey giveaways where large crowds gathered. Despite these challenges, more than 5,000 frozen turkeys and packages of dry goods were distributed across San Francisco to residents of public housing and families that have been severely financially impacted due to COVID-19.
This year's turkey giveaway is especially important for San Francisco's most vulnerable residents. Prior to COVID-19, one in four San Francisco residents were at risk of hunger due to low income. COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted these families even further. The City's unemployment rate is at an estimated 8.4%, with more than 200,000 San Franciscans applying for unemployment. While public schools, food banks, and state and local food security programs continue to provide food assistance for extremely low-income households, many families in public housing or underserved communities that have experienced a reduction in income and are struggling to make ends meet. The turkeys and packages of dry goods are providing some much-needed food security for the Thanksgiving holiday.
""This has been a hard year, and it's more important than ever before that we give back to our communities, especially those who are most in need,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Thanks to the generous contributions of our donors, we're able to continue this program during COVID-19 to help families enjoy Thanksgiving and the holiday season safely at home. If you're looking for a way to help your neighbors in need, you can volunteer or donate to support San Francisco community organizations that provide people food during the holidays and year-round.""
This year's turkey giveaway is a collaboration between the Mayor's Office, the San Francisco Human Services Agency, the San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA), the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, the San Francisco Police Department, the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD), and HOPE SF. The turkeys were provided by the City with the generous support of the A. Phillip Randolph Institute of San Francisco via contributions to the City's Give2SF Fund. Additionally, Whole Foods supported the giveaway with in-kind donation of 200 turkeys. Give2SF is currently accepting donations and funds provide shelter, food, and other assistance to individuals, families, small businesses, and nonprofits in San Francisco.
""The Mayor's turkey giveaway helps our communities most in need to share the abundance of joy and gratitude on Thanksgiving with a warm, nutritious meal. This annual tradition comes during a time when the need for hunger relief is greater than ever,"" said Trent Rhorer, Executive Director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency. ""The fight to end hunger in our communities will last beyond this holiday season. Anyone struggling to afford food is encouraged to call 311 to find assistance. San Francisco's pandemic emergency response services have provided millions of additional meals to help families through this incredibly challenging time. Please join us in giving back where you can to support our neighbors facing hardships from COVID-19.""
Due to COVID-19, the turkey deliveries were offered as part of existing food distribution efforts and there will not be giveaway events as in past years. Instead, SFHA and MOHCD helped distribute the turkeys. SFHA and MOCHD have been coordinating food to approximately 3,200 families living at their housing sites since the Stay Home Order took effect in March 2020. Staff members been follow all COVID-19 safety protocols, and cleanliness and sanitation requirements.
""Food security is an important facet of all our lives, which cannot be ignored regardless of the season,"" said Tonia Lediju, Acting Executive Director and Transition Lead, San Francisco Housing Authority. ""The opportunity to care for others by showing our concern through meeting a fundamental need anytime is both an honor for SFHA and a necessity to uplift the individuals and families served in our great City. Being a partner in this effort is personally gratifying. It is an extension of who I am and who I was raised to be.""
The A. Phillip Randolph Institute (APRI), a local nonprofit organization, identifies families in need and helps to distribute the turkeys. The deliveries took place between Wednesday, November 18 and Monday, November 23, and the turkeys were handed out to families at public housing sites in San Francisco in time for Thanksgiving.
""The holidays are a time to reflect on what we are thankful for and a perfect time to share compassion with our neighbors,"" said Jackie Flin, Executive Director of APRI. ""We want our community to know that we care about them, not just by our words, but also through our actions. It is an incredible privilege to serve the residents of San Francisco, and we look forward to continuing to making a difference in our community.""
""Whole Foods Market is proud to continue our commitment to helping the community become more food secure through our partnership with the city and the Mayor's Turkey Giveaway,"" said Omar Gaye, Whole Foods Market President of the Northern California Region. ""It is both inspiring and a privilege to be involved in this annual tradition that brings the city and partner organizations together in such an impactful way to support families in need through access to nourishing food during the holiday season.""
Last week, Mayor Breed launched the We Will Recover campaign to promote individual actions San Franciscans can take to support San Francisco's recovery from COVID-19. We Will Recover focuses on three ways people can do their part this holiday season: Holidays at Home, Shop and Dine in the 49, and Help Your Neighbors in Need.
Help your Neighbors in Need features San Francisco-based volunteering opportunities focused on food security and anti-isolation efforts during the holidays and into the new year. The site lists a range of volunteer opportunities with non-profit organizations that are working to provide food access and anti-isolation support to San Francisco residents. Help Your Neighbors in Need offers both in-person and virtual volunteer options. For those who prefer to donate to philanthropic efforts, the site offers San Francisco based giving campaigns that support San Francisco non-profit organizations, including the City's Give2SF Fund.

San Franciscans who are need assistance getting or affording food should call 311 or visit sf.gov/get-food-resources.

November 24, 2020
Ellis, a progressive advocate and former Executive Director of the largest female political candidate training program in the country, will lead the Department's work of advocating for women, girls, and non-conforming people
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced that Kimberly Ellis will serve as the Director of the Department on the Status of Women. Ellis, a longtime progressive activist, formerly served as the Executive Director of Emerge California, the largest training program in the country for aspiring female political candidates. She is a progressive activist who has fought for the rights and representation of historically underrepresented groups on the local, state, and national level.
""I'm proud to announce that Kimberly Ellis will serve as the next Director of the Department on the Status of Women,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Kimberly is a tireless advocate for those who are too often overlooked in our society, and I know that in this role she will continue that work by improving the lives of women and girls in San Francisco. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately impacting women, exacerbating disparities that already existed beforehand. That's why the work of the Department on the Status of Women remains more important than ever and why I'm proud that Kimberly will be leading it for years to come.""
The Department on the Status of Women was established in 1994 when voters approved Proposition E, which created a permanent Department to carry out the mission and polices of the Commission on the Status of Women. The Commission on the Status of Women was established in 1975 to ensure the equitable treatment and foster the advancement of the women and girls in San Francisco through programs, policies and legislation. In 1998, San Francisco became the first city in the world to adopt a local ordinance reflecting the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), an international bill of rights for women and girls.
""Equity and its creation of economic independence are the silver bullets for so many troubles facing all those this department intends to serve, and I am equally humbled and determined to make lasting change in the lives of all San Franciscans,"" said Kimberly Ellis. ""We know that when we raise up women, girls, trans, and gender non-conforming people, every aspect of our society improves. I thank Mayor Breed and the Commission for entrusting me to help transform and renew this vital department. A new era has begun in America and it's time we empower all marginalized people in the dismantling of systemic racism and the white male patriarchy that has held too many back for far too long.""
After running national operations for Emerge America, Ellis was tapped to lead the flagship affiliate, Emerge California, as its Executive Director. For nearly a decade, Ellis successfully led the California affiliate, growing what had been a regional training program into a statewide electoral force for women candidates and elected officials.
Inspired by her grandmother's lifetime of community service, Ellis launched Unbought - Unbossed (UnB2) in summer 2018. An incubator for the next generation of political disruptors, at its core, UnB2 is about civic education, civic engagement and civic empowerment. Unbought - Unbossed was designed to be a powerful vehicle to drive a collective narrative to elevate and support the voices and work of everyday activists who seek to create progressive change in their communities.
""Kimberly Ellis is an outstanding choice to lead the Department into its next chapter,"" said Breanna Zwart, President of the Commission on the Status of Women. ""Ms. Ellis will bring a wealth of unique experience as a grassroots activist and leader to the role, including extensive civic engagement across California and serving as the executive director of the nation's largest training program for female candidates for office. I look forward to working with her in ensuring justice and equal opportunity for all women, girls, and gender-nonconforming people across our city and the region.""
""Kimberly Ellis is a vibrant leader who possesses the experience and skill to bring together a broad coalition for the common good,"" said philanthropist Susie Tompkins Buell. ""Her appointment to lead the Department on the Status of Women will elevate it to a new level and her leadership will be a boon to other women's groups and to the City and County of San Francisco as a whole.""
""Many people are effective leaders, but it's Kimberly's heart and her undeniable record as an ardent flag bearer for women and historically marginalized communities that ensures her tenure will truly be transformative for women, girls, trans people, and our gender non-confirming community here in San Francisco and beyond,"" said Mia Satya, former Youth Commissioner. ""Kimberly will certainly take this critical department to a whole new level at a time when we need her unique skills the most. We could have no greater champion and fearless warrior than her and I can't wait to see what she'll do!""

As counting of ballots in the presidential election dragged on this month, many followers of U.S. politics have revisited a question that has often been asked since the 2000 and 2016 elections: Why has our Electoral College system once again left the choices of a few hundred thousand voters in a half-dozen states in charge of determining a president for 328 million Americans?
As of this writing, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and running mate Senator Kamala D. Harris have racked up over 5.6 million more votes across the country than the Trump-Pence ticket and are on track to a 306-232 win in the Electoral College. But had just a few tens of thousands of votes swung the other way in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, the result could have been a narrow re-election for the president and the third time since 2000 that the loser of the popular vote count nevertheless got elected president.
What is the Electoral College?
The Electoral College refers to the group of ""electors"" designated by the Constitution to be chosen by state governments to elect the president and vice president of the United States. The concept came to fruition during the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787, during which a couple of committees were established to decide how to elect the president of the newly formed United States of America.
During the course of the convention, the country's founders considered three approaches: selection of a president by the Congress, selection of a president by the legislatures of the states, and a ""popular"" election, which at that time would have been restricted to only white, land-owning male citizens. James Wilson, a delegate from Pennsylvania, called the challenge of getting 13 states' delegates to agree on how to choose the president ""in truth, one of the most difficult of all we have to decide.""
The committee that ultimately put together the final proposal was called the committee for ""Unfinished Portions"", which responded to support for a separation of powers by creating the electoral college system rather than have the national legislature elect the president (source). Because they were heavily outnumbered population-wise, southern states objected to any form of direct popular vote. After compromises creating a House of Representatives apportioned by population and a Senate with two senators from each state, the founders agreed to a hybrid plan for electing the president: each state would get a number of ""electoral votes"" equal to the sum of its representatives in Congress plus two Senators, with three-fifths of the number of enslaved persons counted for the purposes of House representation. The candidate winning the most electoral votes would become president. With an Electoral College of 538 electors today, candidates must win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president and vice president.
What are the arguments for and against the existence of the Electoral College?
Arguments for retaining and abolishing the Electoral College have waxed and waned ever since the Constitution was ratified. After just 16 years, in fact, Congress enacted the 12th Amendment,
changing the original Electoral College process to clarify that electoral votes would be cast separately for president and vice president rather than the initial system under which the candidate placing second became vice president, leading to political opponents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams serving atop the same administration and other political challenges.
While far from exhaustive, this list tries to capture some of the principal arguments for and against the Electoral College:
For: The most commonly proposed alternative to the Electoral College, a national popular vote, could result in an administrative nightmare if the popular vote were as close nationally as it was this year in individual states like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. A direct nationwide popular vote could also create an incentive to maximize the votes and turnout in the most partisan states, including potentially through fraud in states where one party controls the governor's office, chief elections office, and the legislature with no effective oversight. Diffusing responsibility for the presidential election among 50 states and D.C. acts as a check against election fraud."

November 23, 2020
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development, the San Francisco Arts Commission, and Community Vision today announced $3.1 million in financial assistance for nonprofit organizations. The grant funding will help neighborhood-serving nonprofit organizations acquire space, relocate or renovate their facilities, and secure long-term leases or ownership, and advances Mayor Breed's ongoing efforts to promote San Francisco's economic recovery.
The Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative is aligned with several key recommendations from the Economic Recovery Task Force. The grants stabilize and preserve operations for nonprofit organizations that ensure access to affordable housing, advance job connections, meet the basic needs of the City's most vulnerable residents, and promote accessible arts and culture programming. Additionally, the Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative provides a model of advisory services for commercial tenants that the Economic Recovery Task Force recommended the city expand to avoid foreclosures and evictions.
""During this pandemic, our Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative investments have shown the power and potential of owning your own space,"" said Mayor Breed. ""We've seen the Mission Resource Hub spring into action for food security and family resources, we've seen La Casa de las Madres and the Asian Women's Shelter address a heartbreaking rise in domestic violence, we've seen Meals on Wheels grow meal production and jobs in the Bayview. These nonprofits are all prior recipients of NSI funding, and they've been crucial to the City's pandemic response by providing key services and resources to thousands of residents. San Francisco's nonprofit community will play an important part in our economic recovery, ensuring that we keep up our focus on equity, and continue our investments in neighborhood organizations and our most vulnerable residents.""
Nonprofit organizations are invited to apply for this funding, which is part of the San Francisco Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative, a multi-agency collaboration to address key challenges facing the nonprofit sector, including the high costs of real estate. San Francisco's groundbreaking approach to create and sustain the Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative has been adapted regionally and across the country.
""Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative grants have strengthened Black, Latinx, immigrant and women led organizations so they may continue their service to our diverse communities. Our City's neighborhood and community-serving nonprofit partners have been vital in addressing essential needs as well as longstanding inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""We continue to hear from nonprofit leaders that real estate investments are critical to their resilience —allowing them to predict costs, work together, build equity, and deliver essential services to our most vulnerable residents while promoting San Francisco's economic recovery.""
The Mission Resource Hub, owned collectively by Jamestown Community Center, Mission Neighborhood Centers, Inc., and the Mission Economic Development Agency (MEDA) and operated in collaboration with the Latino Task Force and Mission Language and Vocational School, was a recipient of the Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative. The organization received a $1 million grant to acquire their new space. Today, the Hub serves as the primary resource center for wraparound services.
""The Mission Resource Hub has been a lifeline for Jamestown Community Center's youth and their families in the Mission and Excelsior,"" said Nelly Sapinski, Executive Director of Jamestown. ""With the Mission Resource Hub in place, our families are receiving basic needs support such as food and financial assistance as well as connection to essential services such as COVID testing and healthcare during this challenging time and unprecedented crisis.""   
Over the past three and a half years, San Francisco's Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative has supported the ownership and stabilization of nonprofit space for 59 organizations for an average lease term of 7.1 years. San Francisco organizations have been awarded a total of $12.37 million. Twelve nonprofits have secured permanent homes including organizations supporting youth, seniors, immigrants, survivors of domestic violence, artists, and people with disabilities.  In August, Mayor Breed announced $3.1 million in grants, including $2.15 million in vital support for Latino-led organizations expanding their space and services at new affordable housing sites in the Mission District.
The nearly 6,600 nonprofit organizations that call San Francisco home are an important part of the City's unique fabric and economic recovery. Many of San Francisco's nonprofits deliver critical services to support the most vulnerable in our communities, advance racial equity, and enrich and expand appreciation for the arts and culture during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately one of every 14 employees in San Francisco works at a nonprofit, accounting for approximately 49,000 jobs. This includes 37% of all healthcare and social assistance workers, 64% of educational service providers and 21% of those employed in the arts, entertainment, and recreation.
Nonprofits that are eligible for the Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative grants may apply for support in the following four categories:
Nonprofits interested in applying for assistance can visit communityvisionca.org/sfsustainability for program details, eligibility guidelines, and to register for information sessions. Information sessions will take place on Thursday, December 3 at 5:00pm and on Wednesday, January 6 at 10:00am. Applications must be received by 12:00 pm, January 29, 2021 to be considered for awards.
""Even in these unprecedented times, security of place continues to be a priority for nonprofits,"" said Saul Ettlin, Director of Consulting at Community Vision. ""These critical funds help organizations stay in the communities they serve and deliver on their missions.""
The Nonprofit Sustainability Initiative complements San Francisco's funding of nonprofit services and resources for low-income residents and aims to maintain and expand these vital services by deploying financial assistance, professional services, assessment tools and other resources to address key challenges facing the sector, including the high costs of real estate. In 2019-20, the City's financial investment in nonprofit services and resources in San Francisco totaled more than $995 million supporting access to health care, housing, legal assistance, counseling, job training, arts education, child care and other vital services and resources.

Visitors to gardens enrolled in government food assistance programs can visit the Botanical Garden, Conservatory of Flowers, and Japanese Tea Garden year-round at no cost
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the San Francisco Botanical Garden, Conservatory of Flowers, and the Japanese Tea Garden will offer year-round, free admission to any visitors receiving government food assistance benefits. Free admission of up to four people will be granted at all three Golden Gate Park gardens with an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card showing enrollment in CalFresh or other Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). San Francisco residents who show their Medi-Cal card can also receive free admissions to the gardens of Golden Gate Park.
The free access to the gardens of Golden Gate Park advances a key priority of the City's Economic Recovery Task Force by serving San Francisco's most vulnerable residents and ensuring all San Franciscans can access and enjoy the City's unique cultural assets.
""Access to nature is more important than ever and Golden Gate Park in particular has been an oasis for so many of us during COVID-19,"" said Mayor Breed. ""All San Franciscans, regardless of their income, should have access to the art and cultural institutions that our city has to offer. Now income won't be a barrier in preventing visitors to the Park from taking in our beautiful Botanical Garden, visiting the Conservatory of Flowers, and exploring history at the oldest public Japanese garden in the country.""
Admission fees at the gardens range from $20 to $38 for a family of four to visit, creating a barrier for low-income families to access the cultural and educational benefits that these institutions offer. While access to the San Francisco Botanical Garden is free for San Francisco residents, approximately 35% of the Garden's visitors live outside of San Francisco.
""We all deserve access to nature, wonder, and discovery. These experiences enrich our interests, deepen our learning, and ease our stress. Our commitment to equity means income is no longer a barrier to enter Golden Gate Park's world class gardens,"" said San Francisco Recreation and Park Department General Manager Phil Ginsburg.
The benefits are a result of the three San Francisco Recreation and Park Department institutions joining Museums for All, a national access program of the Institute of Museum and Library Services and administered by the Association of Children's Museums. Museums for All aims to break down that barrier to open doors of opportunity for families to experience cultural education programming, and is part of the gardens' broad commitment to seek, include, and welcome all audiences. In addition, through San Francisco Museums for All, San Francisco residents can show their Medi-Cal card or EBT to receive free admission to the gardens of Golden Gate Park and other museums and cultural attractions throughout the City.
More than 500 institutions participate in the national Museums for All initiative, including the California Academy of Sciences, Children's Creativity Museum, de Young Museum, Exploratorium, GLBT Historical Society Museum, and Museum of Craft and Design in San Francisco. In San Francisco, over twenty museums and cultural institutions participate in San Francisco Museums for All, which provides free admissions to benefits recipients of the San Francisco Human Services Agency.
Eligibility Guidelines for Free Admission to the Gardens of Golden Gate Park:
San Francisco residents: People who receive CalFresh or Medi-Cal can receive up to four free tickets when they show their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card or Medi-Cal card and proof of San Francisco residency.
Non San Francisco residents: People who receive CalFresh or SNAP benefits can receive up to four free tickets when they show their Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card.

Proposition H, placed on the ballot by Mayor Breed and passed with over 60% of the vote, streamlines the permitting process for small businesses and helps them respond to new conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today issued an Executive Order to City departments to implement Proposition H, the Save our Small Businesses ballot measure, within 30 days. A working group of relevant departments will be convened by the Mayor's Office to implement the process reforms set out in Proposition H in order to make it easier for small businesses to open, as well as adjust their operations, as small businesses continue to struggle during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Proposition H, which was sponsored by Mayor Breed and approved by voters in the November 2020 election, streamlines the permitting process for businesses, creates more flexibility in zoning and how businesses can operate, supports arts nonprofits, and encourages more vibrant commercial corridors throughout the City. It requires the City to shorten the permitting process for permitted uses to 30 days, which will save many small businesses months in process and often tens of thousands of dollars in associated costs. Proposition H additionally relaxes some zoning restrictions and allows more businesses to provide a mix of products and services, as well as allowing art-nonprofits to use some commercial corridors where they were previously unable to do so.
""Our system for permitting small businesses to open and operate was broken before the pandemic, but now it's a matter of life and death for countless restaurants, retail establishments, and other businesses that we know and love in our community,"" said Mayor Breed. ""That's why I introduced Prop H, and why an overwhelming majority of voters supported it, because we don't have time to waste. With this Executive Order, we're moving quickly to implement these changes now and help our small business community not only survive, but also recover and help get our economy back on track.""
San Francisco is home to approximately 94,000 small businesses, which make up 94 percent of all businesses in the City. This vital sector of our economy generates almost 360,000 jobs, employing about half of San Francisco's workforce and contributing to the vibrancy of the City's diverse neighborhoods.
Under the current system, small businesses must receive numerous permits from multiple City departments before they can operate. This process can regularly take between 6 months and a year and half, during which businesses are paying rent, taxes, and other operating expenses without being able to serve a single customer. These exorbitant upfront costs and unreasonable time delays deter people from starting business, leading to more vacant store fronts, less vibrant merchant corridors, fewer employment opportunities, and a smaller tax base. Small businesses that are already operating experience these permitting challenges as well. When attempting to acquire a new permit or change the way in which they operate, existing businesses must also go through an arcane permitting process that can take months.
""Proposition H is the most meaningful legislation to impact San Francisco small businesses in many years. Business permits can take over a year to obtain. Prop H reduces this to 30 days or less. Prop H gives existing businesses new tools to survive, and dramatically reduces the hassles new businesses face when trying to get started,"" said Sharky Laguana, President of the San Francisco Small Business Commission. ""San Francisco voted strongly in favor of Prop H, and we are very excited to see it implemented in the small business community.""
""Our small business community was suffering before the complete devastation of the COVID-19 crisis, so the implementation of Prop H could not come at a better time to help us rebuild our beloved neighborhood corridors,"" said Ben Bleiman, President of the San Francisco Entertainment Commission. ""It is hard to overstate the positive effects that Prop H will have on both existing and new small businesses. Rather than take years to open - while paying rent the entire time - new mom and pop stores will be able to open their doors in only 30 days. For businesses trying to adapt their models to the changing economy, what used to take hundreds of days and mountains of red tape now can be done with a simple authorization. The road ahead is going to still be incredibly difficult for the small business community, but Prop H gives us a fighting chance. We thank Mayor Breed on her bold, visionary leadership to help Prop H become a reality!""
""Prop H is critical to the success of our small businesses, and I'm glad Mayor Breed is moving so quickly to get it implemented,"" said Cyn Wang, Wang Insurance Agency. ""We don't have time to waste because countless small businesses in San Francisco are struggling every day to get by, and I'm optimistic that this will make a difference for our city's economic recovery.""
""After taking 3+ years to open Che Fico on the second floor of an old auto body garage we were struck by the complete inadequacy of the process,"" said David Nayfeld, Chef and Partner, Che Fico and Che Fico Alimentari. ""We were in a position to improve the building, the community, and add to the city's tax base, yet we slowed at every turn of the process. There was never any guidance or visibility on how long it would take. There were so many times people told us to give up and walk away. We are very fortunate that we stayed the course. Because we could. So many would-be small business owners don't have the resources to fight against a machine like that. Prop H will finally create accountability and more importantly, visibility around this already daunting task of opening a business in San Francisco.""
Mayor Breed's other recently announced efforts to support small business and arts and cultural organizations include:
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Breed has launched several initiatives and programs to assist businesses in San Francisco:

The San Francisco Creative Corps pilot program will provide economic opportunities for 60 visual and performance artists, while also promoting public health during global COVID-19 pandemic
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the launch of the San Francisco Creative Corps pilot program to support artists and promote public health through art. The San Francisco Creative Corps pilot will provide economic opportunities for 60 San Francisco performance artists and visual artists who are underemployed due to COVID-19. The program is part of Mayor Breed's ongoing focus on economic recovery and slowing the spread of COVID-19 in San Francisco.
This holiday season, performing artists, including actors, musicians, and dancers, will be deployed as Community Health Ambassadors to creatively promote COVID-safe behavior. The Community Health Ambassadors will be deployed to areas have the greatest need for COVID-19 outreach, including Shared Spaces corridors, streets with outdoor restaurants, parks, and other high foot traffic areas. The City will also engage 30 visual artists to beautify storefronts with public health-themed murals in neighborhoods experiencing high rates of COVID-19. The first round of San Francisco Creative Corps' Community Health Ambassadors will start this Saturday, November 21. The program will bring on 30 ambassadors who will be activated throughout the city on weekends during the upcoming holidays.
""Many artists and performers are out of work due to COVID and are looking for ways to pay their bills and make a living while also pursuing their artistic interests,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This new program supports artists financially while also reminding community members to stay safe this holiday season. San Francisco's artists and cultural organizations are what make our city such a vibrant place, and we need to do all we can to support them. The Creative Corps is an innovate approach to help our artists during this difficult time, and will bring some joy and fun to public spaces throughout the City.""
The San Francisco Creative Corps program advances Mayor Breed's efforts to support artists, arts, and culture organizations as part of San Francisco's economic recovery. In recognition of the severe and ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19 on the arts and entertainment sector, as well as the importance of the arts to San Francisco's identity, the Economic Recovery Task Force recommended that the City invest in supporting artists through programs like this one. In addition to supporting the arts, the Task Force recommended pursuing job connections, promoting safe reopening, and advancing racial equity, which this program fulfills with its focus on public health and investing in San Francisco's diverse communities.
""San Francisco's artistic communities are integral to our recovery efforts and the ongoing cultural and economic vitality of the city. By empowering artists, musicians, performers and muralists through Creative Corps, we're cultivating an ecosystem where San Francisco artists can expand their contributions to the communities they live in and care for,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""Innovative programs such as Creative Corps will promote public health and safety messaging, support local businesses, and create jobs, while bringing inspiration and holiday cheer into our shared and public spaces.""
The City is funding the SF Creative Corps with $250,000 from the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), and is working with Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA) and Paint the Void to administer the program. YBCA will administer the Community Health Ambassadors component of the Creative Corps program. YBCA will select artists in partnership with three local performing arts organizations: San Francisco Bay Area Theater Company, Dance Mission, and SF Carnaval. The San Francisco Parks Alliance, in partnership with OEWD and the City's COVID-19 Command Center, will assist with assigning Ambassadors to specific locations.
""The arts are a powerful tool for providing education and emotional healing, with a unique capacity to creatively communicate the need for public safety, while also delivering much-needed joy and inspiration,"" said Deborah Cullinan, CEO, YBCA. ""The SF Creative Corps connects San Francisco's diverse and extensive creative community with the urgent civic needs that have been heightened by COVID-19, the resulting economic recession, and ongoing racial injustice. The pilot supports the city's artists during this challenging time by offering them work and the chance to activate public spaces in service of our collective well-being. Thanks to our arts partners and the City and County of San Francisco, the SF Creative Corps will educate and inspire people to care for themselves and each other.""
In collaboration with the City and its three partner organizations, YBCA will train the Community Health Ambassadors on COVID-19 safety protocols and communications. YBCA will provide a workshop to support the ambassadors in developing their own unique projects, which can take any form they wish, from live music to drive-by-dance-a-thons to comedian sets.
In addition to funding Community Health Ambassadors, the SF Creative Corps program will support the development of murals that promote public health. The City is working with Paint the Void, a Bay Area initiative to match local artists with boarded up businesses to create murals as a response to the ""void"" left behind by COVID-19. Paint the Void will solicit local visual artists and match them with boarded up businesses to create temporary murals that encourage public health and safety conscious practices in neighborhoods affected most heavily by COVID-19. Artists that live in or have strong ties with the neighborhood selected for an installation will be prioritized. Murals will highlight behaviors that protect the community: wearing masks, avoiding gathering in large numbers, and staying indoors. Illuminate SF, an organization dedicated to expanding the City's light art, will provide temporary lighting on many of the murals.
""The SF Creative Corps is an opportunity not only to bring beauty and joy to public spaces but also to support artists during an economically challenging time while educating communities with critical public health messaging,"" says Inga Bard, co-founder of Paint the Void and Art for Civil Discourse. ""Art has the power to ignite public imagination towards a deeper understanding of how the virus spreads and how our actions can protect our families, friends, and neighbors.""
San Francisco visual artists are invited to submit their work to Paint the Void in order to be considered for this pilot by filling out this short form. For more information on the San Francisco Creative Corps Community Health Ambassadors, please contact aescobedo@ybca.org.
San Francisco Creative Corps complements San Francisco's other efforts to support artists, including a new universal basic income pilot program for San Francisco artists, which will start early next year. The Arts Commission will also provide arts organizations with funding to reopen safely and will fund the creation of an online Arts Hub, which will serve as a one-stop-shop for artists and organizations looking for financial assistance, professional networking, and employment opportunities. Additionally, the Arts Commission has opened four other grant programs for artists, arts organizations, and cultural facilities. In August, Mayor Breed announced approximately $12.8 million in general operating support grants to fund 227 arts and cultural organizations that enhance the City's cultural vibrancy. In March, Mayor Breed directed $2.5 million for an Arts Relief Program to invest directly in working artists and arts and cultural organizations financially impacted by COVID-19.

Good Morning, Mission! Welcome to Virus Village, your daily Covid-19 data dump.
NOTE: You may experience technical problems on mobile for which we apologize and are working to fix. Scroll slowly. Softly.
City officials responded to the quickly spreading virus and surging case numbers by once again slowing down social connectivity. As we've learned over the past 8 months, the City really has no other options to control the virus. If this doesn't work, some form of shelter-in-place orders may be coming soon. Meanwhile, expect more advise/guidance on limiting travel, limiting the number of people at a gathering and wearing masks.
The other move the City made was to announce the eviction of unhoused residents from hotels, a move which defied logic and provoked protest from those who have been volunteering to keep the unhoused safe and sheltered. What happened to the hundreds of millions from Prop C?
Scroll down for today's COVID numbers.
For mobile users if you experience difficulties, here are today's key data points:
&#65279;
As of November 14, the Mission has had a total of 1925 cases or a rate of 32.3 cases per 1000 residents. In comparison, Bayview Hunters Point has 45, Tenderloin 36.5,Visitacion Valley 29.6, Excelsior 27.4, Marina 10.5, Pacific Heights 10.1, Twin Peaks, 8.5, Haight Ashbury 5.3, and Sunset/Parkside 5.1 cases per 1000 residents. Seacliff still has less than ten cases total.

Not much change in the R number indicates we're in the thick of it.

For the week ending November 9, the seven-day average number of daily cases rose to 95 or 10.9 cases per 100,000 residents, well within the DPH ""high alert"" zone.

&#65279;&#65279;
The Citywide seven-day average percentage of tests resulting positive rose again to 1.95 percent. Yesterday, Dr. Colfax'comments suggested the positivity rate may be artificially low due to an influx of residents getting tested before travelling for Thanksgiving.

For the week ending Sunday November 15, the change in Covid positive patients rose 1 percent. Remember hospitalizations generally lag about two weeks after cases begin to surge. The DPH goal is to keep 20 percent of ICU beds and 15 percent of Acute Care beds free. On November 15, 41 percent of ICU beds and 29 percent of Acute Care beds were available.

Two percent of the cases so far are among unhoused residents or those ""experiencing homelessness"".

The City reached 156 deaths on November 9. What the current number is we can't say. But with the current volatile transmission and surging case numbers, expect more deaths over the next few months.

Clara-Sophia Daly Nov 16, 2020
It was a lively morning at 22nd and Mission streets, where some 50 activists and community members gathered to share tamales and protest the upcoming eviction of 2,400 unhoused San Francisco residents who have been living in hotels during the shelter-in-place order.
Silvia Viviana stood tall on a stage and listed off a litany of demands, including an ""immediate end to street sweeps, the creation of long-term pathways to permanent housing, and an end to subsidies for capitalist real estate moguls.""
Viviana is a Mission resident who volunteers for Hotels Not Hospitals, a community organization that organized the protest and has been working against displacement since the pandemic began. Viviana says that San Francisco should use eminent domain, the right of a government to use private property for public use, to appropriate empty unused buildings for unhoused San Franciscans.
""We want to take action and demand an end to all evictions,"" Viviana said.
C.H. Zazueta, a 23-year-old Mission resident, echoed Viviana's demands, and added that ""we must build networks of mutual aid to provide resources to unhoused neighbors.""
The speakers cheered and onlookers waved signs calling for ""Housing for People, Not Profits.""

Many questioned the city's logic in displacing people from shelter-in-place hotels when coronavirus infections are increasing rapidly.
At present, the city plans to move the first wave of homeless residents out of hotels and into Navigation Centers on Dec. 21. Activists said these centers are already overcrowded. The city has also proposed to provide bus tickets out of San Francisco and housing vouchers to unhoused people.
Hotels Not Hospitals formed in March in response to the pandemic crisis, and since then it has been raising money to ""rent hotel rooms for unsheltered folks using community-donated funds.""
So far, they have raised enough to house seven people in hotels, according to Evan Owski, a 33-year-old fundraiser and social media manager for the group At present, the city has 2,306 unhoused residents in hotel rooms. They plan to keep the seven in the hotel rooms indefinitely. The group organized another protest this morning in the Financial District which happened concurrently.

The We Will Recover campaign encourages San Franciscans to take action to support the recovery of San Francisco and offers information and resources for residents to celebrate the holidays safely, support local businesses, and find ways to volunteer and support charity for those in need
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the launch of the We Will Recover campaign to promote individual actions that San Franciscans can take to support the City's recovery from COVID-19. We Will Recover launches amidst an increase in COVID-19 cases in an effort to offer the public ways to engage in traditional holiday activities safely during the pandemic.
We Will Recover focuses on three ways people can do their part this holiday season: Holidays at Home, Shop and Dine in the 49, and Help Your Neighbors in Need.
For more information about We Will Recover, go to sf.gov/wewillrecover
""San Francisco will recover from COVID-19, but what that recovery looks like and how fast it comes is on all of us. Our individual actions to control the spread of the virus, to support our small businesses, and to help our neighbors in need is the key to our City emerging from the pandemic together,"" said Mayor Breed. ""The choices we make in how we spend our time and our money will lay the groundwork for our recovery from COVID and the economic challenges that have come with it. As we go into a holiday season unlike any other we've experienced, we wanted to show people all of the ways that they could support the City, even during a global pandemic.""
All three focuses of the We Will Recover campaign are central to positioning San Francisco for economic recovery. Continuing to manage and minimize the spread of the virus is key to continuing the City's trajectory towards reopening and increasing economic activity. Supporting small local businesses allows those unique San Francisco establishments that are central to the City's character continue to survive as they have during the challenges of the last nine months. San Francisco's economic recovery also depends on meeting the needs of the most vulnerable residents. Philanthropic and volunteer efforts on the part of the public are important complements to the City's ongoing efforts to fund programs and services that ensure San Franciscans have access to food, shelter, mental health, and other services.
""This is not an ordinary year and this will not be an ordinary holiday. It will be difficult but our actions this holiday season protect our loved ones and our community in the long run. Our ability to mitigate this virus is the best gift we can give to our family, friends, neighbors and our local businesses,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax. ""Choose to give the gift of health this holiday season by taking precautions and limiting activities to ensure we can celebrate big next year.""
Small businesses make up more than nine out of ten San Francisco businesses, employing more than half of the City's workforce and generating tens of billions in economic activity each year – most of which remains in the City. Up to half of San Francisco's small businesses are at risk of permanently closing. If San Francisco is to emerge from the pandemic with the robust small, local business base that it is so famous for and that makes the city such a diverse and vibrant place, San Franciscans must continue to support their neighborhood shops.
""This holiday season is crucial this year for our small businesses and they need our support. As many small businesses continue to struggle through this pandemic, every dollar counts to help them make ends meet and keep thousands of San Franciscans employed,"" said Joaquín Torres, Director of the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. ""As we make safe and smart choices to shop and dine, we want residents to remember that San Francisco's mecca of amazing restaurants and local producers of crafts and products can survive only through your support and spending. Every dollar spent at local businesses, especially at our mom and pop shops in the diverse neighborhoods that define our City's character, is essential for the ongoing cultural and economic vitality of San Francisco.""
""Shop and Dine in the 49 has become an important part campaign for San Francisco's small businesses,"" said Maryo Mogannam, President, Council of District Merchants. ""It is woven into the fabric of our small business community, and now more than ever it is critical to the survival of our small businesses.""
Likewise, volunteering and donating to local San Francisco non-profit organizations supports vulnerable San Francisco residents who are in need of food and other essential services, especially during the holidays. Prior to COVID-19, one in four San Francisco residents were at risk of hunger due to low income, and the global pandemic has disproportionately impacted these families even further. The San Francisco Human Services Agency has reported an additional 34,515 applications for food assistance programs since March. Additionally, San Franciscans who are most vulnerable to COVID and who are saying home as much as possible are feeling the negative mental health effects of isolation. To meet these urgent needs during the holiday season, Help Your Neighbors in Need is launching with a focus on food security and anti-isolation efforts, and is promoting ways that San Franciscans can volunteer safely and donate to support their fellow residents in need.
""In addition to daily meal deliveries to thousands of homebound seniors living in the City, our team of staff and volunteers have, and continue to be, a friendly voice on the other end of the phone for senior meal recipients letting them know that someone cares about them and they're not alone,"" said Ashley C. McCumber, CEO of Meals on Wheels San Francisco. ""With COVID, these essential services and friendly calls are more important than ever before. These phone calls help lessen the negative impacts of social isolation for older adults, which according to Meals on Wheels America's recent data, is associated with detrimental health impacts and an extra $6.7 billion in Medicare spending each year. We're excited the City is launching Help Your Neighbors in Need because organizations like ours throughout San Francisco need volunteers and philanthropic contributions to serve our clients and make sure people are taken care of during the holidays and year round.""
The We Will Recover Campaign, as well as each individual focus, will have a website and will use a combination of traditional media, social media, flyers/signs, and advertising to promote the key messages and offer individuals the information they need to take action. More information about We Will Recover is available online at: sf.gov/wewillrecover
Holidays at Home
The Holidays at Home Campaign incorporates multilingual public health guidance about Holiday Activities, Travel Advisories, and ideas about safe alternatives to traditional holiday activities. The choices people make this holiday season have direct impact on how many people will get sick and possibly die from COVID-19 this fall and winter. Staying at home and celebrating with your immediate household is the safest thing to do. Suggestions for safe and festive activities include preparing traditional family recipes with people you live with, hosting virtual holiday parties or creating decorations, crafts and greeting cards. San Franciscans are advised to avoid unnecessary travel and higher risk activities like holiday parties, large celebrations, and events that involve sharing food or drink especially if any of these activities occur indoors.

Shop and Dine in the 49
Shop and Dine in the 49 Mayor Breed's year-round campaign supporting local businesses managed by the Office of Economic and Workforce Development. This year the campaign features the Shared Spaces program and commercial corridors that have been closed to vehicles in order to facilitate outdoor shopping and dining opportunities. The Shop and Dine website will include a link to a map of all establishments permitted for outdoor operations through the Shared Spaces program and beginning Thanksgiving day, three Shared Spaces corridors in three opportunity neighborhoods will be decorated and offer prizes for shoppers such as reusable tote bags and face masks. The neighborhoods include Excelsior, Chinatown, and Mission neighborhoods, all of which have seen a significant increase in retail vacancies over the last year. Additionally, a virtual social media feed of San Francisco based businesses that offer online and curbside pick-up options for holiday meal and gift shopping will be available through the Shop and Dine in the 49 website. For more information, visit: www.shopdine49.com
Help your Neighbors in Need
Help your Neighbors in Need features San Francisco-based volunteering opportunities focused on food security and anti-isolation efforts during the holidays and into the new year. The site lists a range of volunteer opportunities with non-profit organizations that are working to provide food access and anti-isolation support to San Francisco residents. Help Your Neighbors in Need offers both in-person and virtual volunteer options. For those who prefer to donate to philanthropic efforts, the site offers San Francisco based giving campaigns that support San Francisco non-profit organizations, including the City's Give2SF Fund.

Good Morning, Mission! Welcome to Virus Village, your daily Covid-19 data dump.
NOTE: We have had some technical issues with one of the data viz graphs. We are working around and hope to have it fixed soon.
The Vaccine didn't come this morning. Though another reason for hope did arrive. Don't start hugging and throwing away your masks just yet. There are still outstanding questions, including the logistics of getting the vaccine from lab to arm.
And let's not forget the side effects.
Scroll down for today's Covid numbers.

If you think cases have quickly increased over the past month, you're right. Between October 14 and November 13, the Mission reported an eye-popping 250 new cases. The area bounded by Harrison and Bryant, 23rd and Cesar Chavez led with 29. The next hardest-hit neighborhoods were Bayview Hunters Point (190) and Excelsior (125). Though cases are rising Citywide, no other neighborhood had more than 95.

Covid-19 R Estimation for California raised its San Francisco R number estimate to 1.49 though an ensemble of models lowered the estimation slightly to 1.1. Most models suggest the current surge will not abate soon.

On November 8, the Citywide seven-day average number of daily cases in the City was 91, or 10.4 cases per 100,000 residents.



A good sign is that we have yet to see the rise in cases result in a big hospitalization jump. In fact, for the week ending November 14, DPH reports the rate of change in positive Covid patients dropped 2 percent! Over that week, the seven-day average availability of ICU beds was 35 percent and Acute Care beds 24 percent.


Only 40 percent of local cases have been traced to a known case. The others are considered ""unknown"" or ""community contact"" which means there's little data on where the new cases come from. As the Wall Street Journal points out, this problem exists beyond San Francisco.

DPH attributes 18 deaths to Pacific Heights. Bayview Hunters Point has 14, Japantown 12 and Tenderloin 11. Most of the City's neighborhoods, including the Mission, have less than 10. A number of neighborhoods, including Haight Ashbury, Hayes Valley and Mission Bay, report no deaths.

The development will provide wraparound supportive services and stable housing for 140 adults exiting homelessness
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the groundbreaking of a new housing complex at Mission Bay Block 9 (Block 9), a Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) development in the heart of Mission Bay. Once complete in late 2021, the building will add 140 homes to San Francisco's PSH portfolio, as well as a community garden open to residents and members of the larger Mission Bay community.
""As San Francisco recovers from COVID-19, it is critical that we create and acquire new Permanent Supportive Housing so we have stable, secure homes for people in need,"" said Mayor Breed. ""That's why we created our Homelessness Recovery Plan and why we funded projects like Block 9, which not only create new homes for formerly homeless residents, but also creates new construction jobs to help get our economy back on track.""
The development advances the City's strategy for economic recovery, which is centered in stimulating new job creation and investing in infrastructure that ensures San Francisco's post-COVID-19 economy emerges more equitable and resilient than before. Pursuing the development of 140 units of new affordable housing for San Francisco's most vulnerable residents makes progress on several recommendations made by the Economic Recovery Task Force and illustrates the City's efforts to retain and support its residents. Block 9 is part of Mayor Breed's Homelessness Recovery Plan, which will expand capacity in the City's Homelessness Response System and make 6,000 placements available for people experiencing homelessness over the next two years.
Block 9 is located within the Mission Bay South Redevelopment Project Area under the jurisdiction of the Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII), the former San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. The site has been designated as an ""Agency Affordable Housing Parcel"" and is part of the OCII's efforts to revitalize underutilized land.
""This housing project is not only going to give 140 people formerly experiencing homelessness a safe and stable place to call home, it's also going to enrich our Mission Bay community,"" said Supervisor Matt Haney. ""Mission Bay is a wonderful place to build a community that is for everyone in our city.""
The Mission Bay Project Area has seen many uses in its past, from warehouses and industrial facilities to the former Southern Pacific Railyard. Today it is one of San Francisco's newest mixed-use, transit-oriented developments, and upon completion will have approximately 6,500 housing units, of which 1,900 are affordable. The Mission Bay project is anticipated to wrap up over the next five to ten years and result in the construction of more than $700 million of new infrastructure, over $8 billion in private vertical development, and the creation of more than 30,000 permanent jobs.
""We know that housing is the solution to homelessness,"" said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, Interim Director, San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. ""Permanent Supportive Housing is a critical component of the Mayor's Homelessness Recovery Plan and the key to eradicating chronic homelessness in our community.""
""OCII strives to create inclusive neighborhoods that provide opportunities for individuals and families of all backgrounds and income levels,"" said Nadia Sesay, Executive Director, OCII. ""Block 9 is an important addition to the diverse and growing Mission Bay community. In addition to providing urgently-needed homes and supportive services, the project has been beautifully designed to facilitate connections among residents and neighbors. OCII looks forward to welcoming residents to Block 9 next year.""
Block 9 is a collaborative partnership between OCII, the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), BRIDGE Housing, Community Housing Partnership (CHP), and HealthRight 360. The development is employing factory-built housing unit construction in an effort to expedite the delivery of housing for formerly homeless individuals, and one of several City sponsored projects that is part of a factory-built housing pilot program.
""Community Housing Partnership is proud to be a partner with the City and BRIDGE Housing to create 140 permanent homes for people who have been experiencing homelessness,"" said Rick Aubry, CEO of Community Housing Partnership. ""By providing a stable place to live coupled with high quality supportive services, we can help people rebuild their lives, become self-sufficient and break the cycle of homelessness.""
""Right now, it's more important than ever for our most vulnerable neighbors to have a stable, affordable place to live,"" said Cynthia Parker, President and CEO of BRIDGE Housing. ""We're excited to see the building rise quickly with modular construction, and we're proud to partner on these new apartments that will end homelessness for many San Franciscans.""
Major financing for Block 9 was provided by a $37.2 million investment from OCII that enabled the $86.7 million project to move forward, as well as a state and federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit equity and a loan from the Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable Housing program. The units will be supported through a City-funded Local Operating Subsidy Program contract and homeless applicants will be referred to the development through the HSH Coordinated Entry System.

Good Morning, Mission! Welcome to Virus Village, your daily Covid-19 data dump.
New cases are on the rise in the Mission. See below.
It doesn't seem the best of times for a holiday gathering. Wired has some thoughts and a map on the subject for you to consider.
Senator Rand Paul, a self-certified opthamologist, smugly advised those who recover from the virus to go out and party. Besides drawing the ire of Dr. Fauci, many who ""recover"" may be too tired to celebrate. What is it about senators from Kentucky?
Scroll down for today's Covid numbers.

Between October 11 and November 9, 223 cases were reported in the Mission, by far the highest number since DPH started providing this information a couple months ago. Only Bayview Hunters Point (168)and Excelsior (103)added more than 100. Two neighborhoods west of Twin Peaks reported more than 50: Sunset/Parkside with 90 and the Outer Richmond with 53.

Covid-19 R Estimation for California continues to show the San Francisco R number at a very uncomfortable 1.44. An ensemble of other models, which had shown the local rate of transmission below or around 1, today estimates 1.11.

On Monday, Dr. Colfax correctly warned that local cases were beginning to rise exponentially. Take a look at the graph. On November 5, the seven-day average number of daily cases in the City rose to 81, or 9.3 cases per 100,000 residents. The number hasn't been this high since August 20.

&#65279;&#65279;
The rising average Citywide positivity rate suggests the virus won't be confined to any specific neighborhood or population group.


Reported Covid hospitalizations across the country reached the highest level since the pandemic began. In San Francisco the situation, though gradually worsening, is not yet as grim. The graph shows suspected as well as confirmed Covid patients. For the week ending November 11, the rate of weekly change in Covid positive patients rose 14 percent. Over that week, the seven-day average percentage of ICU beds available was 34 percent, while Acute Care availability was 23 percent.


Over 25 percent of the cases in the City are contracted by those between the ages 18 and 30. Eight-seven percent of the cases are those aged 60 or below.

Though they account for 13 percent of the cases, 88 percent of the deaths are those over 60

Due to a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases across the City and State, San Francisco will roll back non-essential offices and reduce capacity of gyms and fitness centers
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced the City will adjust its reopening of businesses and activities due to the continued increase in COVID-19 cases in San Francisco, which has resulted in the State placing the City in the more restrictive Red Tier. San Francisco will temporarily roll back the reopening of all non-essential offices and will reduce the capacity of fitness centers and gyms to a maximum capacity of 10%. These changes will go into effect on Tuesday, November 17, 2020.
San Francisco is rolling back these activities in compliance with the California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy tier assignments. San Francisco, the Bay Area, and California continue to experience a rapid and significant increase in COVID-19 cases. To adapt to the widespread rise in cases, the State has notified the counties that it is changing its reopening tier assignments. On Monday, 41 of the 58 counties will be assigned to the most restrictive Purple Tier, which prohibits many business and activities. The State has assigned San Francisco from the least restrictive Yellow Tier, where virus transmission is minimal, to the more restrictive Red Tier, where virus transmission is substantial.
""The increased rate of new COVID-19 cases in San Francisco means that we need to make some additional adjustments to slow the spread of the virus in our community. We need to make these hard choices now so that we can save lives and keep our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed,"" said Mayor Breed. ""In addition to these rollbacks, we need everyone to do their part to get COVID-19 under control, especially as we go into the holiday season. I know that people want to spend time with their family and friends this Thanksgiving, but this year we need to all stay home as much as possible, avoid unnecessary travel, and avoid gathering with people who don't live with us. I know it's difficult, but it's an important step we can each take to stay safe and protect the health of our entire community.""
The rolling back of certain businesses and activities is required by the State now that San Francisco has been assigned to the Red Tier. Due to its deliberate and strategic approach to reopening, San Francisco had only reopened a small number of activities allowed in the Orange Tier and only these activities are required to roll back. Non-essential offices which had been opened to 25% capacity on October 27th will need to close, and fitness centers will need to reduce their capacity to 10%, down from 25% capacity.
""San Francisco is in the midst of a major surge, and as we are seeing in communities across the country, it is moving aggressively,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax. ""Together, we have beaten back the virus twice before and we can do it again by taking the proper precautions. We must take every possible precaution to protect ourselves, our families and our community. Do not travel this holiday season. The choices we make in the next two weeks will save lives and determine the remainder of this holiday season. COVID-19 is not resting and neither can we.""
San Francisco is currently experiencing a surge in new cases rates. One of the key indicators of COVID-19 prevalence in the city, the number of new cases per day per 100,000 people, continues to climb from a low of 3.7 cases per 100,000 people to more than 10 cases per 100,000 people this week. From October 10 to November 10, daily new COVID cases jumped from a 7-day average of 29 cases per day to 97 cases per day.
San Francisco's increase in cases is significant but not unique. California has seen a significant increase in new positive cases over the last week and many counties have been re-assigned to more restrictive tiers on the State's system. Because of the widespread rise in cases, the State has notified the counties that it is changing its tier reassignment assignment in order to respond to changes in health indicators more immediately. Before this change, a county had to be in a tier for two consecutive weeks before the State re-assigned it to a more restrictive tier. Now a county will only need to be in that more restrictive tier for one week. Because of this change, San Francisco is moving from the least restrictive Yellow Tier to the Red Tier after only one week.
The following activities will halt indoor operations until further notice:
The following activities will be required to reduce indoor capacity:
All other businesses and activities that are currently allowed may continue operating this time within current applicable guidelines, including outdoor gyms and fitness centers, outdoor dining and take-out, elementary and middle schools, retail shopping, personal services, and cultural and family activities such as museums and aquariums.
The Department of Public Health will continue to closely monitor the City's case count, infection rate, and hospitalization rate in order to determine if additional activities need to be rolled back in order to contain the outbreak of the virus. The Department of Public Health released a Travel Advisory on November 12, urging San Franciscans to refrain from travelling outside of the county and recommending a 14-day quarantine for those who do choose to travel. As cases continue to climb throughout California and the rest of the country, this advisory is even more important to follow. The City strongly encourages San Franciscans to avoid gatherings, wear face coverings when leaving home, and keep their distance from other people, and to get tested for COVID-19 if they feel sick.

Beginning on Tuesday, November 17, the City will offer free, low-barrier testing fives day week at Alemany Farmer's Market
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced the CityTestSF COVID-19 testing site at the Alemany Farmer's Market will open tomorrow, Tuesday, November 17. CityTestSF resources are being reallocated from the SoMa testing site to the Alemany Farmer's Market as part of the City's strategic testing program.
CityTestSF at Alemany Farmer's Market will operate five days a week with the capacity to test as many as 500 people a day, which is the same testing capacity previously provided at the SoMa site. The City's testing program is designed to serve the populations and neighborhoods that are most highly impacted by the virus. The southeast sector of San Francisco carries a disproportionate virus burden and the reallocation of these 500 tests to that part of the city is a critical component for fighting the spread of the virus.
""Equity has been a priority for us throughout the pandemic, and part of having an equitable citywide response to COVID means that we direct our resources where there's the most need,"" said Mayor Breed. ""With the CityTestSF site at Alemany, we're making testing even easier for people to access right in their own neighborhood.""
Since the onset of the pandemic, San Francisco moved quickly and aggressively to establish a robust public COVID-19 testing program, with partners Color and Carbon Health. San Francisco currently tests more than 5,800 people each day, which is the highest rate among Bay Area counties. In addition to the two CityTestSF sites, the City continues to provide testing in the neighborhoods and for the populations most impacted by the virus. Through pop-up community testing sites, in partnership with community organizations and Color, the City has served two neighborhoods a day with testing resources. Additionally, the Department of Public Health has expanded testing at its community clinics and has partnered with the state on a testing site at the City College Bayview campus.
""We have to adapt our strategy to where the need is greatest and locating more high-capacity, low barrier testing to the most impacted part of the city is the smart strategy,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""As we experience a surge in cases in the city, the region and the nation, we must manage our public testing resources in the most efficient ways possible to slow the spread of the virus. Re-allocating these testing resources to the area of the city with highest rate of infection is critical to our response to the virus.""
The collaboration with Color and Carbon Health has enabled the City to quickly stand up testing sites where they are needed most, streamline scheduling and sample collection, distribute and track test kits, and efficiently return results to individuals and the Department of Public Health. Color has helped San Francisco become a national leader in turnaround time with 86% of results returned in less than 24 hours and 99% in less than 48 hours.
""Our partnership with San Francisco has helped to create a model for the rest of the country to follow,"" said Othman Laraki, CEO, Color. ""Since we began working together in April, we are providing nearly 4,000 tests a day by building a testing program that's easy for anyone in San Francisco to access, simple to navigate, and will dependably return results in less than 24 hours. This program is the foundation of a strong public health response and critical to managing the virus in communities most affected.""
San Francisco has the highest testing rate per capita of any other city in the United States. The City currently administers and funds 55 percent of all COVID-19 tests conducted in San Francisco, with the intention of testing people most at risk for COVID‑19. CityTestSF prioritizes testing for essential workers and residents who have symptoms or who have been exposed to the virus. If you have insurance, schedule a test with your doctor.
During this current surge, city resources will not support testing for travel or visitations. Tests are set aside for essential workers, close contacts identified through contract tracing, and for the City's first responders. Appointments are released on a rolling basis.
The Alemany CityTestSF low-barrier testing facility, located on 100 Alemany Boulevard, will provide COVID-19 testing five days per week, with both walk-through and drive-through tests. Appointments can be scheduled online at sf.gov/gettestedsf and residents or essential workers without appointments are welcome.
The hours of Alemany CityTestSF are:
Testing is a part of the City's COVID-19 response, but every San Franciscan must also focus on prevention. The most important things that every person can do to slow the spread of the virus are: wear a face covering outside their homes; avoid gathering with people outside your household; continue to stay home as much as possible; stay six feet apart from others when not home; and always wash hands frequently.
If you have symptoms or have been exposed, you should get tested. If you have insurance, call your doctor first. For more information on testing options, please visit: sf.gov/gettestedsf.

Good Morning, Mission! Welcome to Virus Village, your daily Covid-19 data dump.
If you believe the R number indicates the current and near-future local spread of the virus, pull up your mask. The effective R number for San Francisco according to Covid-19 R Estimation for California, is approximately 1.53, the level it at this past July.
Although the big news yesterday was all about the positive results from Pfizer vaccine trials, there was more good news on the Covid front. Lab results from Abbot's new rapid test (first studied in the Mission) were very enccouraging, and the FDA gave emergency approval to a treatment which may keep people at high risk out of the hospital.
Locally, the concept of Community Wellness Teams, which has found success in the Mission, may finally get some support from the City.
For those interested in a deeper dive into San Francisco's Covid data, check out the Phoenix Data Project
Scroll down for today's Covid numbers.

Last month a single census tract in the Mission (bounded by 17th, 22nd, Valencia and South Van Ness) recorded a positive case rate of 53.1 cases per 10,000 residents, a higher rate than any entire neighborhood in the City (including the Mission). The Citywide average rate for the month was 16.6 cases per 10,000 residents.

The model we use is generally high in its R number estimates compared to other models. An ensemble of other models estmates the transmission rate at .98, though one of those models has been consistently very low.

However you judge the models estimating the R number, positive cases are on the rise. For the week ending November 2, the Citywide seven-day average number of daily cases rose to 60 or 6.9 cases per 100,000, higher than we've seen since late September.

A rising rate of positive cases in the White and Asian communities joins the recent rise Latinx cases over the past couple weeks.
&#65279;&#65279;
Though still relatively low, the Citywide average positivity rate has noticeably risen over the past two weeks.

California's positivity rate continues its upward trend.

The increasing R number, case numbers and positivity rate have yet to show up in the hospital. The raw number of confirmed and suspected Covid patients remains relatively steady, though the number of confirmed patients rose 13 percent compared to a week ago. For the week ending November 8, the seven-day average percentage of ICU beds available was 34 percent, Acute Care 24 percent.


We don't know where the majority of new cases are coming from. Only 40 percent of the City's cases can be traced to a known case.

By Katie King
WASHINGTON D.C. — California Sen. Kamala Harris will soon be sworn in as vice president, and a handful of local legislators could be tapped to fill the senate seat she will leave behind.
""We are working through the cattle call of considerations,"" Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said this week. ""I want to make sure it's inclusive. I want to make sure that we are considerate of people's points of view.""
Among the local lawmakers believed to be on the governor's list: Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, Rep. Ro Khanna of Fremont, Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.
Khanna, a former law and economics professor, was first elected to Congress in 2016. As part of the Democratic party's progressive wing, he frequently advocates for tuition-free college, Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. The congressman also served as the national co-chair for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.
""Ro is keeping all his options open and is so appreciative of all the support he's received,"" Heather Purcell, the congressman's deputy chief of staff and communications director, told San Jose Spotlight.
The American Indian Impact Fund endorsed Khanna earlier this week, praising his commitment to universal healthcare and his expertise in manufacturing and technology. As an Indian American, Khanna would also represent one of the fastest growing communities in California, the
organization said.
Schaaf, a former attorney and public affairs director, was elected mayor of Oakland in 2015. Last year, Newsom appointed her to California's first Council of Regional Homeless Advisors.
Schaaf said this week it was an honor to be considered for the senate.
""My appreciation of the role of federal government has never been higher since we've been in this health crisis,"" she said. ""Clearly it is the honor of a lifetime to be a United States senator from California. But I am also very cognizant that there are some very, very qualified people on the
list.""
Breed was elected mayor of San Francisco two years ago and is the first Black woman to ever serve in the role. She garnered national praise this year for taking early and aggressive action to stop the spread of COVID-19.
Lee, who has served in Congress for more than two decades, is part of the Democratic party's progressive wing. The congresswoman is known as an advocate for peace, as she was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War. She has also described Harris as a close friend.
Some other possible contenders throughout the state include Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, Rep. Karen Bass of Los Angeles and Rep. Katie Porter of Orange County.
Bill James, the chair of the Santa Clara County Democratic Party, said the state is fortunate to have so many talented candidates. The SCCDP currently is not endorsing anyone but he said he believes most Democratic activists hope the governor will chose a progressive who supports universal
health care, reproductive rights and an aggressive approach to fighting climate change.
""There also seems to be a lot of interest for the governor to name someone who will represent the diversity of California,"" he said. Local Latino and LGBTQ+ organizations are lobbying the governor for a pick that represents their communities.
James added he personally hopes the governor will select a candidate who wants to remain in the senate for years to come, as opposed to a seat holder who only intends to finish the remainder of Harris's term, which expires in 2022.
Angel Martinez, the president of Silicon Valley Young Democrats, said the organization will be discussing whom to support at a general meeting Nov. 16.
""(We do hope) Newsom will pick an individual that will not only embody the changing racial demographic of California, but also help represent the newer generation of Democrats who will eventually take over the mantle of leadership in the party,"" Martinez said.
According to a poll from the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, a majority of voters (76 percent) are looking for a ""fresh and new"" voice in politics to fill Harris's seat. About 23 percent said they would prefer a candidate with experience in Sacramento, as opposed to 29 percent who said they would prefer a candidate with experience in Washington. However, most voters (48 percent)
said they would favor a candidate who was not part of the political scene in either city.
Most voters (52 percent) said appointing a ""historic first"" should not be a priority.

City will send 20 Disaster Service Workers to support District staff with classroom assessments to prepare for school reopening
San Francisco, CA — Under an agreement between the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) and the City and County of San Francisco, the City will be sending staff to help support the District's school facility assessments. The District has assessed 20 schools and has an additional 65 buildings that need to be inspected to meet the goal of having its youngest students and other vulnerable student groups back in the classroom.
The District is working with the City's COVID-19 Command Center to deploy 20 City Disaster Service Workers (DSWs) starting the week of November 16 to form School Site Assessment Teams. Disaster Service Workers are City employees from departments who perform varying emergency-related services across the City, from staffing the Emergency Operations Center to working at food banks.
The School Site Assessment Team will work with district staff to assess school facilities on a classroom by classroom basis for their readiness to receive students and staff for in-person learning during this pandemic. These evaluations will include things like operability of classroom windows; type of classroom furniture; presence of functional hand washing sinks; and basic working condition of the classroom, for example window shades and classroom light fixtures. These Site Assessment Teams will provide valuable data on school site readiness for a hybrid or full in-person learning school day.
""We know that opening our public schools is going to be challenging, but the City is ready to do what we can to help get our kids back in schools starting in January,"" said Mayor Breed. ""By sending City staff over to help with school building assessments, we can speed up the work that needs to be done to make sure our classrooms are safe and healthy places for our kids and our teachers. The City will continue to find ways to support the District's plans to open in whatever way we can because nothing matters more than ensuring that our children and our families are supported during this challenging time.""
""While SFUSD conducts annual inspections and regular maintenance related to classroom operability, new inspections are necessary in order to assess conditions in the context of COVID health and safety,"" said Superintendent Dr. Vincent Matthews. ""We've completed these site assessments at several school sites but there are dozens more to go. We are grateful to have the City's partnership to conduct site assessments quickly and thoroughly so we can make any needed adjustments as soon as possible.""
SFUSD Superintendent Matthews shared that the district has a target date of January 25 for a return to in-person learning for the district's youngest learners and a group of elementary school students who receive special education services if public health indicators and numerous other prerequisites are in place.
The City and school district continue to discuss other ways the City can support SFUSD with returning to in-person learning. At the recent Board of Education meeting, the School Board members voted to enter into an agreement with Curative, a testing company that will support the District's plans for having a testing program that meets the needs for reopening. A testing program, along with ensuring classrooms are ready, are key steps in preparing for reopening.

Good Morning, Mission! Welcome to Virus Village, your daily Covid-19 data dump.
Amidst cheering and horn honking in the neighborhood this morning, Biden plans to start pandemic response immediately.
Though the Presidential election has finally been called, a couple local elections remain too close to call.
For the first time, non-citizens can serve on SF Commissions and advisory boards.
Scroll down for today's Covid numbers.
HiGeorge, a data visualization startup, developed some new visualizations for Mission Local, which we will be using and fine-tuning in the days to come.

The rate of positive cases in the Mission more than doubles the Citywide rate. As of November 4, The Mission reportedly had 1819 cases or a rate of 30.5 cases per 1000 residents.

It may be time to celebrate an election victory, but no time to celebrate a victory over the virus. Though other indicators remain more or less stable, over the past week, the effective R model we use now estimates the number to be 1.35, approaching where we were last June and suggesting a rocky road ahead.

For the week ending October 30, the Citywide seven-day average number of daily cases was 51 or 5.9 cases per 100,000, essentially flat for the last three days when figures are considered ""more reliable.""

&#65279;&#65279;
The rapid rise in the R number is not showing up in the average Citywide positivity rate which, though higher than last month, remains relatively very low.


Hospitalizations of suspected and confirmed Covid patients has risen a bit but has been basically stable since October 27. The good news is that for the week ending November 5, the rate of weekly change in confirmed Covid patients (a DPH ""key indicator"") decreased by 4 percent. Over that same week the seven-day average percentage of ICU beds was 38 percent, and for Acute Care beds 24 percent.


The percentage of cases has dropped below 49 percent for the first time.

Assuming the death toll still stands at 151 (it's probably higher), the case fatality rate is approximately 1.2 percent.

120,/california/san-francisco/ca-could-decriminalize-psychedelic-drugs-under-new-bill,2020-11-11T21:30:33Z,CA Could Decriminalize Psychedelic Drugs Under...,0,3,Kat Schuster,Patch Staff,"SAN FRANCISCO, CA — Psychedelic drugs could be decriminalized in California as soon as next year with the introduction of a new bill. State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) announced Tuesday that he will introduce a bill to decriminalize the possession of psychedelics when the legislature reconvenes.
Over the last several years, amounting evidence from researchers has revealed that psilocybin, the hallucinogenic component of ""magic"" mushrooms and similar drugs, could be used to treat depression and anxiety.
""These drugs have been shown to have medicinal value treating depression, PTSD and other conditions,"" Wiener tweeted Tuesday.
The Golden State would be joining Oregon, where residents voted last week to decriminalize and ultimately legalize psilocybin. The District of Columbia also voted to decriminalize the compound.
""There's strong support for ending the failed War on Drugs, which criminalizes communities of color and those suffering from addiction,"" Wiener tweeted Tuesday. ""People need treatment, not prison.""
Wiener said he is working with Assembly members Evan Low (D-Campbell) and Sydney Kamlager (D-Los Angeles) on the bill.
The 2020 election saw voters take significant steps toward decriminalizing drugs across many states, as Arizona, New Jersey, South Dakota, Mississippi and Montana all passed legislation to legalize marijuana, according to multiple reports.
And Oregon didn't just vote to decriminalize psychedelics, it became the first state to decriminalize possession of all personal use drugs, including small amounts of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines. This means the punishment for holding such drugs will not result in jail time, but such possessions could still be be ticketed.
Oakland also adopted a resolution last year that decriminalized natural psychedelic compounds that are derived from plants and fungi.
Meanwhile, Washington D.C. residents voted to also decriminalize such compounds from plants and fungi, but Congress could still overturn this law.
While California has a long way to go before joining Oregonians in this significant of a change, Wiener's proposed legislation could be a step in that direction.
Psychiatry Professor Mathew Johnson of Johns Hopkins University, who has researched the possible pharmaceutical uses of psychedelics since 1996, says that psychedelics could transform the field of psychiatry, Fast Company reported last week.
A January study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, demonstrated that a single psilocybin dose was able to produce an antidepressant and anxiolytic response in cancer patients that lasted for five years.
""Participants overwhelmingly (71–100%) attributed positive life changes to the psilocybin-assisted therapy experience and rated it among the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives,"" researchers wrote in the study.
Another research paper, from Johns Hopkins, in 2018 also revealed that psilocybin has a ""low potential for abuse.""
""When rats push a lever to receive psilocybin, they don't keep pushing the lever like they do for drugs such as cocaine, alcohol or heroin,"" researchers from Johns Hopkins wrote in the study.
""We should be clear that psilocybin is not without risks of harm, which are greater in recreational than medical settings, but relatively speaking, looking at other drugs both legal and illegal, it comes off as being the least harmful in different surveys and across different countries,"" Johnson wrote in the 2018 study."

December 04, 2020
Due to the aggressive increase in COVID-19 cases and continuing rise in hospitalizations across the city and region, Bay Area counties will voluntarily implement the State's Regional Stay at Home order to significantly reduce gatherings and additional activities in an effort to stabilize COVID-19 ca
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax today announced San Francisco will join counties across the Bay Area to impose significant restrictions across the region in an effort to mitigate the current surge in COVID-19 cases. The City's case rate and hospitalizations continue to increase unabated since late October and are now prompting San Francisco to take further action.
San Francisco and the other Bay Area Counties are opting into the Regional Stay at Home Order that Governor Newsom announced Thursday, December 3rd for regions with less than 15% capacity in ICU beds. Although San Francisco and the Bay Area have not yet met that threshold, the City in partnership with Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Santa Clara and City of Berkeley, is preemptively implementing these restrictions in an effort to flatten the curve of COVID-19 cases, which continue to surge, and prevent hospitals from being overrun across the region.
As of 10 p.m. on Sunday, December 6, San Francisco will close all personal services, outdoor dining, public outdoor playgrounds, outdoor museums, zoos and aquariums, drive-in theaters, and open-air tour busses and boats. Additionally, San Francisco will halt indoor limited personal training in gyms and limit outdoor gyms and outdoor fitness classes to a maximum group size of 12 people at a time, including instructors and participants. Low contact retail such as pet grooming, electronics or shoe repair services, may only operate in a curbside drop-off context. All other retail, including grocery stores must reduce capacity to 20%, and all indoor businesses that are open to the public, such as retail stores, must create a metering system to manage and enforce indoor customer capacity. This metering system must be in place no later 10 p.m. on Sunday December 6, when other amended order becomes operative.
Hotels may remain open for essential workers and critical infrastructure support, including isolation and quarantine. Out of town visitors who are not essential workers or here for critical infrastructure support must stay in the hotel for the full amount of time required to quarantine. Real Estate viewings must take place virtually. The City will limit any outdoor gatherings to members of the same household up to 12 people.
""Given the steep increase in COVID-19 cases in San Francisco, we must do whatever is necessary in order to get the virus under control,"" said Mayor Breed. ""This is about protecting people's lives. We see how quickly it moves and how devastating the effects. We need to do everything we can to prevent our hospital system from becoming overwhelmed and to save lives. We know that the faster we flatten the curve, the less time it takes us to move out of the danger zone. We are taking these actions now in order to contain the spread in our communities, and I urge everyone to take this very seriously.""
San Francisco, along with California and the United Sates, is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 more aggressive than what the City has experienced to date. Local COVID-19 cases have quadrupled during the last month. San Francisco is currently averaging 142 new COVID-19 positive cases per day compared to the 34 per day that it averaged in late October. Moreover, the City currently has approximately 900 COVID-19 cases diagnosed per week and hospitalizations have tripled over the last month. As a result, the City's hospital capacity will be under considerable stress. At its current rate of COVID hospitalizations, the City would run out of hospital beds by December 26. Unlike in previous surges, the rest of the State's hospital capacity is strained and reaching patient limits and it is unlikely there will be additional hospital capacity in other counties if San Francisco's is compromised.
""We are in our worst surge yet of COVID-19. It is stressing health care systems across the state of California and taxing our health care workers,"" said Dr. Colfax. ""We need urgent intervention now if we want to be able to care for the sick in mid-to-late December. We do not want your parent, your spouse, your child, your grandparent or any loved one to be in need of help and our hospitals too overwhelmed to properly care for them.""
San Francisco's Health Order is expected to be in effect through January 4, 2021. If, after a week of this order being in effect, the City's indicators show a consistent reduction in case rates and hospitalizations for three additional weeks (for a total of 4 weeks) and ICU capacity is holding at 25% availability or more, San Francisco will lift this health order. If however, the Bay Area continues on its current trajectory and reaches the 15% ICU capacity threshold, it would trigger the State's Regional Stay at Home Order and mandate that the region continue these restrictions for at least 3 weeks from that time and until ICU capacity exceeds 15% and forward-looking indicators would allow easing the restrictions. In either scenario, once this order is lifted, San Francisco would be returned to the State's blueprint tier system.
In addition to the measures the City is taking in order to reduce close interactions by people from different households, the City is increasing its focus on compliance and enforcement activities. In an effort to promote responsible behavior in higher risk contexts, such as high traffic areas in neighborhoods experiencing increasing case rates, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development has funded the Creative Corps, a pilot program to deploy community health ambassadors to street closure locations. Additionally, the City's Community Education and Response Team (CERT) is addressing complaints regarding Health Order violations to ensure that business owners and operators are fully aware of and adhere to health orders and directives. Further, with expanding contact tracing capabilities and infection monitoring efforts, CERT is strategically focusing its proactive outreach and education efforts to business corridors in areas of the City with high infection rates, low compliance, and/or elevated risks.
The following activities will be required to suspend operations until further notice:
The following activities will be required to restrict their operations:
The following activities will be required to proceed with modifications in place:

Harlan Kelly's charge is part of an ongoing federal investigation into city corruption, which has already netted several city officials suspected of accepting bribes in exchange for lucrative city contract bids.
Harlan Kelly has since stepped down from the position.
In a letter to staff, Naomi Kelly said she'd be taking a leave absence for the next six weeks to focus on her family, including her two young sons. ""My focus is on the important work of supporting my family at this time,"" she said.
Deputy City Administrator Ken Bukowski will serve as acting city administrator while City Administrator Kelly is on leave.
In response to the announcement, Mayor London Breed said, ""While Naomi has not been charged with any crimes, managing our COVID response while still delivering basic city services requires the full focus of all of our departments, including the city administrator's office, which has been central to many of our efforts to mitigate the spread of this disease.""
Breed added, ""As a city, we need to continue to work to address issues raised by this investigation and to implement necessary reforms in order to ensure the public's trust in our city government.""
The city administrator is the city's highest non-elected city official, overseeing 25 city departments, divisions and programs, including the Public Works Department, the County Clerk Office, the Medical Examiner's Office and Animal Care and Control, among others.
Federal prosecutors allege Harlan Kelly, 58, was involved in a ""long-running bribery scheme and corrupt partnership"" with construction company executive Walter Wong in which Wong provided Kelly with cash, international vacations and meals, as Wong sought a multi-million-dollar contract for his company.
Prosecutors also said Wong, who has since pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, told federal investigators he paid for a 2016 trip to China for Harlan and Naomi Kelly and their family and gave them jewelry.
In exchange, Harlan Kelly allegedly provided Wong with confidential information and offered to delay the bidding process as Wong's company drafted a contract proposal. Harlan Kelly becomes one of several people charged under the FBI's public corruption investigation, including former Recology group government and community relations manager Paul Fredrick Giusti and former Department of Public Works director Mohammed Nuru.
Harlan Kelly's attorney Brian Getz has stressed his client's innocence.

San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed, the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH), the San Francisco Interfaith Council (SFIC), and Episcopal Community Services (ECS) today announced the opening of the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program. Now in its 32nd year, the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program opened today, Monday, November 30, 2020, increasing shelter capacity for people experiencing homelessness during the winter season.
""Our Homelessness Recovery Plan will create thousands of new placements for homeless residents in order to bring them off the streets and into housing, but there continues to be an immediate need for more places for people to go. That is why the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program is so important,"" said Mayor Breed. ""The winter season can be particularly difficult for people experiencing homelessness and it is our responsibility as a city to make sure that everyone has a safe place to sleep at night. We are grateful to our local faith organizations for opening their doors and making this program possible.""
The Interfaith Winter Shelter Program will serve 67 individuals experiencing homelessness at St. Mary's Cathedral beginning November 30, 2020 – January 31, 2021. At present, the end date of the program is January 31, 2021 as the site's availability is contingent upon the status of the pandemic. HSH and Interfaith Winter Shelter Program Partners will continue to closely monitor the landscape of the pandemic while exploring other options to support winter shelter resources being available through the winter months. The program will provide guests with two hot meals and takeaway lunches and mobile showers will be provided.
""For over three decades the San Francisco Interfaith Council has hosted the San Francisco Interfaith Winter Shelter, in collaboration with the City and County of San Francisco and Episcopal Community Services,"" said Michael Pappas, Executive Director, San Francisco Interfaith Council. ""Traditionally, the shelter has transitioned among four religious facilities with meals prepared and served by over 50 congregations. COVID-19 health precautions require a very different model for the 2020-2021 season. We are grateful to the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption for generously offering their site as an extended stay location. This location and the ongoing leadership of the City and ECS means that the Interfaith Winter Shelter may continue to operate at this critical time.""
The Interfaith Winter Shelter Program will adhere to COVID-19 public health guidance for congregate-style shelters that includes but is not limited to:
ECS has been providing the services for the Interfaith Winter Shelter for the last 32 years and is funded by HSH to provide services at the 2020-2021 Interfaith Winter Shelter Program.
""The shelter capacity expansion that the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program will bring to our homelessness emergency response system is critical,"" said Beth Stokes, Executive Director, Episcopal Community Services. ""ECS is proud to partner for our 32nd year with the City and the San Francisco Interfaith Council on this initiative. It is of the utmost importance that vulnerable members of our community are not only able to seek respite from the elements, but Shelter-In-Place in a safe and dignified manner.""
Based on COVID-19 public health guidance for congregate-style shelters, the 2020-2021 Interfaith Winter Shelter Program will not accept walk-ins. All referrals to the Interfaith Winter Shelter Program will be made through the centralized referral process managed by the COVID‑19 Command Center.
""My deepest gratitude to the San Francisco Interfaith Council, Episcopal Community Services, St. Mary's Cathedral and the faith community for meeting the challenges of this difficult year, to provide expanded congregate shelter capacity and warm meals this winter,"" said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, Interim Director of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing.

With our partners, and in a COVID informed manner, this winter we will continue to offer each guest dignity, meals and connection to the City's larger Homelessness Response System.""

San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today issued the following statement following the resignation of San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) General Manager Harlan Kelly.
""Today, I accepted Harlan Kelly's resignation as General Manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The allegations detailed in the Federal Investigation conducted by the US Attorney's Office are disturbing and unacceptable for anyone serving in our government, let alone the leader of one of our largest departments. As public officials, we have to hold ourselves to the highest standard and put the public good before all else. As I've said from the beginning, any City employee involved in issues related to this investigation needs to cooperate and come forward with any information. At this time, SFPUC Deputy General Manager Michael Carlin will serve as Acting General Manager of the SFPUC and I have asked the SFPUC Commission to undergo a national search for a permanent replacement.""

November 30, 2020
Partnership between the Department of Public Health and Fire Department begins with first SCRT Team on the street today with more teams to come as pilot ramps up. SCRT offers a non-police response to calls related to people suffering from mental health and substance use issues on City streets.
San Francisco, CA — Mayor London N. Breed today announced the launch of the first phase of San Francisco's Street Crisis Response Team (SCRT) pilot program. The first team will begin responding to 911 calls regarding people experiencing behavioral health crises today. The Street Crisis Response Team is part of San Francisco's efforts to develop alternatives to police responses to non-violent calls, which advances the Mayor's roadmap to fundamentally change the way that the City handles public safety, and is also a major step in implementing Mental Health SF.
The SCRT pilot program is a collaboration between the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Francisco Fire Department with significant support from the Department of Emergency Management. The San Francisco Police Department will also be a key partner in the transition of certain types of 911 calls to the new teams. Each team includes a community paramedic, a behavioral health clinician, and a behavioral health peer specialist. The goal of the new program is to provide an appropriate non-law enforcement response to behavioral health emergencies in San Francisco and divert individuals in crisis away from emergency rooms and criminal legal settings into behavioral health treatment. The SCRT aims to provide trauma-informed clinical interventions and care coordination for people who experience behavioral health crises on the streets of San Francisco.
""This new program can help us break the cycle that all too often keeps people going in and out of our emergency rooms or our jails. When the Street Crisis Response Team responds to a call for someone in crisis, they'll be able to help with compassion and clinical skills to get people the care and support they need,"" said Mayor Breed. ""Changing the way we respond to non-violent calls is going to take work and it's going to take time. The SCRT is an important first step in our long-term effort to change how we respond to people suffering on our streets.""
The program's first team starts today, Monday, November 30, 2020, and will initially operate Monday-Friday, from 10am-6pm. This first team will focus on responding to calls in the Tenderloin, which will allow the SCRT to respond efficiently to calls in a high-need and relatively small geographic area during the initial phase of the program. Additional teams will be phased in over the coming weeks and months, ramping up to at least six teams by the end of March 2021, with the goal of enabling the SCRT to operate citywide, 7 days per week and up to 24 hours a day.
The team is dispatched to address calls for service by the 911 call center. Through pairing behavioral health specialists and medical professionals, the Street Crisis Response Team can begin to respond to some of the calls that the SFPD currently answers. While the first phase will focus on calls involving ""mentally disturbed adults,"" the objective of the pilot program is to respond to additional calls regarding behavioral health over time. In addition, individuals will be connected to services and supported by DPH to ensure follow-up care is coordinated.
""We are proud to be adding this model to the existing crisis response services at the Department of Public Health. Particularly important is including a team member with lived experience of behavioral health challenges to this service,"" said Dr. Grant Colfax, Director of Health. ""Over time, we will build on what we learn from this first team and be able to connect more people in crisis to trauma-informed care.""
""The San Francisco Fire Department has been a pioneer in the field of community paramedicine,"" said Chief Jeanine Nicholson of the San Francisco Fire Department. ""The fire department's EMS-6 team, through trauma-informed engagement and compassionate advocacy, has for the last five years led the way in connecting vulnerable people to definitive care for acute medical, mental health and social needs. The Street Crisis Response Team will continue the innovation on a larger scale and the collaboration with the Department of Public Health will facilitate access to care for those experiencing behavioral crises on our streets.""
The service model for the Street Crisis Response Team is unique in the incorporation of a behavioral health peer specialist who has lived experience of homelessness, mental illness, and/or substance use disorder. Peer specialists are people who have been successful in the recovery process and are skilled to help others experiencing similar situations. DPH has contracted with HealthRIGHT360 to hire the behavioral health clinicians and with RAMS, Inc. (Richmond Area Multi-Services) to hire the behavioral health peer specialists. This team will coordinate with other street outreach teams including the Department of Public Health's Street Medicine team, the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing's Homeless Outreach Team, and the Fire Department's EMS-6 team.
As the SCRT program is phased in, the Police Department will continue responding to calls that are non-violent, and/or behavioral health-related, since the single team will not be able to respond to all the behavioral health crisis calls received. However, once the pilot program is fully ramped up by the end of March, the City expects that SCRT teams will be able to respond to approximately 17,000 calls for service per year, which is equivalent to the number of non-violent ""mentally disturbed person"" calls to which the Police Department currently responds.
In June, Mayor Breed announced that the City is in the process of creating a system to divert non-violent calls from the Police Department to other first responders. Establishing a Street Crisis Response Team is an essential part of this system and enables appropriate calls to be directed toward behavioral health and medical professionals. Mayor Breed has convened the Alternatives to Policing Steering Committee to help guide the City's process for identifying alternatives to police response for non-violent calls to 911 and 311.
The Street Crisis Response Team pilot program is part of the first phase of implementation of Mental Health SF, the City's strategic framework for improving the behavioral health response to people experiencing homelessness. In addition to funding the Street Crisis Response Team, the City's budget for Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 includes funding to establish an Office of Coordinated Care within the Department of Public Health, increasing behavioral health bed capacity to reduce wait times to access treatment beds, and expanding service hours at the Behavioral Health Access Center.
