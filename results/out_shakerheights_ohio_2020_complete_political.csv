The resolution expresses ""outrage at the murder of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department.""
The resolution has six main sections, each making a separate statement about recent events.
The full resolution can be viewed on the city's website.
Last week, Shaker Heights Mayor David Weiss pledged to work towards racial justice in the community.
""We seek to strengthen established partnerships and create new ones that will help us as a community to deepen our understanding and sharpen our focus on systemic racism, and to help us do the hard work of reevaluating systems and structures that create barriers for people of color,"" Weiss said."

Weiss penned an open letter to Shaker Heights residents on Monday. The letter came amid the deployment of the Ohio National Guard and the implementation of a curfew in neighboring Cleveland.
""I pledge to continue to work towards racial justice and equal opportunity for all by being an ally, by listening and engaging in open and honest dialogue, by learning, by standing up, by speaking out and by taking action. I commit to re-double our efforts to make these goals a priority for the city across all departments and at every level,"" Weiss said in his letter.
Saturday's protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd died after being arrested by Minneapolis police. Video of his arrest shows officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, while Floyd repeatedly says he ""cannot breathe."" Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday.
Protests broke out across the U.S., including in Columbus and Cleveland, following Floyd's death. While much of Cleveland's protest was peaceful, some protesters began burning police cruisers and destroying city property.
Weiss said he wants Shaker Heights to be an anti-racist community, where everyone can feel welcome.
""We will begin by re-engaging with the wide range of existing community groups working on equity issues so that we can establish a structure for moving forward together. We seek to strengthen established partnerships and create new ones that will help us as a community to deepen our understanding and sharpen our focus on systemic racism, and to help us do the hard work of reevaluating systems and structures that create barriers for people of color,"" Weiss said.
Weiss said he will also continue to look for ways to diversify the Shaker Heights police department and will emphasize de-escalation training.
""We are fortunate to have police leadership that is fully committed to this work and to working in partnership with the community. We will lean into what we stand for here in Shaker: equity and inclusion in all ways and across all systems, and for all residents,"" Weiss said."

While the results have yet to be verified by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, unofficial tallies have the levy passing by a vote of 4,763 to 4,432. That would fall outside of automatic recount territory, with the levy receiving 51.80 percent of the vote.
The library asked residents to support a 1.9-mill levy during the May 8, 2018 primary. It was the library's first request for funding in nearly two decades and residents responded by granting the library's request.
The library system said that revenue from the state has declined 19 percent since 2008, while revenue from the existing property tax levy dropped 18 percent over the same time frame. Almost two-thirds of the library's funding comes from property taxes.
The levy was not without its opponents. A group calling itself the Committee for the Future of the Shaker Heights Library urged residents to vote against the levy. The thrust of their argument was that the levy being presented to voters would not ensure the long-term viability of the library. Instead, the group wanted library leaders to consider joining the Cuyahoga County system.
Results from the May 8 primary election voting on the levy are below.

With COVID-19 still threatening the populace, Ohio's general election could be less busy than ever. Approximately 5.5 million Ohioans voted overall in 2016. Nearly 3 million early votes have already been cast in Ohio.
After early concern about lacking sufficient poll workers for Nov. 3, Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced 56,789 Ohioans have been trained to work the general election. The statewide goal for the election was to have 55,165 trained poll workers.
However, five counties had not yet met their minimum number of poll workers by Oct. 30: Ashtabula, Greene, Jackson, Pike, and Vinton.
""Ohioans are stepping up to serve as poll workers this election season at a pace never seen before, showing the world the civic engagement and can-do sense of public service our state has always exemplified,"" LaRose said. ""We will continue supporting our counties however we can, while holding the bipartisan board of elections accountable, so that voters who haven't already cast their ballot will have a safe and positive experience at their polling locations next Tuesday.""
Early Voting
Early voting for the upcoming general election began Oct. 6 in Ohio. Early in-person voting ended Monday. Nearly 3 million early votes have been cast in Ohio, according to the U.S. Elections Project.
In 2016, 1.8 million absentee ballots were cast in Ohio.
Election officials can begin scanning absentee ballots as they are received, but those votes are not tabulated until the polls close at 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 3.
Each one of Ohio's 88 counties had its own designated site for in-person early voting. For most counties, that site was the county board of elections.

City and police officials announced the completion of the initial stage of work on Friday. Revised policies, including the city's response to threats policy, will be finalized by Nov. 30.
Weiss called for the review following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis officers earlier this year. At the time, Weiss signed the Obama Foundation Pledge, which calls for police departments and cities across the country to review and reform use of force policies and to engaged community members to gain a diverse collection of opinions when forming police policy.
Shaker Heights Police Chief Jeff DeMuth reviewed the first round of policy changes with city council members in a work session this week. At the meeting, DeMuth said that the department has remained in strict compliance and ahead of the curve with law enforcement gold standard accreditation standards and that this process represents another step in the department best serving the community.
Included in outlined changes made in the Shaker Heights police department's use of force policy is prohibiting chokeholds by police officers except in ""life-threatening situations when the use of deadly force would be considered reasonable."" The new policy also addresses certain language in policies in the use of reasonable force when de-escalating situations and includes new sanctity of life language that will take effect once the new policies are instituted.
In a news release issued Friday, Weiss said that he and the Shaker Heights City Council considers the review process ""most critical in our ongoing efforts to align policies and practices with the goals and expectations of the police department which includes the fair and equal application of the law.""
The Mayor added: ""I can say with confidence that the Shaker Heights police officers look forward to working in partnership with residents on this important work. They are committed to living up to the high standards they have for themselves and that the community has for them."""
