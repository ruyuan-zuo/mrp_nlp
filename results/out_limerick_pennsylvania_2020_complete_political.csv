The Royersford Trestle Bridge project, which has been in the works for years, is one of 15 initiatives around Montgomery County to receive funding from the latest round of Montco 2040 Implementation Grants, which support sustainability countywide.
The borough will receive $115,000 to assist with the project, which will connect walkers, runners, and bikers on the Schuylkill River Trail to downtown Royersford. The bridge will also provide access to the waterfront trail.
Royersford has already received a $1 million multimodal grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development to support this project.
All told the county disbursed $2.25 million, with 15 out 27 applications receiving funding. Projects were evaluated by the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners based on several factors, including impact, consistency with local and county future plans, project readiness, and compatibility with sustainability goals which aim to make the county more walkable and bikeable.
The Montco 2040 program has awarded $7.5 million in grants to similar projects since the program was initiated in 2016."

Morroney, the lone Democrat on the board, said the board's other four members, all Republicans, were in direct defiance of an order from Gov. Wolf to wear masks or coverings during the May 12 meeting. He said there is a sign reminding visitors to the township building to do so.
""Why then, did my four fellow supervisors choose not to wear a mask during tonight's township supervisor's meeting? As we all know by now, wearing a mask protects your fellow citizens from you, in the event you are infected,"" Morroney wrote in a Facebook post. ""I chose to wear a mask during tonight's public meeting, and it wasn't a difficult choice! I wore a mask because I respect my fellow supervisors, the township employees and members of the public who were present, and because I am concerned for their health and safety.""
Supervisor Kara Schuler said that Morroney was allowing politics to get in the way of the board's work.
""Mr. Moroney's antagonistic trait continuously prevents the Board from moving forward and getting work done,"" she said. ""He always has us on the defense. I respectfully have no comment and I have no interest in furthering this argument with him.""
Chair Thomas Neafcy agreed with Schuler.
""Mr. Morroney has been a negative presence on this board almost from the beginning,"" he told Patch Monday. ""The board has tried to mentor him since his election but he continues to be a disruption as we work to maintain high levels of service for the community.""
Morroney added that all of the other township employees present for the meeting were wearing masks.
""As elected officials, we are supposed to lead by example,"" he wrote.
According to a report in the Pottstown Mercury, which first reported this case, Morroney said that Neafcy and Montgomery County Commissioner Joe Gale agreed to ""not enforce"" the closure of non-essential businesses.
Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh has repeatedly stated that enforcement of these closures will come, if at all, from the state level, as it is the state who has issued the closure orders."

The state legislature passed the bill, Senate Bill 613, 108 to 94 on Tuesday. It was opposed by all Democrats in the chamber, as well as a few Republicans.
>>>Stay up-to-date on coronavirus developments — sign up for Patch news alerts
As Montgomery County has a mostly Democratic delegation to the state house, most local representatives, including several in the Limerick area, voted against the bill.
The bill would allow certain businesses to reopen so long as they followed the health advisories laid out for businesses by the CDC and the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Specifically, Republicans are targeting the reopening of construction businesses, auto dealers, and real estate offices. They argue that these businesses are open in other states and that Gov. Wolf's shutdown order of nonessential businesses, in place since mid-March, is too restrictive.
""We have to fight the COVID-19 crisis, but we also have to prevent the collapse of Pennsylvania's economy,"" House Speaker Mike Turzai wrote in a social media statement earlier this week. ""(Gov. Wolf) should work with the legislature to allow citizens to return to safe working environments within the parameters of CDC and Homeland Security guidance so they can put food on the table.""
Democrats argue that now is not the time to lift measures, and that prematurely reopening the economy will prolong the crisis and lead to overwhelming the healthcare system.

And they've continued forward with a long-planned refueling project despite urging from local officials to postpone it until the virus is under control.
Local officials said they became aware of a refueling project, which would bring hundreds into the area, on March 16. Under normal circumstances, the anticipated spark in the local economy and boon to the area's hospitality's industry would be very welcome. But with the virus rapidly growing out of control, the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners asked to see Exelon's emergency response plan.
Stay up to date on developments — sign up for Patch news alerts.
They were not impressed.
""We concluded that the plan was not adequate for the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh said.
The Commissioners asked Exelon to to postpone the work, and they refused, launching the refueling project and promising they would increase safety precautions and practice social distancing.
However, according to information provided by the Montgomery County Department of Public Safety, social distancing has not been practiced at the plant.
""Thus far, Exelon has provided an inadequate pandemic response plan, withheld information from county and state officials, and failed to prioritize the safety of its employees, contract workers, community first responders, as well as all residents,"" State Sen. Katie Muth (D-44), wrote in part of a public letter to Exelon's leadership, calling for transparency and corporate responsibility from the energy giant.
Arkoosh noted Thursday that Exelon was also putting first responders, who would have to go to the plant in the case of an accident, at unncessary risk of exposure.
""Our community deserves to be treated better than this,"" she said in a press conference Thursday.
In an emailed statement sent to Patch, Exelon did not address the allegations from officials that social distancing had not been in place, but did defend their procedures that were in place as of Thursday.
""We have strict procedures in place to keep the public, our employees and contractors safe during the outage, and we will continue to host daily calls with our Montgomery and Chester County officials, answer questions and keep them informed,"" the statement reads, in part.
Exelon confirmed that two employees have tested positive for the virus. Both cases were confirmed before this project began, the company said.
Arkoosh said the company owes the public reassurances. Muth's letter addressed several other points where officials found the company's handling of the situation ""grossly irresponsible.""
For one, the company has not provided officials with a complete list of worker accommodations. First responders need to be geographically aware of where the increased risk of exposure is located, both for their own response and so they can help hospitality employees prepare and keep themselves safe, Muth said.
Exelon has, belatedly, begun to provide this information. As of Thursday afternoon, Montgomery County said they had received information back on 950 individuals. Arkoosh said they were staying all over the five-county area, in a wide variety of lodgings, from friends' homes and hotels to Airbnbs and campsites.
Muth's letter also asks for the company to work with the government to implement a 14-day controlled quarantine for all workers to limit the spread of the virus.
""I believe that they have an obligation not only to the families of these workers, but to the community they're going to next, to quarantine,"" Arkoosh said Thursday.
All workers should be paid by Exelon during the quarantine, officials said.
Finally, it demands that Exelon provide far greater transparency throughout the refueling process, specifically in how it is ensuring the safety of workers who show symptoms of coronavirus.
Exelon has launched a ""neighbor information webpage"" to explain their safety practices at Limerick here.
Montgomery County has already seen 10 deaths and nearly 600 cases of the virus, as of early Thursday.

Contact tracing for all three of the Montgomery County corrections officers has been completed, Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh said in a press conference Monday. None of the officers who had contact with the infected individuals is showing symptoms, but all are self-quarantining. They are awaiting test results to see if they have contracted the virus.
Officials are working to reduce prison populations both in the state system and at the county level. Arkoosh said that the daily number of new admissions to Montgomery County Correctional Facility has dropped from a previous average of 28, to just eight. Early parole, electronic monitoring, deferral of sentencing, and administrative penalties for nonviolent crimes are a few of the alternatives being explored.
The state prison system quarantine imposes strict restrictions on inmate movement, ordering meal delivery in cells and taking prisoners one by one out for phone calls or library access. Though Montgomery County Correctional Facility has not yet imposed that level of quarantine, they have suspended all visits and are screening all personnel who enter the facility.
Activists have been calling for drastic reductions in prison populations since the outbreak of the virus, citing inhumane conditions and the likelihood that the virus would spread very rapidly once it got inside the tight, densely populated quarters of a prison.

Borough of Spring City Council President Don Shaner called the funding and project a ""game changer."" He announced the borough was happy to be awarded funding through the Chester County Community Revitalization Program, specifically to help improve the parking lot at Yost Avenue and North Main Street.
""The grant will enable the borough to rehabilitate this lot and ensure it meets ADA requirements. This should help in alleviating some of the parking issues on Main Street and hopefully spur business growth in the future,"" said Shaner.
Shaner thanked Chester County Commissioners and their staff for issuing the award. He also thanked State Sen. Katie Muth (D-44th) and State Rep. Danielle Friel Otten (D-155th) for their letters of support in order to secure the grant.
Borough officials said they spent years to get to this point. Through the process, the borough had to negotiate with an owner originally unwilling to sell to the borough, spend nearly a year in the courts clearing the title to the property, and finally work for close to two years obtaining the funding to make the lot compliant with the American Disabilities Act.
Shaner said that while it has not been a simple process, Borough Council feels this will be a ""game changer"" for the downtown commercial district.
""Last but not least, Council would like to thank our Borough Manager, Dennis Rittenhouse, for his tireless efforts working on the grant proposal,"" said Shaner.

Friel Otten said, ""Congratulations. My office was glad to help."""

Oct. 7, 2020
The Senate unanimously approved a bill yesterday that would strengthen penalties for child pornography and create a new task force to prevent children from being victimized by this heinous crime, according to Sen. Bob Mensch (R-24) who supported the bill.
Senate Bill 1075 would increase penalties in all cases of child pornography in which the child is under the age of 10 or prepubescent. In these cases, the bill would increase the penalty for creating child pornography from a second-degree felony to a first-degree felony, with a maximum penalty of more than 10 years. A first offense for disseminating this sort of child pornography would also be increased from a third-degree felony to a second-degree felony.
Currently law only provides an increase in grading of the offense when the crime includes a depiction of indecent contact with a child. The bill would ensure that a broader range of child pornography offenders could face increased fines and prison sentences.
The legislation would also provide a sentence enhancement for offenses in which the child depicted is known to the offender.
In addition, the bill would create a special Task Force on Child Pornography to review all laws pertaining to child pornography and make recommendations to improve the investigation and prosecution of offenders. The task force will also be responsible for developing guidance and tools for sexual abuse prevention and suggesting any necessary changes to state law to help identify cases and hold offenders accountable for their crimes.
The bill was sent to the House of Representatives for consideration.
