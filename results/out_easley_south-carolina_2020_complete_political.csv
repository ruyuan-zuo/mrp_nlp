Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per week—or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data set—Iowa—and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

While I may not agree with the strategy of conservative Republicans in Washington, I support their aim – reducing federal government spending. They see and understand the negative effects of deficit spending. 
The US government (more specifically the US Treasury) has run a deficit 36 of the past 40 years and the deficits are getting larger at an alarming rate. Under President Clinton the worst annual deficit was $255 billion. Under President Bush, the worst deficit was $458 billion. Under Obama, the deficits have been over $1 trillion. Total US Treasury debt is now $16.9 trillion.
Whenever the US Treasury spends more than it brings it, it borrows the difference. Specifically the Treasury issues bonds, notes and bills and borrows more money to fund its deficit. 
Savings are limited or growing very slowly, so the growing appetite of the US Treasury for credit pushes up interest rates. In turn, rising interest rates slow economic growth, because higher rates make it more expensive to buy a new home or car and make it more costly to build a new factory or start a new business.
Our leaders in Washington realize higher interest rates are harmful to the economy, but they also realize they lack the will to cut spending, so the Federal Reserve Bank (the national bank) steps in to help by printing more money. Since 2009, the Federal Reserve has printed about $2.9 trillion in new money. That is, the last four years the Fed has printed more 3 times the amount of money it printed the first 95 years of its existence. 
When the Fed prints money, it creates a surplus of money in the financial system, so when the US Treasury steps up its borrowing, interest rates don't rise and they remain low. You can see the low interest rates are stimulating the economy and it is growing again.
The problem with all this money sloshing around in the system is it gets spent on everything else too. This causes the general level of prices to rise (inflation). Why a pack of 500 envelopes are $8.99 when they were $5.99 a few years ago. Why, when you ask the local clerk at the home supply store, she says they are getting some sort of price increase every week now. Ice cream still costs $4.99, but instead of getting a half gallon (2 quarts), the container is only 1.5 quarts. 
The government's official inflation gauge (CPI – Consumer Price Index) states inflation is only 1.5%, but like most economic measures, the CPI was made more rosy in the early 1990's.  Using the old CPI, inflation is truly running at about 6%. Put that together with the fact average household income is rising at 2%, we are all falling behind. Doing the math, the typical person's purchasing power is declining about 4% a year. This will continue, continuing to erode our standard of living.
Using the debt ceiling or by shutting down the government, the conservatives in the US House are trying to get to the root of the problem -- excessive federal spending. I would have gone about it differently, but I do agree with their aim. Federal spending and the resulting deficits must be reduced or we'll all wake up in 10 years and see we are living a lifestyle that is significantly below what it was just a few years ago.

I bring before you a ""crime"" case study before the citizens of Pickens County.

Characters: 18 year old female ""criminal""
                    Male police officer, magistrate judge

Setting:  Well lit downtown Pickens city

Time:  approximately 10 pm

Crime: Headlights not on due to inadvertently hitting dial for auto turn on while helping mother with moving some items.

Background of ""criminal"":  Graduated 2013 a National Honor Society with a 4.0, attends more than full time, local community college for Computer Engineering, worked 6 days a week at local restaurant all summer, now works one day a week at same place due to school. Actively been seeking work, and has even recently took a job sign waving for a local furniture store so she can survive.

As a side note, a certain retired professor, recently gave her a large amount of money for her college education, after meeting her at the local restaurant over the summer including a letter of accommodation.

Never been in the slightest trouble. No past criminal record of any kind.

She has volunteered for the local hospital, and serves as a volunteer our great State of SC in the State Guard under our Governor Nikki Haley, when she enlisted on her 17th birthday with parental consent. She attends every military training and is on call to serve at a moments notice.

Case plead by 18 year old before the magistrate:

You honor I admit I did not have my lights on, I made a mistake, an honest mistake. The only defense I have is my lights are suppose to come on automatically, and I must have inadvertently taken them off auto, I was on a well lit street and and just honestly hadn't noticed. I was in the wrong. I ask the court to take into consideration I made an honest mistake.

I would also like to say I have never been in any kind of trouble. I attend college where I have an ""A"" average. I do volunteer work here in the county, I'm in the SC Guard, and I worked for several candidates in the last election.

I work 1 day a week at Jimmy's Resturant, where I earn minimum wage, just enough to pay gas and car expense to school.

While I can't tell you you will never see me in here again, I can promise you I will never violate the law intentionally.

I made a mistake I'm asking for mercy. If you would like, maybe I could do some community service, but I honestly am not a trouble maker. I'm just trying the best I can to serve my community, get an education, and be a good citizen.

Thank you for hearing me out your honor.

Decision of magistrate: $155 and 2 points

Background: magistrate did not look at defendant, and after defendant was done speaking her case, asking for mercy, only stated while then looking up at her: ""$155 by December -- and if you don't pay your license will be suspended."" Have a nice day.

On the ticket itself it says you can pay the fine or go to court and see the judge. My advice and other well respected folks of the community encouraged her to plead for mercy from the court.

Is this what our system is about? How are judges, judges? We know don't we?

 The police officer could have given a stern warning or of course the ticket as he chose. The judge is there to hear the case and use wisdom to decide what is just and fair in the circumstances and then make judgement.

It is one thing to willfully break the law and another to mistakenly break the law- is it not? Have we gone so far as to not care about our citizens as "" people""- individuals, human beings?

I sat and watched our justice system...

This is the first experience of a young person who believes innocently and naively in a system we call Justice.

Signed,
Proud mother of the 18 year old young lady.

Michelle Wiles"

I read members of the local state delegation are considering adding a seventh seat to the school board, and they are seeking public input on the idea. I credit them for asking the public what it thinks before taking action. 
Some have said they fear of too many tie votes on the six member board.  That's an understandable concern, but the voting record doesn't justify that fear. The school board has cast hundreds of votes and only seven had 3 to 3 votes. Six of the seven of those votes were met with a compromise in that meeting or the meeting after, and the issue was resolved with a majority vote. For example, in the 2011-12 budget session, where significant spending cuts were made, three alternative plans were proposed that night. The first two plans failed 3 to 3, and the third passed 4 to 2 and the board passed its budget in short order.
Others have said Easley is under represented. This is untrue. The con­cept of one man/ one vote and equal representation is protected by the US Constitution, Constitutional case law and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Those laws are enforced by the US Justice Department and the state. If anyone was under-represented, the size of the voting districts would have never been approved, or the county would have been sued long ago. 
Those supporting this 7th seat have argued the Easley school attendance zone has only 1 representative on the school board (the Easley trustee) but the Pickens zone has 2 representatives (the Pickens and Dacusville trustees). Close inspection of the school board districts reveals this also not true.  
The reason for the push to add a 7th seat is political, in my opinion. The spending, tax and borrowing group that ran the school board for years (from Easley and Clemson), overdid it with the Greenville Plan and raising property taxes a record 40 mills, so they lost a few elections. To regain a majority on the board, they are trying to gain an advan­tage not by winning the next election, but asking the delegation to change the rules for the election.
 My hope is the members of the delegation will see it fit to stick with the current board configuration, and let the voters of Pickens County determine in the November 2014 election whether or not the next step of the school board remains conservative, moderates or swings back to the left.

After an initial estimate of $158 million to build new schools the old School Board brought a $197 million referendum to the voters. After the referendum was defeated by a 2 to 1 vote, the old School Board voted the Greenville plan to borrow $315 million. For two years the building plan got nowhere because of incompetence. The old School Board had to borrow money to make payroll. The old Board laid off teachers. The old School Board has left you with a debt of approximately $11,600 on each home in Pickens County.
The new board now has 3 conservatives out of 6 seats. This new Board has reduced the number of administrative people, choosing instead to return teachers to the classroom. There will be NO tax increase from the School District, again.
The people who want another member on the school board want to spend more of your tax money and raise your taxes.  They claim Easley does not have its proper representation on the school board.  That is false.  The school board districts are the same as the County Council districts.  Each district by law has the same number of people.
We do not need another seat on the School Board!  If we get another district on the school board the OLD school board will be back spending money without limit.

On September 9, 2013, Greene, Finney and Horton, LLP, the City's external auditors presented their summary of the audit for the 2013 financial statements.

As you may know, all city and county governments in South Carolina must be audited annually by an independent, qualified, third party. This provides a reasonable assurance to the Council and citizens of Pickens of the City's current financial status.

As the Mayor of our great city, I wanted to share some of the highlights and take a moment to thank our current City Council, Finance Director, City Administrator, and staff for all of their hard work this year which resulted in a clean audit with the best opinion a city can be given by its auditors – an ""Unmodified Opinion"".

We all work as a team daily to ensure we get a healthy financial report each year while delivering quality services to the citizens of Pickens. To read the full audit and supporting documents, please go to www.cityofpickens.com. Overall and City wide, the City had total capital asset additions of $3.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2013.

As of April 30, 2013, some of the significant projects were started or completed during 2013 were as follows: $2.29M in water plant and system upgrades; $166k in new water lines on Boggs Road and $140k in sewer system upgrades (once complete in 2013-2014 we will have spent well over $500k combined for these two projects); $301k in construction at the amphitheater as of April 30th; $249k at the Senior Center (this includes a parking lot upgrade); $170k in new fire equipment (fire department was very successful with a number of grants this year for capital equipment). Last year, the City was awarded approximately $1.2 million in grant funds—which went towards some of these projects and you will see more grants next year to offset costs for citizens. There was also approximately $500k in progress at April 30, 2013 – so the improvements continue! What you can expect to see on this list next year is the completion of more sewer lines totaling approximately $300k, sidewalk replacement and additions of approximately $200,000, and the completion of the Boggs Road line which will total over $200k. If you are interested in what water and sewer projects are coming up, you can see our 5 Year Capital Improvement Plan in the back of the City Budget at www.cityofpickens.com. Every department contributes to this plan and it's a guide for future purchases and investments that need to be planned for and carefully budgeted. On the general operations side of the City, we have a savings (or emergency fund) officially called ""unassigned fund balance"" that is extremely healthy at $1.3M or 44% of expenditures. To give you a better understanding of this number in context, Pickens County had a 60% fund balance at the end of their last audit in 2012. So our 44% unassigned fund balance is healthy, but it is not uncommon or ""too much"". City Council has a written policy on how much we will keep as a balance and this helps ensure we live within our means year to year during the budget process. This demonstrates that this Council and administration is making sure to save money and keep the City protected in the case of an emergency, while still funding ongoing operations and working on new capital investments. The reason it's important to have a healthy fund balance is to help with cash flow throughout the year, be prepared for unexpected emergency expenditures or shortfalls in revenue, potential for better interest rate on debt issues which saves the City money, and even more important because we are still living in uncertain economic times. Other highlights in our yearend financial audit was that due to the large number of grants we were awarded in this past fiscal year ($1.2 Million!), we created a new separate fund to account for the money and ensure its properly spent. In addition, a Hospitality Tax Fund was created to make it easier for citizens and Council to see where hospitality tax funds were being spent. Hospitality Tax is a 2% tax on prepared food and beverages which is in almost every city and county in the state. These funds are restricted by state law on what it can be used for and it must be tourism related. This past year, we used these funds towards ongoing payments on our recreation center which hosts many regional tournaments, our new amphitheater and its events, the beginning of the Pickens Doodle Line purchase, and Town Creek Bike Park. These funds can also be used for ongoing maintenance of these facilities and the events we host in downtown Pickens. In conclusion, another great year full of new water and sewer improvements, and as of April 30th the amphitheater, Doodle purchase and Town Creek Bike Park were well under way with the first two completed at the time of this letter. This current 2013-2014 year will be another year of progress for the City and we will continue to improve all of the City's core infrastructure while pushing forward on tourism related projects that will help bring people to our City and our downtown businesses and restaurants. We are proud to have been able to keep our City fire department for our citizens to ensure they continue to have quality fire protection with a low ISO rating that is under the direction of the City Council. We are also excited that Pickens County is adding three additional fire stations in close proximity to City which will benefit everyone as we continue to work together and enjoy a great partnership. Each year we look for ways to operate more efficiently and find ways to use technology to work smarter. We are taking a hard look at the way things ""have always been done"" to make sure it's still the most cost effective and quality way to deliver services to our businesses and citizens.

He spoke on the subject at a recent Pickens Chamber of Commerce luncheon.
Martin said he knows firsthand about the rising cost of college and the burden it puts on parents and students.
""I've been paying college tuition since 2004,"" Martin said. ""I've got three more semesters to go. We've been very, very fortunate to have put some money aside, to drive a car as long (as you can), the different kind of things that you do so you can pay that tuition. But guess what? There's a lot of kids out there that don't have that, and won't graduate from Clemson, won't graduate from Carolina, with less than $50,000 or $70,000 in debt.""
That debt burden will follow students as they get that first post-college job and beyond, Martin said.
""They start having to pay $300, $400, $500 a month on a student loan,"" he said. ""How are they going to buy a house? How are they going to do much of anything for awhile? That retards your economic growth because they're not spending money and keeping the homebuilders and various parts of our economy moving – they're mired in student debt.
""It's not just South Carolina,"" Martin said. ""This is happening all across the country.""
One chamber member said he believed colleges and universities often ""push debt onto students … without a lot of thought behind it.""
Martin said one of his children had a roommate from North Carolina who was forced to return to her home state because out-of-state tuition costs were simply too high.
""She came down here for one year and went back to North Carolina,"" he said. ""We've got to have an educated workforce. Whether it's a technical college, career-type graduate or a college graduate, it's going to take one or the other going forward – there are going to be very few jobs for just a plain high school graduate. The point is, how costly do we want that to be for our young people? Because the average folks out here just don't save that kind of money to pay (for college.) We're talking mega-bucks , relatively speaking. It's going to really harm economic growth if we don't do something about it."""

The center is currently closed and could remain so if a way forward isn't found.
Steve Crowe spoke to Easley City Council members Monday night on behalf of Seniors Unlimited.
""We're in a financial mess, to be very blunt,"" Crowe said. ""We had to close the Easley Center because of unsafe conditions. It rains about as much on the inside as it does on the outside.""
Part of the rainwater runs through the building's breaker panel, he said.
""That's enough to close the building (right there),"" Crowe said. ""Part of the ceiling has collapsed. Mold is growing inside the building. We don't have the funds to fix the building. We have no money to repair the building. There's just not enough funds to keep everything maintained.""
The Easley center is located at 401 Blair Street, the former Alice Elementary School site.
The building's five air conditioner units were stolen shortly after they closed the building, Crowe said.
""We serve meals to the seniors of Easley,"" Crowe said.
Currently, Easley seniors wishing to take part in Seniors Unlimited meals and programs are being transported to the Liberty Center.
But that building is currently under foreclosure, Crowe said.
""We're trying to work something out there,"" he said. ""That's the kind of financial problems that we're having. We would like for see city council to consider doing something to help keep our facility open in Easley.""
At one time, Pickens County Seniors Unlimited had centers in Easley, Pickens, Liberty and Central. It sold the Pickens location, which is now operated as the Pickens Senior Center.
""They're doing great work up there for the seniors,"" Crowe said.
""When we leave, Easley will have nothing for the seniors, that I'm aware of, besides Seniors Unlimited,"" he said.
Some of the seniors served by the Easley center have written letters detailing what the center and its programs mean to them.
Many of their clients are living alone on fixed incomes and have no transportation.
""Without Seniors Unlimited, I would be homebound, depending on a neighbor to take me to the grocery store,"" Crowe said.
The Easley center delivers 48 home-delivered meals and 20 congregant meals, Crowe said.
""They have exercise, line dancing, several classes that they have, they play pool and bingo, they work on puzzles"" he said.
He spokes of one senior who had learned to quilt at the center.
The center serves about 30 seniors a day on average, Crowe said.
""We serve about 117 unduplicated clients at the Easley center and another 52 at the Central center,"" he said. ""An unduplicated client – if we do five meals a week –, that's only one person, that's one unduplicated person. That 117, that's at least five times that much.""
The Easley center delivers meals to 82 unduplicated clients in Easley.
""They go to the center to work on puzzles, to exercise and socialize,"" Crowe said. ""For some of them, that's the only place they go. Without us delivering the meals or picking them up and taking them to the center, some of them – we've got story on top of story about how they don't have any food. We need some help from somewhere.""
One way the city could help is with the building's repairs. Another way is suggesting ways to significantly increase the center's revenue.
Crowe said SU officials have no problems with locating in Liberty, but that the Easley facility has three times as many seniors as the other two.
""Easley is by far the biggest facility we have,"" Crowe said.
Easley's seniors can't afford to drive to the Central center and back for a meal.
He wondered if there was any property in Easley that could be used rent-free for the operation of the senior center.
Mayor Larry Bagwell said he didn't know if the former Simpson Academy site, now the home of the Dream Center of Pickens County, had extra space the center could use.
But he said the issue was very important to both himself and council members. He's asked the city's grant writer to look into opportunities for the center.
""We will be looking into the situation and try to come up with something,"" Bagwell said. ""I pledge that we will be looking at helping you somehow."""

Projects Manager
Opponents of same-gender civil marriage shriek bitterly about divorced couples, broken families, and orphaned children, and claim — incorrectly — that all these problems will worsen if same-gender couples get married.
That's untrue.
In fact, with marriage equality already adopted in 14 American states and 18 nations, we now have proof that these problems improve in every jurisdiction where same-gender couples can marry.
Many divorces occur after a gay or lesbian spouse realizes that they never should have married into a mixed-gender marriage in the first place.  Same-gender civil marriage virtually eliminates this problem.
Opponents of same-gender civil marriage complain that same-gender couples ""steal"" the children of mixed-gender couples.  But there's no such thing, no same-gender couple ever stole any competent mixed-gender couple's child, and no government agency would ever allow that.  Same-gender civil marriage never increases the rate of ""baby theft.""
Opponents threaten endlessly that civil marriage will just make more orphans.  That's false.  Many children end up being fostered or adopted precisely because their mixed-gender parents abandon them in the first place, and then it is a same-gender couple that finally returns them into a loving home.  Same-gender civil marriage doesn't increase the number of children who have no loving parents, it reduces it.
Opponents of same-gender civil marriage complain tearfully that ""children are secondary"" and that ""adults lose sight of the children.""  Yes, many mixed-gender couples do treat their children as secondary, and many mixed-gender couples do lose sight of their own offspring.  But it is precisely because most children born to mixed-gender couples are unplanned, unexpected, and unwanted that there are so many children in need of a new, loving pair of parents to raise them.  Same-gender couples are the solution to this problem, not the cause of it.
Over the last 60 years, the parenting track record of mixed-gender couples has steadily worsened, and it shows no signs of improving.  This is not the fault of any same-gender couple.  But it is same-gender couples who often provide loving homes to the unplanned, unexpected, unwanted children who get abandoned by their own, biological, mixed-gender parents who can't or won't care for them.
In 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau counted 646,464 same-gender couples nationwide.  Allowing all such couples to legally marry and care for each other – and then allowing many of those couples to raise otherwise orphaned children – will benefit the adults, the children, and all of society."
17,/south-carolina/easley/clemson-president-urges-congress-to-close-innovation-deficit,2013-08-11T18:00:13Z,Clemson President Urges Congress to Close ...,0,0,Jason Evans,Patch Staff,"Clemson University President James F. Barker and 164 other university presidents and chancellors called on leaders in Washington to increase investment in research and education and close the ""innovation deficit.""
In an open letter to President Barack Obama and Congress, the presidents and chancellors wrote that closing the widening gap between needed and actual investments in research and education — the innovation deficit — is a national imperative. Investments in research and education lead to innovation and new technologies that power the nation's economy, create jobs, and reduce the budget deficit while ensuring the U.S. maintains its role as global leader, they said.
""Throughout our history, this nation has kept the promise of a better tomorrow to each generation,"" the letter stated. ""Failing to deal with the innovation deficit will pass to future generations the burdens of lost leadership in innovation, economic decline, and limited job opportunities. We call upon you to reject unsound budget cuts and recommit to strong and sustained investments in research and education.""
Economists agree that more than half of U.S. economic growth since World War II is a consequence of technological innovation, much of which results from federally funded scientific research conducted at U.S. universities. Such groundbreaking research, the university leaders noted, has led to lifesaving vaccines, lasers, MRI, touchscreens, GPS, the Internet and many other advances that have improved lives and generated entire new sectors of the economy.
China, Singapore and South Korea have dramatically increased their investments in research and higher education over the past two decades after observing how those kinds of investments have benefited the U.S. economy, the letter stated. They have had two to four times the U.S. rate of growth in research and development investment during that period. 
Following Congress' failure to reach a larger budget deal to replace the Budget and Control Act of 2011, the federal government has plans to enact $85 billion in automatic spending reductions. These spending cuts are expected to continue over the next 10 years, totaling approximately $1.2 trillion in cuts in federal expenditures, which would have a dramatic impact on Clemson University and the economic development of South Carolina.
""I recognize the importance of shared sacrifice, but it's time for a strategic rather than an automatic approach to spending cuts,"" Barker said. ""Understanding that future cuts are coming and that Clemson needs to continue to find funding in a severely constrained budget, I urge our congressional leaders to pursue a larger budget deal to replace these cuts and ensure long-term solutions to our nation's federal deficit concerns, including tax and entitlement reform.""
The 165 universities represented in the letter are members of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities and/or the Association of American Universities. Clemson is a member of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities.

That was one of the messages Sen. Larry Martin delivered to Pickens Chamber of Commerce members at a luncheon Thursday.
""We do need to throttle back the rain,"" he said. ""We finally got a little bit of money dedicated to roads and bridges and we're going to use it up replacing what's getting washed out.""
Two bridges in the Central area were damaged by flash flooding caused by heavy rains earlier this week.
Earlier this summer, a portion of Highway 178 near the North Carolina border was washed out.
""There's not telling what this deal on 178 is going to cost,"" Martin said. ""You're not going to believe how close it is to the state line. Why couldn't it happen (on the other side)?
""Those are the kind of things you have to deal with,"" he said. ""Most people look at the state and they go, 'Well, they have insurance, you carry insurance to cover that type of thing.' The state doesn't have insurance to cover those types of catastrophes. You just have to grin and bear it.""
Martin asked Chamber members if they'd driven in North Carolina or Georgia recently.
""Did you notice much difference in the quality of the roads?"" he asked. ""They actually spend more money on their roads than we do. It's very obvious. North Carolina's gasoline tax is double ours.
""We've got to do something about our roads,"" Martin said. ""You're not going to fix roads with political rhetoric. You're not going to fix roads with a lot of hot air and a bunch of politicians bloviating over what they could do differently.""
Martin has been driving to Dacusville often recently and has seen the condition of Highway 186 personally
""That road is so rough that if you drive more than 45mph … you will likely wind up in a ditch,"" he said. ""That's what we call a primary road in this state … and there is no hope – I can tell you because I checked – there is no hope of that road being repaved any time soon. That's ridiculous.""
Carroll Campbell was governor the last time the state addressed its roads in any substantive way, Martin said.
Labor costs and construction materials are much more expensive these days, Martin said.
""You just can't build roads and fix bridges on the same budget you had back then,"" he said. ""It just doesn't add up.""
Martin said there's no appetite in Columbia to raise the gasoline tax.
""And I get that,"" he said. ""I understand that.""
This year, legislators approved a nearly-$600 million infrastructure package, which includes $50 million in recurring funds allocated to the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) to be bonded for $500 million; moving half of the sales tax on automobiles to the Highway Fund on a recurring basis, generating about $41 million annually; and, $50 million in one time funds to be used for bridge repair.
""And that's going to help, but it's just a drop in the bucket,"" Martin said. ""It's just a drop in the bucket and I would be doing you a disservice if I stood up here and said we could keep taking money out of the general fund budget and giving it to roads and bridges.""
One legislator had proposed cutting the general fund budget by 10 percent, which Martin says would severely hurt not only roads and bridges repairs and maintenance, but mental health, the state's higher education system and more.
""To stand there and suggest we can cut $600 million with no pain, no problems, out of the general fund is crazy,"" Martin said. ""You might as well tell me I'm going to the moon and back today.""
The problem needs more funding and attention from the state, Martin said, adding he knows you can't just throw money at a problem.
""It's going to take some serious, thoughtful consideration as to how we deal with it,"" he said.
Attendees suggested adjusting the sales tax cap on vehicles, taxing smaller utility trailers and raising the taxes on mopeds as ways of raising infrastructure funds.
He has advocated increasing the state's gas tax by five cents – a move that would provide more infrastructure funding while allowing South Carolina's gasoline tax to remain one of the lowest in the country.
""We can't be responsible stewards of the public purse and keep doing what we've been doing for the last 10-15 and expect a different result,"" Martin said. ""We've got to do what's necessary to keep this state going or it's going to hurt economic development, it's going to hurt our ability to not only attract folks to South Carolina, but keeping our young folks. We don't need to lose our best talent that we've worked so hard … to try and keep here.""
He said efforts to recruit business and industry such as BMW and Boeing to the state had paid off, but all that work could be wasted if the state does not address its crumbling infrastructure.
But with an election year next year, Martin said he didn't much change of substantive change occurring.
""They're too interesting in running in the next election,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, we've got to do what's best for the state. It might be a hard pill to swallow from a standpoint political standpoint. I've reach the point where I'm not all that worried about the next election. Am I going to do what I think the voters want me to do? Of course. But I'm also going to do what I think is right for this state."""
19,/south-carolina/easley/lifesaving-birth-defects-bill-becomes-law,2013-08-09T03:00:10Z,Lifesaving Birth Defects Bill Becomes Law,0,0,Jason Evans,Patch Staff,"Bill, named after Clemson child born with congential heart defect, requires birthing facilities to give every newborn child a pulse oximetry test.
A bill designed to help facilities detect problems with the lungs and hearts of newborns that ultrasounds may miss has been signed into law.
Governor Nikki Haley joined with Senator Alexander, representatives from the American Heart Association, and Emerson Rose's parents, Jason and Susan Smith of Clemson, Wednesday in a ceremonial bill signing for S.341, the Emerson Rose bill. S.341 requires birthing facilities in South Carolina to perform a pulse oximetry test on every newborn child between 24 and 48 hours of life.
Sen. Larry Martin, R-Pickens, was a co-sponsor of the bill.
He said the inexpensive test uses cord blood to make sure the newborn's lungs and heart are healthy. 
""It's a simple test, and from that simple test, it can detect a heart defect you would otherwise not know about in an infant,"" Martin said. ""Upon birth, they would do just a minor blood test with the cord blood. Very easy to do, but it can really save an infant's life, if they know that the defect exists. Otherwise you don't know until the baby dies. That's just one of the things that came out of the unfortunate, unexpected death of an otherwise healthy baby.""
Emerson Rose Smith was born with a congenital heart defect and passed away only 76 days after she was born.
Susan and Jason Smith vowed raise awareness and money to fight congenital heart defects and established the Emerson Rose Heart Foundation, in memory of their daughter.
""They're a wonderful couple,"" Martin said. ""They had researched this. Some other states had done it, and they wanted to do this in memory of their child who died. I thought it was a wonderful idea.""
""While I am blessed to be a governor, I am also blessed to be a mom and this bill pulls on my heart,"" said Gov. Nikki Haley. ""Due to Jason and Susan Smith's dedication to making a difference and the action we are taking today, Emerson Rose's name is going to live on and positively influence the health of babies across the state.""
Performing a pulse oximetry test can give caregivers insight into the lungs and heart of newborns and head-off complications not detected by ultrasound.
The Emerson Rose bill continues Gov. Haley's commitment to keeping South Carolina's babies healthy – from improved access to care for expecting mothers, to reducing elective pre-term deliveries, to ensuring that expecting mothers with drug or alcohol problems get the treatment they need.
The bill unanimously passed the House and Senate."
