Nationally, employment rose by 199,000 jobs in December, and the unemployment rate dropped by 0.3 percentage points to 3.9 percent when seasonally adjusted, according to the BLS. The total number of jobs added was the lowest of any month in 2021; however, the BLS tends to revise job estimate figures upward in subsequent months.
The national unemployment rate dropped by 2.8 percentage points over the course of 2021 and continued to move closer to the pre-pandemic rate of 3.5 percent.
The latest available local unemployment figures are for November; that rate improved since October in the Fridley area and continues to be lower than it was after the pandemic first struck.
The Anoka County unemployment rate was 2.2 percent in November, down from 2.5 percent in October. That reflected some improvement from November 2020, when the unemployment rate stood at 4.4 percent.
The November unemployment rate in Anoka County was the same rate as Minnesota, according to the latest figures from the BLS.
Nationally, average hourly earnings increased by 19 cents per hour from November to December, up to $31.31, according to the BLS. Average hourly earnings increased 4.7 percent in 2021.
Some experts predict January and possibly February hiring will slow down due to the omicron coronavirus variant, according to The New York Times.
The leisure/hospitality industry continued to add jobs, with a net gain of 53,000 positions in December. Still, employment in the industry is down by 1.2 million positions, or 7.2 percent, since February 2020.
The BLS also revised previous national monthly employment figures upwards; October's total job growth was revised by 102,000 positions, for a total growth of 648,000. November's job growth went up an additional 39,000 positions to a total of 249,000.

In my commentary at the June 9th Anoka County board meeting, (minute 3:50) in the wake of the horrific death of George Floyd I encourage us all to get uncomfortable. Because having honest conversations about race and racism is uncomfortable. And I would like to start with myself.
Since that board meeting, I've gotten feedback and criticisms from others about my identification as a person of color. I want to be clear that I do not begrudge this kind of questioning. I welcome it. Because like it or not, race and identity today has become a two-way street, where what one personally identifies with, may or may not be what the outside world agrees with. Throw in that I am now an elected official with certain expectations placed on me, I fully accept that I have stepped into the arena.
I want to talk about my own lifetime struggle of trying to reconcile my racial identity for as long as I can remember—personally—in hopes we can talk about it publicly.
When it comes to racial identity, I have never had a solid place to land. Instead, I have always hovered in-between. I was born in Seoul, Korea and came home to Minnesota as a malnourished infant at the age of thirteen months to a loving and good white family, in a good small Midwestern town. I grew up in a predominately white community and therefore had a very white American experience. With that came a lot of white privilege: access to good schools, music lessons and family vacations that included hotels with a pool.
However, I could not entirely divorce myself from my outwardly Asian self, nor did I want to. Growing up I was always reminded by others that I looked different, being referred to as ""chink"" and ""gook"" by classmates and (adult) strangers alike. Although I carried a white name (Mandy Wolf then Mandy Meisner), as an adult when I was no longer associated with my white family nor lived in a predominately white community, I experienced racism more often. In shopping malls. In restaurants. Among certain religious groups. Because of the way I looked.
I have always been consistent that I am who I am because of my experiences. I have experienced a very ""All-American"" life and I have a lot of whiteness in me. It's who I am. I am also Korean with a history and culture that runs through my blood and my DNA that constantly whispers in my ear. This is also who I am.
Minnesota has the largest Korean adoptee population in the nation. We need to make a safe space for adoptees to identify as both, or whatever their preference is. Because the idea of other people determining how I should identify—while I understand it—is hurtful and frustrating. Are my experiences with racism invalid because I'm adopted? Or is it that I haven't experienced enough racism and hardships to count as legitimate? Who gets to decide if not ourselves?
I will tell you when it comes to race and systemic racism, I am not overly concerned about how others may critique my racial identity. I know who I am.
What I am concerned about is that it took until 2018 to elect the first non-white Anoka County Commissioner, and I question why there are very few people of color who hold high level staff positions in a county that employs approximately 2,000 people.
This is what systemic racism looks like.
These are the issues I am committed to examine and change as a County Commissioner. And I'm not alone. I am part of Anoka County's Diversity and Inclusion Committee; a group dedicated to create a safe place for all voices to be heard and empower others in leadership.
My experience with racism is not about me. It's about all those who came before—and will come after me. It's about identifying inequities and how we are complicit in our history and the systems we have in place.
I hope you will join me to re-shape what is, to what should be.

When I was elected and realized what I was about to embark on, I grew weary before I had even begun. Becoming a first-time elected official overnight was a strange blend of great privilege and crushing responsibility. My drive to serve well and fear of failure weighed on my shoulders like slabs of granite.
Naturally, one of the most common questions I get asked is ""Do you like being in politics?"" - - to which I usually give a tidy answer: It's a challenge, but yes I do. The long answer is: I liken it to parenthood. You can theorize and observe in others what it might be like and how you might act as a parent, but all of it goes out the window once you become a parent and you live it to see how complicated and hard it really is to do well!
Politics is about influence. The strength of your influence is driven by the strength of your relationships. I have a lot of influence and there are also a lot of people who want to influence me. It can be easy to get lost in it. I believe it's my job to be thoughtful, smart and consistent about the decisions I make, and not let the pulls of influence—on either end—steer me off course. I must always know where true north is.
My first year in office as a County Commissioner has been intense, immensely challenging and incredibly rewarding. I am grateful for every hard situation because it has made me grow as a leader and most importantly, I have become a better advocate for others.
Q1: What has surprised you the most?
A1: There are a few things that have surprised me. I didn't fully appreciate how the County Board works. We work as a body. It is only as a collective Board that change can happen. Having consensus is what matters and shapes policies. And one of the most surprising things I learned is that we don't allow public commentary at our regular board meetings. My first action in 2020 was to propose an amendment to allow a maximum of ten minutes (two minutes per person) at our regular Board meetings*. We work for the public. The public should have a voice. The amendment failed in a 4-2 vote, but I will continue to advocate for this issue.
Q2: What was the hardest vote you had to take?
A2: After two months in office, the issue of Anoka County's lack of best-practices in hiring top staff positions came before me. The Board was asked to directly appoint our own Board Chair, another Commissioner, to our highest staff position as the next County Administrator. This meant the job would not be posted or any interviews conducted. The expectation was that directly appointing her as Administrator would be a good decision, and she had a lot of support from the Board to make this happen.
But I could not in good conscience support this action. While our Board Chair had a lot of experience as an elected official, she did not have an education or experience as an Administrator. Yet, because she was in a position of power, several Board members presumed that she could change her role from Commissioner to Administrator and oversee 2,000 county employees without interviewing her (or anyone else), or without having the appropriate credentials. It was not a best-practice hiring method for a public organization, and in my view, it was unethical in nature. When any decision is before me, I ask, who is benefiting the most from the outcome? The answer should always be the public **.

Q3: What's a fun Commissioner fact people might not know about?
A3: I am a rather short person (I'm 5'2"" if I stand very straight). I hate when I sit in a chair and my feet dangle because they don't touch the ground. In my first Board meeting, I did what I always do and lowered my chair so my feet would touch the floor. Apparently, this didn't give a good visual because you could hardly see me over the dais. The facilities department was kind enough to make me a box to place on the floor next to my chair so I could rest my feet on something solid and keep my chair at the highest elevation.
Q4: What have you done in your first year?
A4: Mostly, I spent my first year dedicated to learning how county government operates. I regularly attended committee meetings I was not assigned to. I plan to continue this practice in key areas like Transportation and Management.
I have a lot of energy for community service. I've looked for opportunities to better my district and I've found them! Here's a few things I've done in my first year in office:
Q 5: What do you hope to do in your second year?
A5: This is what I am very passionate about—possibilities! County government may run at a slow pace, but as a Commissioner, I have the privilege to make improvements for my district and the county at-large in meaningful ways.
Some future projects that I am excited about include the work of our Diversity & Inclusion Committee. As the first person of color on the Board representing the most diverse district in the county, I am committed to addressing the barriers people face in minority groups.
And who knows what other opportunities may present themselves..? I'm just getting started.

The general public can easily get behind a Presidential election. It's glamorous, with all the political drama and intrigue to capture a nation. I get it. It's easy to think that all the gloss will eventually come our way to make our lives better. But I am here to tell you, as an elected official in local government, it is our local seats that most affect your life. And if you don't vote in a Special Election, someone could be in leadership you're not happy with.
Local government is about your own backyard. While the state mandates many of the services counties must administer, it is your county board that sets the certified levy on property taxes and shapes staff culture. In Anoka County, that is a $300M annual budget with 2,000 employees. We are one of the biggest employers in the region and one of the areas we directly influence is our staff: hiring practices, pay grades and training.
The board may steer the county, but it is the staff who run it and work directly with community. Your tax dollars go to the systems and services to help our friends and neighbors get food, get jobs, have natural spaces, protect historic sites and artifacts, create meaningful library services—the list is lengthy and important things to govern.
In my 10 months in office, what I have concluded is the most import thing is not the long list of services—those have been and will continue to be addressed no matter who is in office. As I observe others and myself, the single most import factor in an elected official is this: How they will lead. What are the drivers behind their actions? And who do the actions benefit most?
Politics is about relationships and power and strategy. Each individual must decide how to develop and use them. I'm an idealist by nature and I protect my ideals. I grow diverse and strong networks to both learn about and execute my work. And I believe in representing others rather than imposing my will on them.
I got into politics to be the contrarian when the status quo works better for the elected leaders than for the people. I work hard to know where true north is—and I work even harder to stay the course. I strive to be aware of my biases and weaknesses and am also willing to be the lone voice to promote open and clean government when needed.
For me, this is the best way to honor the trust my district has given me. For others, it might be something different.
Leadership style matters. And I would argue this is the single most important factor when choosing your local officials. The ethics, examination, and independent will of the people you vote into office will shape your community. And you have the power to create what that looks like.
You need only to show up.
Special Elections historically have a low voter turnout rate. They occur when a vacancy in office opens due to death, resignation, or if the elected official is no longer eligible to serve.

In Anoka County, the County Commissioner seat in District 6 became open after our former Board Chair, Commissioner Rhonda Sivarajah, was appointed as our next County Administrator in a 4-2 vote on May 14th, 2019 (minute 58:25). Residents of Blaine (parts of Blaine), Centerville, Circle Pines, Columbus, Lexington, Lino Lakes and Linwood Township will have a chance to vote for their next County Commissioner in less than a month.
Six candidates have filed. The Special Primary will be held Tues. November 5th. The top two candidates will then go on to the general election held on Tues. February 11th.
Both election dates have early voting options. You can mail in an absentee ballot or vote in-person at your local City Hall, or the Anoka County Government Center. Early voting for the Special Primary is September 20th- November 4th. Details can be found HERE.

The sky was a smear of grey, colorful umbrellas dotted the steps as hundreds of people made their way into the Minnesota State Capital. I was among the crowd, making my way out of the drizzle, my teen aged daughter alongside me.
We were there to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing American women the right to vote. Past and present women elected officials from all levels of government were gathered to commemorate the day with a group photo.
Many prominent speakers shared their bit of the past, bringing us back to a time when women had no voice in shaping our legislation. They worked tirelessly against the grain for themselves and for their daughters, paving the way so that I and every other female elected official had a place to stand in history.
But there is more work to be done.
Women were first elected to the Minnesota Legislature in 1922. It wasn't until 1977 that women started to gain some momentum and has been steadily growing in representation—but not fast enough. In 2019 there are 48 women in the Minnesota House (35%) and 16 in the Senate (24%). *
Women Mayors in US cities with populations over 30,000 are at just 20%, with only 11 Mayors in the state of Minnesota being women.**
In county government, I could not find any statistics for women County Commissioners. None. I am the first woman in the seat for Anoka County's District 4, but the first women Commissioners in the county came on board in the 1980's. They were Natalie Haas Steffen and Margaret Langfeld. Margaret would later become the first woman chair of the Anoka County Board.
Statistically, women are asked 7-10 times to run for office before they say yes. This is true in my case as well. I had been asked multiple times over the years and had always said no.
Even when I was leaning to run for County Commissioner, I spent a lot of time meeting with other women in politics, asking questions before I committed. My worries: Could I do a good job? With no political background, was I qualified? These are typical concerns for women that can become self-induced barriers. Throw in the cultural expectations of family and work, and it can feel like an impossible feat better left to someone else. Maybe someone ""more qualified"".
I challenge us to examine what are good skills to hold office. Unfortunately, I think politics has shifted into a career-profession mindset rather than a public servant role. If we lead more with the public servant mentality, we might find more women inspired to run for office.
Why? Because women are already doing the work in public service. My years in community work of many types showed me that women are often the drivers in humanitarian and policy efforts. I've worked on countless projects to bring awareness, collaboration and funding to make change in our own backyard—and usually the teams are predominantly women.
Women have led—and continue to lead— the way in improvements to education, civic engagement and economic disparities. We may call it something else: PTA, Women of Today, and Philanthropy, but I assure you: this is the work we do, and it matters.
I encourage us to change a common narrative for women interested in politics. Instead of questioning if you have valuable skills to run for office, know you have valuable skills. Understand that your unique experience and perspective is what benefits our society and you deserve a seat at the table because of this.
If we made this shift in thinking—just imagine what the next 100 years might look like for women in politics.

Recently, I read an article about Presidential Candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar, working Iowa. It was a story about an underdog, trailing behind her colleagues in a crowded race vying for the DFL endorsement in 2020. Described as a hard-working, established politician, she is also plagued by a distinct criticism: she is a centrist.
I feel you, Amy.
Before I got into politics, I wasn't particularly political. I wasn't active much in my Senate District, I didn't organize political rallies at the State Capitol—heck, I hadn't ever had a candidate lawn sign on my property until I ran. Other than being an informed voter, playing at politics wasn't something I was interested in.
Don't misunderstand me. I have always had my political views and beliefs and show my support. But my values dictate my politics, my politics do not dictate my values. My world view includes building equity for everyone, embracing diversity, and working towards future change rather than preserving the past. I am unquestionably a Democrat.
And I never thought in a million years my personal politics would be a defining factor of who I am to the outside world. It shouldn't be. My actions should.
The city and county levels of local government are non-partisan seats. It was one of the appeals for me to run for County Commissioner and something I took to heart. In my numerous years of community service, I never asked for or gave help based on political affiliation of the people I worked with. Republicans and Democrats alike cared about community projects and got involved because community service is non-partisan.
Party politics shouldn't be the priority in non-partisan spaces. People should.
I thought that was a given, but I quickly learned how hard it is to put into practice when running for office. I found the biggest challenge wasn't the long hours, the perpetual scrutiny, or even the constant barrage of negative comments. The biggest challenge for me was to run a campaign that reflected who I really was and what my values are. I wanted voters to know how I was going to lead if elected, therefore I was committed to being authentic from Day One.
During my race, I was vocal about not having a party endorsement and fought for that. I believed voters deserved a non-partisan race for a non-partisan seat. When I asked for support, I asked from those I trusted and respected. My trust and respect were given based on shared ideals and demonstrated actions—not political agendas—I wasn't about to change that.
While I considered all this a strength, I was shocked that many others defined it as a weakness. I was annoyed when asked to be ""more liberal"" and outraged to vilify ""conservatives"". I believe being a slave to partisan ideology is what's deeply flawed in local government. When one extreme is in control, it is only natural to lurch towards the other side to find balance. In a culture where being sensational wins over being sensible, we get caught up in an endless partisan cycle. And so, the pendulum constantly swings for the few in power, leaving behind the many who live in the middle.
Ethics. Professionalism. Intelligence.
These are the pillars that support my leadership as an elected official, not a party label. I have regular conversations with progressives, conservatives and everyone in-between or beyond. I shape my decisions based on information from a wide range of perspectives. My opinions are not set in stone because I am open to new information. I have been criticized for my ambiguity, questioned if I will have staying power in elected office.
As the Presidential race slugs on, and the teeming stage of hopefuls dwindles for the chance to go against Trump, I think about Senator Klobuchar: how she remains steadfast in her leadership style, willing to take on the critics to prove leading from the middle really is a viable option.
I feel you, Amy. I feel you.

It's not that I haven't had anything to say. Quite the opposite. In the past eight months or so of being in office, I have been inspired, motivated, humbled and disheartened.
As I've gotten older and life has presented its opportunities and setbacks, I've worked hard at being thoughtful. My best thoughts then, become something purposeful through action and voice. This is the internal system I've developed. Largely this has meant I've become good at advocating for those who are not in the room, about issues I know well and care about.
Writing has long been a way for me bring voice to those issues. More than that, it is a deeply personal way for me to reflect, process and experience the world around me. Technically, I am a professional writer having been published in magazines and receiving recognition in local contests. Before taking office, writing was a field I was just beginning to develop a sense of accomplishment and competency in.
Then I took office and went silent. I haven't produced a meaningful article in months. In the past, before I took office, this was mostly because of ""writers block"".
Now, it's because I find myself in a space that is incredibly new and vast and complex. I did not know where to begin. I became mute. This is a good thing. Now, I am someone who is representing a lot of people who aren't in the room—approximately 65,000—about issues I don't know well—yet. Before, I had the luxury to focus and work on issues I personally cared about. Today, I don't have that luxury.
As an Anoka County Commissioner, I need to focus and work hard on all the issues I'm responsible for because my decisions affect other people's lives. If I'm going to speak about politics in public, I better know what I want to say.
If I'm being honest, I've also held back because of the subject matter. Before I took office, I wrote about community, the arts, travel; things that were safe and felt good. I wouldn't define politics as a safe or feel good topic. And I didn't get into politics to be safe or feel good. I'm leaning into being uncomfortable every day because it's the only door that leads to success. What I am having a hard time with, is translating politics into a realm I've long considered sacred—writing.
But I've decided this is just how it's got to be. I must write about politics because it's who I am. I must write about politics because it isn't safe or feels good. Politics needs to be humanized and shared, not kept on a dais.
So, these many months, I've been committed to learning about county government, my responsibilities and most importantly how I want to define what it means to be a County Commissioner. Although it is daunting to write about such a weighty profession as a fledgling, I am ready to start talking about it.
I invite you to come along on my journey.

In all professions, the interview process can be an anxiety ridden, grueling process. We put our best face forward and hope to persuade the person on the other side of the desk why we are the best person for the job over anyone else.
In politics, the interview process involves not just a few people, but whole communities.
Win or lose, candidates come out on the other side changed. It should be this way because it is a challenge like no other, encompassing all aspects of your life. As the only female candidate in my race, I had extra layers of scrutiny. Commentary about; my hemline, my motherhood, and my level of education being correlated to a lack of intelligence by some people. People would often tell me, ""You have to have thick skin to run for office."" This is true, but I found knowing who you are is a far better anchor.
During my campaign I talked about being a community service leader for the last decade, the issues that are important to me (promoting jobs in the trades, mental health and addiction issues and community development) and my attraction to county government because it's about the people in your own backyard. All these things are true. But why I ran is this: I am a connector and collaborator who believes civility should be part of politics and that helping people is what matters most.
All of this sounds good, I know. But what does it mean? What does it mean to be a good county commissioner?
This is the question that weighed the most on me the morning of Tues. January 8th, 2019 when I was sworn into office in a room full of family and friends. More than gender or ethnicity or age, what I cared most about was what it meant to be a good public servant and how I would uphold my duty.
In the meetings since my swearing-in, this question has only become heavier as I've only just begun to learn the intricacies of what exactly county government does and how it affects our lives. I have sat in meetings with my colleagues and county department heads with a growing appreciation of the definition of good governance. I thought I knew what it meant to be humble, and realize now it was false modesty I felt, not humility.
Humility is sitting alongside staff who have worked around the clock for days to protect as many people's benefits as humanly possibly from the partial government shut down. Humility is having the opportunity to represent the most vibrant and diverse district in Anoka County, understanding that not everyone wants me to have this job. Humility is knowing I won't always give everyone what they want and will still be responsible for my failure to meet their desires.
Humility is not having all the answers and forging a path forward anyway.
As I enter into this entirely new space for the first time, the campaign trail still smoldering behind me, I often think about the people I shook hands with asking for their vote, and the faith they have instilled in me for the next four years after one conversation. I wonder what I can tell them when I'm up at night, worried and excited about the opportunity they have given me.
And I think it's this: I worked hard to get the job and will work even harder to do the job. I look forward to what comes next.
I was sworn in as the first woman in this seat and the first person of color on the Anoka County Board on Tues. January 8th 2019 by Representative Connie Bernardy on a copy of the Constitution.

Last week, I took my teenaged daughter to see the classic ballet, Swan Lake. This was our first time seeing it, and we were both giddy with excitement. The auditorium was packed, dotted with little girls in velvet dresses and lithe, young dancers. When the ballet begins it is everything we hoped for; beautiful music, gorgeous costumes and breathtaking dancing. But when the Swan Princess enters, we lean in a little closer for a double take—she's Asian. We look at one another with understanding, she looks like us! In the traditional world of ballet, having anything different than a white prima ballerina is unusual and exciting.
Race and identity are issues I have wrestled with all my life. Truth be told, my race is the last thing I place my identity with. My order goes: Human being, woman, Asian. What this really means is that I have been given a lot of privilege from the stereotypes about my particular race (good at math, disciplined, high achiever) and therefore my race has not been a barrier as much as other ethnicities might experience. But my race has not left me completely unscathed either. I have been called derogatory names, been shunned as a youth when not with my Nordic family and am still sometimes asked why I don't speak ""my own language.""
I have a lot of complication. Although I was born in Korea, I came home to Minnesota to have a classic Midwestern childhood with a family of German descent. (Minnesota has the highest Korean adoptee population in the nation.) I ate Tater Tot Hotdish, drank cherry Kool-Aide and was a cheerleader for the football team. I grew up All-American because I am. Does this make me less Asian? Who decides what 'being Asian' means? These are the questions I have never had solid answers for.
What I do understand, is what it is like to be the only person in the room who is not white. This has been the usual experience for most of my life.
Most recently, I was at an event celebrating the retirement of a Columbia Heights officer. Across the room, a man is clicking away on his SLR camera. He is energetic and friendly with his subjects, a shock of white hair contrasts greatly to his dark skin. Eventually, I make my way towards him. His name is Phil and when I assume he is the event photographer, he laughs pleasantly and tells me, he is not. Photography is simply his passion and he's done it all over world. When I share I am running for Anoka County Commissioner, his excitement is obvious.
This is a common reaction for the mere fact that this seat hasn't been open in a very long time. It is an exciting time. But then he says something I do not expect and am not sure what do with, ""I am so happy a person of color is running!""
This throws me off. I redirect the topic to the issues I think are important and ask him to share his views. He talks about how things have changed since he moved to Columbia Heights 30 years ago, ""At first, there was not much diversity, but now there are many different cultures here, many different cultures, isn't it wonderful?! And now there is a person of color running!"" He is so jolly and heartfelt, I cannot help but be swept up in the enthusiasm. We take a picture and part ways.
At first, I didn't fully understand Phil's pleasure in my race. Then I remembered Swan Lake with my daughter and the excitement in seeing a version of ourselves represented in a significant role. Even though I don't put too much stock in what I look like, as a potential elected official, others may.
Being represented in leadership is a human need that isn't always available. Whether it's gender, or race, or any other kind of descriptor we have for ourselves, having representation gives us a sense of pride and hope. Through others, we see how we, too, might break barriers to achieve new goals.
Win or lose in November, seeing Phil's excitement in having, as he says ""a person of color"", run for office inspires me to represent all the parts of me well: An All-American Asian woman who lives in Anoka County.

Years ago, I was asked to do hair and make-up for a prestigious beauty pageant. I was intrigued and immediately said yes. I arrived backstage, curious and eager to be part of something glamorous. I enjoyed the gig, chatting while I combed and sprayed, powdered and glossed a room full of impossibly beautiful women. I was pleased to learn that underneath the gloss, the women ran the gamut. They were doctors and artists, veterans and cops, moms and TV personalities. Their individuality was apparent and glorious—when they weren't competing.
Onstage as competitors though, I couldn't help but notice they had more similarities then differences. They were all well trained, perfect candidates. And only one could be the best.
Once I decided to run for Anoka County Commissioner, I knew I had a lot to learn about what it meant to be a strong candidate and potential elected official. So I gathered the best team and advisers available to help me. If I wanted to be a relevant part of this political world, I needed to learn how to be in it.
I imagine it must be a similar process to prepare for a beauty pageant. Your sense of self—or more accurately the perception of what others think you are—is no longer your own. Every aspect of your person must be taken out, examined, and rearranged into an appealing package. If you've signed up to be a public figure, you better be OK with being on display and the judgment that comes with it.
Don't misunderstand me, I get it. When I was a regular voter like everyone else, I had a lot of expectations for candidates. And the closer they were to my own backyard, the more scrutiny I applied. I expected candidates to be well-spoken, well-informed and well-groomed. Underneath their appearance, I cared about their reputation by history: How engaged are they in community (before they started campaigning)? What is their education and work experience? What positions have they run for in the past? What is their track record as a past elected official? Sometimes I was not very lenient.
So now I find myself on the other side. I am taking all advice and criticisms about my candidacy seriously because I want to learn. I've heard commentary about my education, my personality, my physical stature and my hemline. Some things I have the desire and ability to change. Some I do not.
It's a tricky thing to navigate. I want to honor this political world by understanding it and living by its code. And I want to remain who I am in the process.
It's tricky because: Sometimes I am not well-spoken – the words utterly escape me when I need them the most. Sometimes I'm not well-enough-informed because no one can know everything about Anoka County. And sometimes I'm not a well-groomed candidate: sometimes I'm a frazzled mom.
I work towards meeting the expectations—the same expectations I have for any candidate—of my voters at all times. I'm applying for a serious job and need to demonstrate my ability to fulfill its duties and am learning everyday what that might mean for you.
I also have conviction to be true to myself. I refuse to rearrange parts of me to look great, at the expense of genuine content. Will this be enough to be the best candidate?
You'll get to decide in November.

29,/minnesota/fridley/unexpected-candidate,2018-04-25T19:50:43Z,I never thought I'd be doing this. ,0,0,Mandy Meisner,Local Official,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
I've been around politics enough to know it is a serious undertaking and not for the faint of heart. Although the inner workings have always been intriguing to me personally, one of the main things that has kept me out of politics, is well, politics. But wait, I'm jumping ahead of myself.
About two months ago I was standing in a crowd, chatting with various people supporting our House Representative, Connie Bernardy. I was mingling with people I knew, catching up about families and jobs, upcoming fundraisers and high school graduations. Commissioner Jim Kordiak, tapped my shoulder to say hello, something he has done a hundred times. He quickly pulls me aside. This was unusual.
We go to a quiet corner where he tells me he will be sending out a press release tomorrow morning announcing his retirement after 32 years of service. I am wordless. He's been our Commissioner for as long as I can remember. We stare at one another for several beats. He reminds me that I expressed interest in this role several years back, and now the chance is here. Whether I was ready or not.
This chance did not instill excitement in me, it instilled fear. Because it's true, I had expressed interest in this role, and my inner most networks knew this about me too. And here it was, presented with a smile in a quiet corner, topped with a shiny bow. Would I accept the gift, or politely decline?
I knew enough about politics to know things move quickly. Indecision is death before you can take your first gasp of air. I spent the next week in a flurry of concentrated examination. Why would I want to run (really)? What does it mean to be a County Commissioner? How will this affect my family? Every question colored with the hue of, could I serve my community well?
I'm lucky. I have people—specifically women—who have tremendous experience in the life of politics who I knew would be candid and tell me like it is.
And it's not pretty. It's hard. Really hard. Campaigning takes intelligence and stamina and mostly belief. Some would say you must have the belief you can win, or don't bother trying. For me, it is the belief that winning an elected seat means I will do something good in the world for others at my highest capacity. If I didn't believe this wholeheartedly, I wouldn't subject myself to this grueling process.
But I've struggled with—continue to struggle with—the perceptions and labels of ""politician."" Thoughts of manipulation, unfairness and insincerity leap to mind. That the systems and culture of politics often reward the cunning and punish the well-intentioned. Why would any ""nice"" person want to get involved with that?
I'll tell you why. Because politics are an inescapable element of our everyday lives. The very definition of politics means the keeping of power and influence. We gnash our teeth together over it, wanting it to change, knowing it will only shift again. Every employed adult understands this and every family member. It is human nature.
Becoming a politician for me became a philosophical question. When a good opportunity presents itself—however unexpected—do you grab it with both hands and run with it, or let it go?
I chose to run.

31,/minnesota/fridley/capitol-gains,2017-06-20T02:35:38Z,An inside scoop on the Minnesota capitol. ,0,0,Mandy Meisner,Local Official,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
Troy Olsen is one of the most unassuming men you will ever meet. Jolly might be the word that pops into your head when shaking his hand for the first time. His face evokes boyish features despite his middle-aged years. His open and kind nature expressed in clear, grey eyes and a calm soothing voice immediately puts you at ease. Midwestern values are revealed in a humble demeanor, and you can easily get swept away in his love of history whenever he talks about it. If not for his perpetual uniform of suit and tie, you would never guess he is in a profession that requires sharp intelligence, nimble people skills, and the intimate know-how of our legislature and its systems. He spent 20 years as a House of Representative's staff member, ending as the chief of sergeant-at-arms. Today, Troy is a well-known and respected lobbyist at Minnesota's Capitol.
Before I started work in community relations with the North Metro Mayors Association, I had a lot of misconceptions about what a lobbyist is and does. I held them as a whole in low regard, thinking they were merely ""big sticks for hire."" I'm embarrassed to say mainstream Hollywood and unfavorable media were my main resources for that opinion.
But in the last couple years I have been lucky to have a chance to understand—and work with—some of Minnesota's best, including Troy Olsen, the lead lobbyist for North Metro Mayors. I know now that a good lobbyist is an informed educator that our most successful legislators rely on to understand the huge amounts of complicated data in our bills—in proposed and passed (bills) alike. A good lobbyist needs to demonstrate accuracy and integrity for as long as they wish to have a career, as it doesn't take long for a bad reputation to force them out of the capitol, at least here in Minnesota.
I spent an afternoon with Troy to chat about some of his views about our political landscape and why politics is important.
___________________________________________
You've spent a lot of years at the Capitol, getting to know all the different aspects and challenges. What would you say is ""new"" there in ideas or policy?
In my 20 years of legislative activity, I have observed there seem to be fairly few truly new ideas and that many important issues take a long time to be resolved. A great example is the construction and connection of Highway 10, 610 and I-94 which took 30-40 years and the project still requires one more round of funding to complete.
By design, our system of lawmaking contains checks and balances so that public policy takes time to develop and is well-vetted before becoming law. We see this process unfold as we watch the evolution of legislation as it travels from its original conception, introduction to the legislature, travels through the committee process, is subject to negotiations between legislators, receives input from those affected by the legislation and advice from agencies or entities that will implement the new law.
I often read about the ""gridlock"" in politics. Publicly, it seems no one (Republicans or Democrats) is willing or able to problem solve. How many would you say actually are able to problem solve?
Most are. The public just doesn't hear about it as often as we should. Passionate sound bites are what get the attention today. But the people who work there every day can see that, truly, most legislators are willing to work together and hear each other out regardless of party identity.
Because contentious issues tend to garner the most attention, most people do not realize how much does get done in a bi-partisan manner. If you look through the House and Senate Journals and research the votes on bills that are not large funding packages, one finds that most of the bills that pass do so with bi-partisan votes. Even the final versions of large funding bills tend to receive support from both sides of the isle at the end of the process.
Many of us see politicians as right or left and we perceive lots of political drama. What's it really like at the Capitol? Is there more moderate behavior than gets reported?
America is a two party system and pretty much has been since George Washington's second term as president. For both parties, what might be seen as some to be a rigid ideological position may actually be a strongly held individual core value for an individual legislator that happens to fit into a particular political party. The abortion debate is a good example of that in that both sides tend to see the other as ""rigid"" or ""extreme"" and there is very little middle ground. America's early history holds plenty of examples of politicians who held ""rigid"" ideological positions. The political battles between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson are epic. It is possible that today's ""political drama"" is not that much different than back in the early days of this nation.
Let's talk about fake news. Misinformation is incredibly prevalent and spreads quickly on social media sites. How and what media platforms do you and your most respected colleagues use to get your information?
At the Capitol, print news can frequently be outdated the moment the ink hits the paper. I get a lot of my Capitol news via trusted sources on Twitter. Since most lobbyists are in-tune with what is happening around us, we can easily digest news delivered in the 146 characters of a Tweet. Minnesota is blessed to have an outstanding Capitol Press Corps who take pride in accurately reporting the happenings in St. Paul. The members of the press corps also hold each other accountable and though they consider themselves friends, they still compete for stories and are not afraid to publicly correct each other if something isn't reported factually.
It is also important to have an ability to anticipate what the news will be during the legislative session. This is easier for those of us who are at the Capitol following the legislative process on a daily basis than individuals watching from afar. The public should be skeptical of any news that seems extreme or outlandish and always consider the source and tone of the news.
Politically we are in opposition. I have always appreciated our ability to have conversations with ease and trust. I rely on you to present opposing information and perspectives that I know aren't colored by a debilitating bias. Who do you rely on for different information/perspectives?
An important part of a lobbyist's job is to educate legislators. Good lobbyists are willing and able to present both sides of an argument while presenting their case as to why/why not a legislator should support/oppose legislation they are being lobbied for/against. Lobbyists advocate on behalf of their clients, but must do so in an honest and educating way. I really don't rely on a single source for a balanced perspective though non-partisan staff at the legislature can be very helpful because they summarize legislation and answer questions in a neutral way.
As a lobbyist, I observe and learn from other lobbyists who demonstrate an ability to articulate both sides of an argument to get to a balanced perspective yet strongly are able to advocate on behalf of their cause or client.
What's your favorite thing about being a lobbyist?
The people. I genuinely like the people! I grew up in a small town and the Capitol reminds me culturally of a small town. I've been lucky to work with some incredible people (Republicans, Democrats and non-partisans) and am excited every day to go to work to do good things. The best legislators are the problem solvers. Most legislators can look at things in a non-political way because a lot of legislators came from other civic positions like a mayor or city council member. These roles provide good training and practice to work in a bipartisan way.
Do you think you'll ever tire of being in politics?
There are things that make me tired, like the nasty tearing down that appears to be common in campaigns these days. But politics, the processes and the people at the Capitol are in my blood. Just like living in a small town, we all ultimately decide that the benefits of being part of our community is worth the payment of few bumps along the way. That the gains far outweigh the losses.

32,/minnesota/fridley/fridley-citizens-support-new-civic-campus,2016-11-28T03:06:42Z,Fridley Citizens Support a New Civic Campus,0,0,Mandy Meisner,Local Official,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
Fridley City Council meetings do not typically attract large crowds. City operations of budgets, building permits and water issues just aren't that captivating. It's why we elected our council members to take care of these decisions in the first place. Always open to the public, most of the time our elected officials are perched in a semi-circle addressing an empty chamber at each meeting.
Most of the time.
Every once in a while, Fridley residents will shake off their sleepy indifference, put on their coats and hats, and drive to City Hall to hear for themselves about a major development in our community. Such was the case on November 14th when dozens of men and women squeezed shoulder to shoulder to listen and give voice to the issue of the new Civic Campus at the Columbia Arena site.
Our City Council voted unanimously in favor of making this new investment. Our current City Hall was designed and built to serve the Fridley of 1966. We have simply outgrown it. Independent studies have been done since 2013 to advise the best solution. Stay and repair, or move and build anew. Staying would cost us about $35M in required repairs and updates, but would leave us in a building that is inadequate to serve our community. Moving to Columbia Arena means building a new facility to appropriately house Police, Fire, Public Works, and City Government for an additional cost of $15M (total around $50M).
Building a new Civic Campus at Columbia Arena is the conclusion reached after years of analysis and public participation that helped to shape the final plan. This project will be funded by a $50M bond over the next 25 years, averaging less than $10 a month in taxes for the average valued home. This bond is a Capital Improvement Plan Bond, specifically designated for essential public buildings (MN statute 475.521) which does not require it be put to a public vote. However, it must be approved by the City Council, which it has.
This project has green lights across the board in funding, city approval and public engagement. Easy. Or it should be.
Like a storm on the horizon, there is opposition brewing and they are working hard to file a petition to stop this project and bring the Civic Campus to a referendum. On the surface, this sounds like a reasonable idea – shouldn't the voters be allowed a direct say in an investment like this? But should they gather enough signatures to force a referendum, it will cost $20K to run a special election and delay completion of the project by a year—assuming the special election results in a vote for the new Civic Campus. More importantly, the one year delay in the bonding process will add another $3M-$5M to the cost. Should the referendum not pass, we will be paying $35M anyway just to stay in our current location. Unfortunately, funding repairs on the current building will come out of our operating budget, meaning some city services will need to be reduced or eliminated.
Without a special bond for funding, no reserves or levy's available, some Police staff and services will have to be eliminated. Period.
At the city council meeting, 19 citizens spoke in support of the new Civic Center, and 4 spoke against it (of which two were simply unsure about the investment). One that spoke in opposition to a new Civic Campus was Pam Reynolds, a meticulous longtime Fridley resident who has a history of opposing City progress at nearly every turn. She argued that even though this decision was fully within the legal purview of the Council, it felt like Taxation Without Representation to her. She announced her intention to gather signatures to try to force the issue to a general election (with the accompanying delays and increased costs).
The opposition's position is built on the kind of rhetoric that promotes anger for perceived wrongs, clings to a past that no longer exists, and feeds on the fears of the uninformed.
It is not a question of being taxed for the costs of city buildings, it's a question of paying a lot to maintain old outdated buildings or investing in our future. The threat of having this project delayed with added expense, or possibly not happen at all, has inspired a private group called Fridley Citizens to campaign in support of the new City Campus. We are focusing on informing the public based on facts, and how our decisions will affect the community.
Our number one priority is to STOP A SUCCESSFUL PETITION from being filed on December 14th. If you are in support of the new Civic Campus:
A FEW FACTS: Public invitations have been extended to all Fridley residents since the Spring of 2015 involving: 800 hours of citizen input, 3 open houses, 3 city wide direct mailings, 9 city newsletters, 4 citizen workshops, 10 televised public meetings, and 13 Council workshops.
Many citizens have participated, many voices have been heard. Don't let a few outspoken critics now derail a thoughtful, fully vetted, and important decision.

33,/minnesota/fridley/locker-room,2016-10-11T03:09:25Z,In The Locker Room ,0,0,Mandy Meisner,Local Official,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
There is a saying that the true demonstration of one's character happens when no one is looking. I believe this, and it sends chills down my spine because there are times when no one is looking that I display the worst traits and behaviors of myself. Because no one is looking, I can be grumpy and bitter and just plain mean. Moments when I am my worst versions of myself because I've had a bad day or felt deeply wronged. We've all been there.
Then, there are situations when I am among people in a private setting where I feel secure and bond with others. This can look like a gathering of women holding babies in varying stages of contented smiles and disgruntled yelps, or sitting 'round a table, heads slightly bent with intent listening, delicately holding half empty wine glasses.
In these moments, in these settings, with these people, I can be candid in ways I may normally not be. I might say and share things that I would not to my husband, or my co-workers, or the general public. Things that may strike me as funny or clever at the time, but may in fact be off-color or sexist or deeply biased if vetted by the public. We've all been there.
So I understand the idea of off the record banter. Of letting your hair down and expressing private thoughts never meant for the public. I think we all do. But I think at the heart of these moments—be it alone or with others—we allow ourselves the opportunity to express our hidden selves. Parts we normally don't ""let out"" but are what we harbor inside.
The idea that abusive and derogatory views about women, as Donald Trump expressed in his video eleven years ago, should be a tolerable or acceptable form of male intimate bonding is repugnant. The idea that ""these things are said,"" that it is nothing more than ""locker room talk,"" is an unbelievable attempt to dismiss profane behavior.
The idea that there is a safe zone—the locker room—in which men can systematically debase and belittle women, that ""all men"" do this at one time or another is wrong and insults their sex. Not all men are like this. The ones who aren't, are the ones I want to see in office.
The fact that Trump's views of women were shared in a private moment is even more telling of his true nature. The defense that this was recorded eleven years ago, before he was in politics, doesn't soften my opinion. I have heard just as damaging and insulting commentary about women, minorities, and other experienced elected officials in public while running an active political campaign. Trump's private and public self doesn't seem to have much of a gap. He has blatantly and unabashedly showed us his character, over and over—audience or not, there is no filter or regulation of his person.
We are all looking. And it hasn't seemed to matter one bit.

35,/minnesota/fridley/getting-trumped-0,2016-05-04T02:22:13Z,Getting Trumped,0,0,Mandy Meisner,Local Official,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
I believe everyone has a right to come to their own political conclusions, even if that means they don't agree with mine. This is, after all, America.
Typically I stay away from blogging about politics. Mainly this is for two reasons. One, is that I believe politics, the legislative process and the politicians who practice them are a rich and complex system; one that I try to stay moderately informed about, but can never claim to have enough understanding and knowledge to shape a concrete opinion I would want to share publicly. Two, is to be frank, I'm a people pleaser and I hate the idea of ""offending anyone."" I have seen too often a heated debate or sharing of beliefs that can damage an otherwise fine relationship and I avoid that situation as often as I can.
I'm breaking away from my usual protocol because I see the real possibility of Donald Trump becoming a presidential candidate—possibly the President of the United States, and I am both repulsed and intrigued. Alarmed and saddened.
Because what I see is not the rise of a cutting-edge political star, nor a national statement demanding change, but the fall of our collective ability to understand issues and make informed choices. That we are getting trumped by disillusionment and the allure of false idols and we don't even know it. We are choosing sensationalism over ability, sound bites over content, and anger over intelligence.
Some people are gifted with strong skills and talents, but that does not necessarily make them legitimate in said skills. Let's take me as an example. I am and have always been very particular about labeling myself as a blogger—not a free-lance writer, even though that's what I do. I may be good with words and have the ability to influence, but that doesn't make my words true. One could argue I am nothing more than a literary manipulator, a digital storyteller.
What I am most definitely not is: a journalist, a novelist, or a reporter. I'm just an Average Jane living in the suburb of Fridley, Minnesota, who likes to write and is lucky to have a public medium to do so, and even luckier to have a few readers who might care what I have to say. To me, blogger proclaims I am an amateur and makes the clear distinction from those I have great respect for in the field — legitimate journalists and writers.
Donald Trump is a talented man. Clearly, he does well in business, TV ratings, and apparently gaining the confidence of the American people to be considered as a Presidential candidate. As the saying goes, It Takes Two to Tango and his current climb would not be possible without — well — us. This confounds me to no end because I passionately believe what Donald Trump is not, is a legitimate politician. He is a public personality.
I won't waste this space examining his political views and solutions; they are all the same — ridiculous in merit, thought, and execution. And his statements about women downright disgust me. All this is perfectly his right to hold dear and shout from the rooftops as an American man, but not as our Presidential Candidate. Our President should represent, as well as any human can, our best ideals, capabilities, and intentions possible. Not hate filled, preposterous and entertaining buzzwords.
So how in the world does he keep climbing? Because he understands people long for two things in a presidential race: blame and hope. Mr. Trump has no qualms to extort our fears shamelessly, and we seem to have no shame in submitting to them in exchange for a false sense of being revolutionary.
I am lucky to know and work with many local politicians in Minnesota. Some of whom I agree with politically, but not with their tactics. Others I may I respect their tactics, but disagree with politically. What they all have in common is the heart to serve their community in the best ways they know how, with the best intentions. They take the responsibility of leading — and perhaps failing — for the chance to get it right. Even once. They toil over countless decisions, and paperwork, and ridicule, to give someone else the hope that they might be, and have, better. To be a public servant, not a public figure. They are no Donald Trumps.
The price they pay is becoming a public personality, having their lives and those of their loved ones vulnerable to hostile examination in order to be a politician. None of them are public personalities trying to play politician.
As the 2016 Presidential Election develops and the real possibility of seeing Donald Trump on the GOP ticket becomes more likely, I can't help but blog about this in hopes to shake enough of us awake to scrutinize the direction and the reality of what getting Trumped would mean. Call me a hopeless optimistic, but I believe there is still time, and desire, and ability to collectively say we want the most capable leader, not the most sensational.
This is, after all, America.
This blog does not represent the opinions of any politician, community non-profit, or civic organization I work with and is my own personal opinions.

I was one of many people to ask Valerie Rolstad to run for the Minnesota House of Representatives. I am a ten year long volunteer and DFL supporter in our senate district. I have seen Valerie at every volunteer event working alongside our elected officials and grassroots activists. She has three decades of community involvement behind her. Valerie has fought in St. Paul as a citizen lobbyist to protect our local school funding, marched with fellow SEIU members in support of a living wage for all workers, understands the homelessness and unemployment issues facing our veterans, and has a passion for protecting the right to affordable healthcare. Valerie has worked with countless organizations and elected officials to accomplish these goals on behalf of the community because it was the right thing to do.
Valerie was also a lacrosse mom, girl scout troop leader, and hockey mom. As a hockey mom myself, I know what sort of dedication being on the District 3 Hockey Association Board takes. She has proven to be patient, knowledgeable, passionate, and dedicated to working for the good of our community.
As former legislative staff, I know Valerie Rolstad has what it takes to be an effective fighter for us in St. Paul. As legislative staff I was able to watch Valerie skillfully navigate the political arena to selflessly work for our community. Valerie is not running because there is an open seat, she is running because her friends and fellow community members asked her to represent us and our families in St. Paul. Valerie Rolstad is running because she feels a duty to continue her advocacy for us. I ask you to attend your precinct caucus on March 1 to become a delegate to the Senate District 41 convention, where you can vote for Valerie to receive the DFL endorsement.

Our district is in a unique situation. With State Senator Goodwin's retirement, her senate seat becomes vacant when her term ends. Both current SD 41 Representatives Connie Bernardy (41A) and Carolyn Laine (41B) are running for the DFL endorsement to run for this Senate seat. If Representative Bernardy wins the DFL endorsement on April 2nd, her House seat will be vacant and Valerie Rolstad will ask you for the DFL endorsement for Bernardy's House seat.
If you are lost, don't worry - it is confusing!
All you need to do is show up to your caucus location on March 1st at 7:00 pm to become a delegate to the Senate District 41 convention, then you attend the convention on April 2nd to vote for Valerie to receive the endorsement. Stick with me, friends: 1) Caucus and become a delegate, 2) Show up to the convention to vote.
An example of a caucus: Last time I caucused was at Fridley Middle School. I arrived and found the classroom for my precinct. If you don't know the precinct you live in there will be someone at a welcome table to help you. Once I found the classroom for my precinct I met some neighbors that I did not know (FUN!). We talked about issues we cared about - small precinct issues up to the BIG issues. Some people had resolutions prepared. This means that they wrote down an issue they cared about and detailed a specific action they wanted taken and who they wanted to take the action. If the resolution is supported by the majority of people in the room it is sent to the district convention. If it passes the district convention it has the ability to be sent to the state convention. During this caucus meeting you can become a delegate. This means that you have voting rights at the SD 41 convention on April 2 and you can vote to give Valerie Rolstad the DFL endorsement to run for the House of Representatives as the true-blue DFL'er that she is!

Valerie Rolstad is a lifelong member of our community. She grew up in Columbia Heights and graduated from Columbia Heights High School before graduating from the College of Saint Teresa with a Bachelor's Degree in Social Work. Valerie and her husband of 30 years raised their three children in the community where they were the third generation to receive their degrees from CHHS.
Valerie currently lives in Fridley and works at Columbia Academy in Columbia Heights as a special education educational assistant. Her professional focus is on students with Autism Spectrum Disorder, she also has experience in Emotional Behavior Disorder. Valerie's volunteer experience includes leading her daughter's Girl Scout troop, leading the Fridley Women of Today, as both a member and chapter president, engaging in Fridley-based community projects and fundraising for the March of Dimes, juvenile diabetes, and other local charities. Valerie volunteered with North Park Elementary and Central Middle School PTO where she was an integral part of both school fundraising and event planning teams. When funding was slashed under Governor Ventura in the Columbia Heights School District, Valerie, with two other parents, founded The Parent Partnership for Education, a parent committee that organized lobbying efforts in St. Paul to raise awareness of education funding disparities. Her effective work on the Columbia Heights Referendum Campaign provided funds for much needed technology access in classrooms as well as protecting funding for basic maintenance to all Columbia Heights schools to ensure students were able to attend classes in a safe, healthy environment.
Valerie served under governor appointment on the Special Education Task Force and the Collaborative Governance Council under Chair Rebecca Otto. She is also a proud hockey, soccer, tennis, and lacrosse mom. As a youth hockey mom, she was on the East River Hockey Association Board as well as the District 3 Hockey Association Board. Valerie also collaborated with community members in an effort to save the Columbia Hockey Arena. Valerie has worked with Minnesotans for a Fair Economy to support a living wage for all workers. She has extensive experience lobbying and building relationships in St. Paul for education funding and in support of home health care workers efforts to organize to earn a living wage.
Valerie is running for the House of Representatives in District 41A to continue the cohesive and collaborative work the voters of this district have been lucky enough to enjoy under the current leadership. Her close relationship with our leadership guarantees voters that she will be be able to work as a team and across party lines. As a lifelong resident, Valerie knows what this community can achieve and what this community deserves from representation in St. Paul."

Valerie's involvement with SEIU dates back to the 1999/2000 school year when the Columbia Academy support staff unit first organized. She has been on her bargaining team since its conception. In 2004, she took a leave of absence from Columbia Academy to work on what would become America Votes, where she was an organizer and worked with volunteers to door knock, phone bank, and truly learn how to positively impact a major political issues campaign. America Votes brings together more than 400 state and national organizations to focus on supporting year round progressive campaigns. Valerie's purpose with America Votes was to register voters and assist in implementing its get out the vote (GOTV) strategy.
Valerie worked as an organizer for SEIU Local 284 to engage members in becoming more involved through participation in the political process. During this time, she was appointed and re-elected twice by her peers, to the SEIU Executive Board. She is currently in her third, three-year term. Her role on the Executive Board includes serving on the Budget and Finance Committee and chairing the Committee on Political Education (COPE).
Valerie also sits on the SEIU Minnesota State Council as an At-Large member. In this position she works on SEIU budget and finance decisions, political endorsements, and bringing national platform issues to her Local to structure its goals accordingly.
Valerie's SEIU involvement has allowed her to perform coalition work with Minnesotans Fight for a Fair Economy, Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha (CTLU), ISAIAH, NOC, and Take Action Minnesota. It has also given her in depth knowledge on the legislative process by allowing her to lobby and educate legislators in support of public education and health care issues, among others. This has given Valerie Rolstad the understanding and experience of how to actually take an idea, put it into bill form, and see the bill through the process until it is signed into law. Such an understanding is vital for our next State Representative in SD 41A."

I don't know about you, but the November 3rd Election coming up is causing me great anxiety. The climate of politics today is worse than it has ever been. Friends and family, neighbors and work colleagues are divided, arguing not over policies but the rhetoric tied to party politics. There has never been a President in our history who has impassioned and alienated the world and each other more than President Trump has in the last four years. While this dramatic political culture has inspired many people to vote, there is another forgotten group out there. A group I met in 2018 at their doors.
One of the general rules about door knocking is that you have to keep moving. Don't spend too much time on any one door if you can help it because there are just too many doors to hit. It's a relentless pace that grinds you down under the sweltering heat of summer, the dampness of rain, and the chill of the first snow fall. Keep moving. But there were people I consistently broke this rule for and spent a lot of time with. They were the ones who told me they didn't plan to vote.

The theme that arose as I passionately argued in their doorways was this: My vote doesn't count because politicians are all the same. I get it. But what people can often forget is the importance of our local races. Local government is about your own backyard. Our school boards, city and county government have more influence in your everyday life than the President.

Your school board members create student policies that allow—or don't allow—conversations about gender equality and sexual consent. Your city council members decide the pace of economic development and funding of your local police force. Your county commissioners help our neighbors get food and medical assistance and job training and set the ethical standards that oversee a staff of 2,000. Your vote absolutely matters in shaping your community.
Like any profession, we think politics can attract a certain ""kind"" of person: aggressive, egotistic, overly ambitious and calculating. ""Good"" people never run for office. They'd get eaten alive. Or lose. These beliefs have not only held me back in the past, they are plain wrong. I have never fit the classic mold of politician and yet here I am. Serving with a heart for community service, a hunger to learn and the desire to build a legacy for our county. And I hope to inspire others who share my brand of politics to run for office and break the standard mold too.
I have been in the minority in my views since month two on the job when I advocated for a fair and open interview process to hire our County Administrator rather than directly appoint our Board Chair *. My first resolution in 2020 to allow 10 minutes for the public to speak at board meetings was voted down**. As the first person of color on this board representing the most diverse district in the county, I work hard to forward diversity and inclusion.
I also don't agree with the current dichotomy of fiscal responsibility and lack of vision. We can and should keep taxes low and be mindful of our debt, but we also need to ensure we support our staff financially (which includes funding our Attorney and Sheriff's Office) while additionally shaping a vision for our community. Imagine our region without a National Sports Center or a TPC Golf Course. These are investments of our past. What are we building for our future? We can do more than keep the lights on while still being responsible with our taxpayer dollars. It's not an either/or, it's an and.
I understand the allure to be cynical about government during these diabolical times. Cynicism or choosing to stay safe is tempting for the strongest of us. But I write this with heartfelt sincerity, your voice is important. It has the power to change the world from ""all politicians are the same"" to a world of diverse leadership who can embrace possibility and not just the financial bottom line.
Don't give up or surrender to the path with least resistance. Don't give up your voice. Vote.
