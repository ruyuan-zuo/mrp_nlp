Dear Governor Pritzker,
During this unprecedented challenge to our state, you stressed multiple times your willingness and eagerness to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle and from every part of the state. As the women of the House Republican Caucus, we stand ready to offer solutions and work with you to implement a safe and reasonable regional plan to open Illinois. We are business owners, scientists, mayors, lawyers, community organizers, volunteers, officers, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, caregivers, and legislators. We represent 880,000 Illinoisans across all regions of the state—from the Chicago suburbs to regions in northern, western, eastern, southern, and central Illinois.
Our family members and constituents are fighting on the front lines as healthcare workers. We know and love people who are diagnosed with and suffering from COVID-19. We know, love, and represent people who lost their jobs, closed their small businesses, and exhausted their savings. For us, this is not political. This is personal.
We asked many questions concerning IDPH modeling, PPE procurement process and inventory, IDOC policies for transfers and releases, issues at IDES, safeguarding Long Term Care Facilities, and protecting state facilities for veterans and the developmentally disabled. We made many suggestions to promote physical and mental wellbeing, including opening state parks, locking down our prisons, housing our homeless, and protecting our most vulnerable populations. You did respond to our request for IDNR to open our state parks, thank you.
Unfortunately, a majority of our questions and suggestions are not acknowledged. We reached out to you, but you have not contacted one Republican woman legislator to discuss our concerns, suggestions, or solutions. We are writing to tell you as a matter of record the House Republican Women are here for Illinois. We are ready to offer suggestions, strategies, and solutions; and we are calling for the legislature to reconvene. We want to do our job as essential employees for our state and want to work with you to safely and regionally reopen our state.
SAFELY
● As elected officials, we have a responsibility to all Illinois citizens. Our number one priority as wereopen Illinois is to protect those who are vulnerable to this virus and ensure they have the appropriate support and necessary resources.
REASONABLY
● Illinois needs a reasoned and common-sense plan to reopen our state region by region understanding the virus affects each region differently. Some of these common sense steps include:
RESPONSIBLY
● Our constituents deserve a responsible government—a government where there are effective checks and balances and a government where all voices are heard. A responsible government means calling the legislature back to session.
REGIONALLY
● One size does not fit all. We must safely open our state on a regional basis. Other states including New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa proposed measured, regional reopening strategies.
We, the women of the House Republican Caucus, ask you to work with us. We are prepared to work on a serious plan to reopen Illinois safely, reasonably, responsibly, and regionally. We request you meet with us collectively as a group to share our ideas and offer solutions. We must continue to protect our vulnerable populations and safeguard our healthcare delivery systems, while we must also save our economy and our families. We are prepared to assist in developing and implementing a plan to safely get Illinois back to business reasonably, regionally, and responsibly.
Finally, as members of a co-equal branch of government, we request you call a special legislative session to start work on reopening Illinois safely and regionally.
We are ready and await a meeting with you.
Sincerely,
Rep. Avery Bourne
Rep. Terri Bryant

Another measure has been filed to create a taxpayer-funded program to ensure Illinois residents have their first two years of college tuition paid for.
State Sen. Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant, D-Shorewood, filed Senate Bill 2324 on Jan. 8. It mirrors legislation filed in 2019 by Chicago Democratic state Rep. Will Guzzardi. The new bill would ensure residents ""seeking an associate degree, certificate, or diploma from an institution of higher learning"" a taxpayer-funded state grant that would pay for tuition and fees, minus any other aid awarded, starting in 2021.
The bill said the cost could exceed that of a local community college's tuition and fees.
The measure is part of a national push for states to offer grants for the first two years of higher education, called College Promise.
Campaign Executive Director Martha Kanter said more than 300 local communities and 25 states have committed to providing some sort of grants to students in their first couple of years of higher education.
""Most of them are seeking to make the first one or two years of college universally available,"" she said Wednesday.
The program would be implemented through the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, which could set parameters on who is eligible.
Washington state's ""Washington College Promise"" has a household income limit of $61,000 for partial tuition and $44,000 for full tuition grants. Other states have grade and class load requirements. New York's Excelsior program cuts off eligibility for families who make more than $125,000 a year.
The money would come from potential donors and Illinois' annual state budget, which economists have deemed shaky at best and one of only a couple that is unprepared to weather a moderate recession. Should an economic downturn occur, it would put pressure on the state's budget while simultaneously making the proposed program more costly since job retraining at community colleges typically spikes during recessions. Kanter said the organization is diligent, watching for states that may break their promise to pay for school.
Statewide programs can be expensive. In California, lawmakers added $42.6 million to the state's current budget to support the second year of free tuition for about 33,000 students, according to EdSource. Washington state estimates it will support more than 90,000 students in 2021.
Kanter said the programs often expand as demand increases for free schooling.
The University of Illinois already has a tuition guarantee program called the Illinois Commitment that provides four-year students who reside in Illinois and come from a family with less than $61,000 in household income a grant paying for tuition and mandatory fees.

""Betty Stukel was denied the opportunity for proper assessment and standard medical care at Alden Courts of Shorewood and as a direct result she suffered rental failure, dehydration"" and a urinary tract infection, argues the lawsuit filed by Michael Stukel, administrator of her estate.
The plaintiff retained the Chicago law firm of Kralovec, Jambois & Schwartz. The defendants consist of: Dial Willow Falls, Dial Senior Management Inc., Alden Courts of Shorewood, Alden Management Services and Alden Estates of Shorewood.
According to her obituary published by Fred C. Dames Funeral Home, Betty Stukel had retired from the dental office of Dr. Nicholas Grabavoy after 15 years of service. She previously worked for the Joliet Area YMCA and Joliet School District 86.
""A devout Catholic, Betty was a member of St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church and an avid bingo player. Betty was blessed and blessed others with a remarkable 90 years of giving and sharing her joy and love,"" her obituary reads.
So far, the defendants have not filed any legal briefs in response to the lawsuit.
Patch left a message seeking comment on Tuesday with Alden management representatives in Chicago, but no one called back.
On Sept. 26, a board-certified physician licensed to practice medicine submitted his medical opinion regarding last year's death of Betty Stukel as part of the plaintiff's suit.
As is customary in such lawsuits, the physician's name is redacted from the court records.
""Betty Stukel was a 91-year-old woman with a medical history including arthritis, bilateral knee replacement, falls with complications including brain bleed and dementia. She was not decisional,"" the medical expert opined, in a letter provided to the plaintiff's Chicago law firm.
Betty Stukel fractured her left hip on Oct. 4, 2017, causing her to remain hospitalized at Presence St. Joseph Medical Center for 17 days, according to the plaintiff.
Afterward, she was admitted to Alden Estates of Shorewood for skilled therapy, where she developed skin impairments in November 2017, according to the lawsuit.
By Nov. 30, 2017, Betty Stukel was moved to the memory care unit at Alden Courts in Shorewood. ""She was assessed as at risk for dehydration due to her dementia because she would forget to drink and how to drink, although her initial care planning did not address this risk,"" the plaintiff's physician expert wrote in a letter accompanying the lawsuit.
(Article continues below this photo.)
During her first three weeks at Alden Courts in Shorewood, Betty Stukel lost 12 pounds and ""she continued to lose weight over the following weeks and months, yet the physician was not notified. She also suffered four falls,"" the plaintiff's contend.
By Jan. 6, 2018, Betty Stukel was transferred back to St. Joe's hospital because she was dehydrated. After three days in the Joliet hospital, she was discharged to home hospice. She died on Jan. 18, 2018, the lawsuit notes.
""The Alden Courts of Shorewood staff failed to promptly notify the physician about her poor intake and general declining condition,"" the plaintiff's medical expert stated. ""They also failed to recommend a patient care conference with the family to discuss treatment options and end of life wishes.
""Betty Stukel was denied the opportunity for proper assessment and standard medical care at Alden Courts of Shorewood ... These deviations and injuries at Alden Courts of Shorewood caused significant pain and distress, led to hospital care and ongoing care needs, caused Betty Stukel's overall decline and deconditioning and contributed to her death,"" the plaintiff's physician expert stated.
Willows Falls Retirement Community was also named in the lawsuit because that's where Betty Stukel resided prior to her steep decline in health in 2017.
The lawsuit states that Willow Falls failed to protect the resident from abuse and or neglect.
According to court records, Betty Stukel resided at Willow Falls Retirement Community from Dec. 18, 2015 until Oct. 4, 2017, she then stayed at Alden Estates of Shorewood from Oct. 20, 2017 through Nov. 30, 2017 and Alden Courts of Shorewood from Nov. 30, 2017 until Jan. 12, 2018."

The son of recently retired Will County Circuit Judge Carla Alessio-Policandriotes learned at his Aug. 23 court hearing that he needed to report for random drug testing that day. Instead, Goode left the courthouse, court records show.
A bench warrant was immediately issued for his arrest. But two months later, the Will County Sheriff's Office has yet to take Goode into custody. Court records indicate that Goode currently resides in the 900 block of Shorewood's Valencia Drive.
According to court records, the following events happened at the courthouse on Aug. 23:
Because Goode is accused of violating the conditions of his bond, a judge has ordered the defendant will remain incarcerated without bail, pending the disposition of his October 2018 criminal case.
Goode, formerly of Channahon, is charged with four counts of domestic battery against his now-ex-wife.
Joliet Patch previously reported that Goode, now 34, had punched his wife in her mouth back on Oct. 12, 2018 and then he yanked her out of a Hummer Jeep, left her on a road near Coal City area and then drove off, according to court documents.
Goode's ex-wife obtained a protection order against Goode, writing the judge: ""I believe he could kill me. I don't know what he is capable of and am fearful of what he might do next if he is released from jail.""
Goode remained in Will County's Jail between Dec. 6, 2018 and Feb. 19, 2019, at which time Will County Judge Edward Burmila agreed to modify the conditions of Goode's bail, Patch reported at the time.
Then, in July, a judge ordered that Goode's ""bond is modified and he shall be required to continue to participate in any treatment that was recommended by family guidance and comply with the terms of their program. This includes maintain (sic) contact with any assigned counselors, attend groups as directed and drug test as ordered."""

PLAINFIELD — A new law co-sponsored by State Senator Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant (D-Shorewood) will put an end to misleading accounting practices in the governor's office.
House Bill 5121, which was signed into law Tuesday, ends the practice of ""offshoring"" the governor's payroll costs within state agencies – a practice that depletes funds for vital state programs.
""Taxpayers deserve to know how state dollars are being spent,"" Bertino-Tarrant said, ""This new commonsense law promotes transparency and responsible accounting to ensure state dollars are spent wisely and responsibly.""
This measure was passed in response to reports that nearly 60 percent of employees currently working for the governor's office are paid by state agencies with funds intended for priorities such as economic development, public safety and child protection.
Offshoring has been utilized by governors of both parties for years to make it appear their office budgets are smaller than they actually are.
Examples of offshoring include paying the governor's education advisor $250,000 from the Department of Human Services budget or a deputy chief of staff $140,000 from the Illinois State Police budget.
The most recent payroll data shows only 44 of 102 employees in Gov. Bruce Rauner's office are paid from the governor's budget. The rest – 58 staffers – are hidden in other agencies' payrolls.
If the governor's entire staff was accurately reported, his office budget would come in at more than $10 million, instead of the $4.9 million budgeted for the current fiscal year."

SPRINGFIELD – The General Assembly may soon have a better idea on how to combat the opioid epidemic sweeping the nation.
State Senator Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant (D-Shorewood) advanced a bipartisan measure this week that would require the Illinois Department of Public Health to annually report to the General Assembly on data collected concerning opioid overdose related deaths.
""The national opioid epidemic has affected all of us,"" Bertino-Tarrant said. ""A major component of combating this issue is ensuring that we have a complete picture of this crisis. This new measure will give us additional information to ensure the General Assembly has every tool available to institute meaningful legislation to overdoses related deaths and fight addiction in our communities.""
DPH would be required to report the data broken down by each county. Bertino-Tarrant believes it is important to localize the data as much as possible to work with local law enforcement, mental health providers and school districts to fight this crisis from every angle.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 115 people die every day in the United State of an opioid overdose — about 42,000 in 2016.
""Addiction does not see age, socioeconomic standing or race,"" Bertino-Tarrant said. ""This is a national epidemic that we must work together to fight. Every life we save is priceless.""
Under House Bill 4331, hospitals must include the age, gender, race and county of residence of each patient that a hospital diagnoses as having an opioid overdose within 48 hours of the diagnosis.
Additionally, in every case in which an opioid overdose is determined to be a contributing factor in a death, a coroner must report the death and the age, gender, race and county of residence of the decedent to DPH.
House Bill 4331 passed the Senate's Committee on Public Health with bipartisan support."

STAUNTON—State Senator Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant, the new chairwoman of the Illinois Senate Education Committee, continued her statewide ""Chalk Talk"" tour of schools on Monday at Staunton Community Unit School District 6.
Bertino-Tarrant and local State Senator Andy Manar (D-Bunker Hill) met with members of the District Improvement Team to discuss the teacher shortage faced by many schools in the area.
""For far too long we have been using legislative Band-Aids as solutions to address the teacher shortage across Illinois,"" Bertino-Tarrant said. ""We need to get to the root of the problem to guarantee our children and teachers have the means to be successful.
""Visits and discussions like these help me gain a better understanding of how decisions we make in Springfield impact children and educators throughout the state,"" she added.
Bertino-Tarrant and Manar have sponsored measures that would make college more affordable for new teachers, making it easier for retired teachers to fill in as substitute teachers and streamlining the teacher licensure process.
""It's important that the chair of the Senate Education Committee visits smaller towns and schools in Illinois,"" Manar said. ""Having Senator Bertino-Tarrant here today is valuable because we live in a diverse state, and it's important that schools in the 48th Senate District are heard in Springfield.""
Manar and Bertino-Tarrant participated in a group discussion led by Staunton Superintendent Dan Cox to address the challenges facing Staunton schools, such as high class sizes, lack of social emotional supports for students and a lack of core interventions services.
""Senator Manar and Senator Bertino-Tarrant have long been champions for education,"" Cox said. ""By them taking the time to visit schools and listen to teachers in the field, it shows their commitment to working with us as partners to build great schools for our young people and our communities.""
Under the new school funding formula championed by Manar and Bertino-Tarrant last year, Staunton Community Unit School District 6 schools will receive an additional $421,337 in state funding.
""In my eighth year as superintendent of schools, this is the first time I have been able to have discussions about how to invest new resources into our schools instead of having discussions about which programs and services to cut,"" Cox said."

PLAINFIELD- Illinois taxpayers will now have a new tool to see if state agencies pay their bills in a timely manner.
House Bill 3649, supported State Senator Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant (D-Shorewood), which requires state agencies to provide a more accurate accounting of bills and late payment interest penalties accruing will go into effect on the first day of the New Year.
""Taxpayers deserve to know how their money is spent,"" Bertino-Tarrant said. ""This new law will lead to responsible accounting and a good step in building the taxpayer's trust in state agencies and services.""
Currently, state law requires that on October 1 agencies report the annual total of bills that were unpaid as of June 30."" The comptroller's office then publishes the outdated information on their website.
Bertino-Tarrant believes real-time reporting will allow state agencies, financial officers and the Illinois General Assembly to make better financial decisions. The state's unprecedented fiscal challenges require a full weighing of outstanding vouchers and the ramifications of an increasing unpaid bill backlog.
Once in effect, House Bill 3649 will require state agencies to report the amount of unpaid bills, whether that amount was appropriated or not, and an estimate of interest penalties accumulated on a monthly basis.
""Open books will lead to accurate and transparent accounting,"" Bertino-Tarrant said. ""The State of Illinois needs to promote the responsible use of public dollars to guarantee every cent is spent wisely and reliably.""
Senate and House worked in a bipartisan manner to override the governor's veto during the fall veto session."

Kathleen F. Murphy was booked into Will County shortly before 4 p.m. Tuesday. She was located in Hickory Hills. Murphy has been charged with one felony count of violating the state's sex offender registry. Her bond has been set at $50,000, meaning she must come up with $5,000 to free herself from jail while her case is pending at the Will County Courthouse.
The Shorewood Police Department filed a criminal complaint against Murphy in Will County Circuit Court on September 6 in connection with allegations that the village resident did not register her current address with authorities as part of her mandatory compliance with the sex offender registry. A warrant for her arrest was then issued. Murphy had maintained that she was living on Oak Drive, according to Shorewood police officials. Police told Patch on Friday that Murphy listed the address as her permanent place of residence without permission of the people living there.
The state registry reflects that Murphy was 49 at the time of her crime and her victim was 14. Her offense happened in Cook County, and she previously has lived in Hickory Hills.

This week, Joliet personal injury attorney Adam Zayed of Zayed Law Offices filed a civil lawsuit against Shorewood-Troy Public Library, 650 Deerwood Drive, on behalf of Flanagan. The lawsuit demands a judgment against the Shorewood-Troy Public Library in excess of $50,000.
According to their complaint, a spring-loaded library cart was left out in an area of the Shorewood-Troy Public Library ""that would create confusion for library patrons.""
On September 22, 2016, ""while distracted and or preoccupied, (Flanagan) leaned against the spring-loaded library cart and said cart collapsed,"" his lawsuit contends. Attorney Zayed argues the library employees ""knew or had reason to suspect that library patrons would not appreciate the hazard presented by the spring-loaded library cart.""
All told, Flanagan's lawyer listed eight separate allegations of carelessness and negligence committed by Shorewood-Troy library employees in the incident at hand. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.)
Besides negligence, the public library is accused of willful and wanton misconduct. Shorewood-Troy Public Library director Jennie Mills replied in an email to Patch that the library does not comment on pending litigation and that she could not offer any further comment.
According to Zayed, ""as a direct and proximate result of one or more of the aforementioned willful and wanton acts or omissions, Plaintiff Flanagan has suffered injuries of a permanent, personal and pecuniary nature.""
The Will County civil lawsuit, however, does not make clear the nature of Flanagan's injuries or whether he was hospitalized. Multiple messages left with the Zayed Law Firm seeking comment went unreturned on Wednesday and Thursday.
This summer, Zayed also filed a lawsuit against the Shorewood Walmart after Yvonne Tafoya of Joliet slipped and fell inside the Walmart store on a piece of fruit back in July 2016. The Walmart lawsuit is set for a court hearing in October.

The senator announced on Friday that a new law that takes effect in January will require the Illinois Department of Human Services to maintain a website to educate people about heroin and prescription opioid abuses. This website will include warning signs of addiction and tips for parents on how to best discuss the dangers of drug addiction with their children. Information will also be posted online about treatment options and services to get help.
""This new website will get information and important resources to the families and people who need them,"" Bertino-Tarrant said in a statement issued by her staff.
The fact that seventy-seven people died last year across Will County related to heroin and opioid-related abuses shows the seriousness of the drug problem on a local level, according to Bertino-Tarrant.
And it's not just a big city problem. Drug overdoses have impacted area villages including Shorewood.
This summer, 25-year-old Shorewood resident Christopher Shanine was found dead near his bicycle in a parkway inside the Kipling Estates subdivision. The Will County Coroner's Office later determined that Shanine died from Fentanyl Intoxication. His death was ruled to be an accidental drug overdose.

John apparently did not even know him, but he was basically harassing my client to get him a drink. My client left and went to get cigarettes.""
John Bailey
Fransen maintains that both of her clients are the true victims here. However, that will be determined by Will County's courts at a later date. Last year's story in the Joliet Patch reported that Bailey, Troesch and Ward, were all arrested after the late-night summer fracas began at Bedrocks but ultimately ended up with arrows being shot, vehicles being rammed, and Joliet police intervention needed to defuse the volatile situation.
According to the recent lawsuit, Troesch is accused of using Ward's 2002 Saturn to ""intentionally collide with and against John's 2007 Mercedes Benz."" On the other hand, the plaintiff's lawsuit states, Bailey and Delatorre ""were in the exercise of ordinary care and caution for their own safety and property.""
Kevin Troesch
""It just escalated ... John suffered a broken arm and Alberto suffered serious back injuries,"" Fransen told Patch.
As for Bedrocks, the bar in Shorewood is accused in the civil suit of over-serving Ward and Troesch.
The bar's employees ""sold or gave alcoholic beverages to Ward and Troesch, which then and there Ward and Troesch consumed. These alcoholic beverages caused the intoxication of Ward and Troesch and while intoxicated and as a result of this intoxication, caused the serious car accidents while traveling eastbound on (U.S. 52) in the village of Shorewood and City of Joliet ... in which John was driving and Alberto was a passenger, injuring him.""

Lottery officials called the suspension of Powerball and Mega Millions an ""unprecedented step.""
For Powerball — which currently has a $92 million jackpot — all tickets purchased before the cutoff will be valid. All subscriptions will be cut off after the last drawing on June 28, and the lottery will issue refunds to players for the remaining length of their subscriptions. ""When a Fiscal Year 2018 appropriation for the Illinois Lottery is passed, the Lottery will work with the Multi-State Lottery Association to determine a path for the return of Powerball sales,"" Lottery officials said. ""The timing is unknown.""
The rules for Mega Millions tickets and subscriptions are the same, although Mega Millions ticket sales would resume as soon as an appropriation for the Illinois Lottery is passed by the General Assembly.
Effective July 1, players with valid claims of more than $25,000 will experience a delay in payments due to the budget impasse, lotto officials said.

""Players should be confident knowing the Illinois Lottery has the money to pay these winning claims,"" Illinois Lottery Acting Director Greg Smith said in a statement. ""That means the General Assembly needs to approve a truly balanced budget that includes Lottery funding in order to ensure all prize payments will occur.""
It's not the first time lottery winners have faced delays in receiving their winnings. In 2015, the ;ottery didn't have Fiscal Year 2016 appropriation authority to pay winners until December, resulting in nearly 3,900 valid claims being delayed, totaling more than $112 million. Within a month of receiving an appropriation, all valid claims were paid to winners.
The lottery said it will continue to pay valid claims of $25,000 or less at any of the five Lottery Prize Centers located throughout Illinois – Chicago, Des Plaines, Fairview Heights, Rockford and Springfield."

Local officials are urging residents to get their tests done during the springtime with help from the village's partner company, BSI Online.
""Studies have found that the most common cross-connections come from irrigation systems since water can accumulate by the sprinkler heads,"" said a recent Shorewood notice. ""If there is a loss in water pressure, water could be sucked back through the pipes bringing any chemical fertilizer, pesticides, animal waste or other bacteria and parasites that were on the ground back into your plumbing system.""
Those needing to facilitate their annual ""backflow assembly"" RPZ test can begin the process online. They must then submit the findings to the village.
Residents with questions are encouraged to call the Village of Shorewood Building Department at 815-553-2310.

19,/illinois/shorewood-il/threats-protest-prompt-fundraiser-s-cancellation,2017-02-23T16:37:55Z,Threats of Protest Prompt Fundraiser's Cancelation,0,0,Joseph Hosey,Patch Staff,"HOMER GLEN, IL — Threats to protest a fundraiser for a Will County board member who made an inflammatory Facebook post about the Women's March on Washington have prompted the event's cancelation.
Homer Glen Republican Steve Balich was supposed to have a Thursday night fundraiser at Mullets bar on South Bell Road. But Balich said Mullets called his event off Feb. 16.
""They canceled on Thursday and my fundraiser is today,"" Balich said.
""The reason the fundraiser was called off was Mullets was getting calls that there were going to be marches there,"" Balich said.
The callers claimed the planned protest had been organized by Father Michael Pfleger, Balich said, but the county board member was skeptical.""It's not true,"" Balich said, adding that he suspects the callers were funded by the group Organizing For Action.
""They're paid protesters,"" he said.
Balich drew criticism in recent weeks when he posted an excerpt of a Dan Proft essay titled ""What's Left of the Left"" that referred to participants in the Women's March on Washington as ""grumpy old women and their wives.""
""If we learned one thing from Obama, speechifying doesn't bring the country together, create jobs or reverse barbaric cultural trends,"" Balich's since-deleted post said. ""And so Trump's unity-signaling Inaugural Address was quickly followed by a protest march of grumpy old women and their wives to which Susan B. Anthony would not have been welcome.""
Balich said he chose to delete the post because he ""didn't put it up with the idea of making people upset.""
Balich meant for the post to be taken as ""satire,"" and said it paled in comparison to the offensive things he saw at the Women's March.
""Is 'grumpy old women' as bad as (a sign saying) 'I'll spread my legs for any refugee,' 'F-Trump,' or pictures of women's personal parts?"" Balich asked.
""It was vulgar,"" he said. ""The whole thing was vulgar.""
Balich had thought he put the issue to bed when he deleted the post.
""I figure it's all over with,"" he said. ""I took it down.""
While he believed paid protesters were behind the calls to Mullets, Balich also doesn't think there was ever going to be an actual protest.
""I really don't believe there's an organized protest going to happen, but Mullets canceled my fundraiser,"" he said.
""It's their business,"" he said. ""They have the right to do whatever they want.""
Calls to Mullets went unanswered Thursday. The bar's voicemail was full and not accepting messages.
Balich said a local law firm has reached out to him about organizing another fundraiser.
""A law firm called me up and they're upset because it's against the First Amendment,"" said Balich, who questioned whether the threats of such protests might cross party lines.
""The question is,"" he said, ""who's next?"""

""We are running a clean campaign focusing on digital engagement,"" McCullagh said in a news release. ""It's proven effective and competitive against my opponent's multi-million dollar onslaught. I absolutely never violated the policies Facebook claims I did, and I believe this censorship should be considered as a form of election interference.""
With barely one week to go before the Nov. 3 election, McCullagh said his personal profile on Facebook ""was arbitrarily terminated without warning or previous suspensions. No explanations were given initially. Facebook stated the page was banned 'without possibility of being reversed,'"" McCullagh stated in his news release.
According to the Shorewood Republican, McCullagh's banned profile was linked to the campaign's advertising account and campaign page. Therefore, the ""disabling of his account has devastatingly disrupted the campaign's online presence. In an era where digital advertising has become increasingly important for reaching voters, this ban puts the McCullagh campaign at a distinct disadvantage heading into the final campaign stretch,"" he announced.
McCullagh said Facebook claims he violated their policies, but when pressed to provide evidence of the violation cited they were unable to do so for ""privacy"" reasons.
""McCullagh's ban comes at a time when other prominent conservatives have been frequent targets of Big Tech,"" his campaign announcement states. ""Earlier this week, Twitter and Facebook admitted they limited the sharing of a New York Post article which details the Biden family's corruption. Government officials ranking as high as White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany have faced punishment from the silicon valley for violating their constantly growing list of community guidelines.""
McCullagh and Cappel, who is a Joliet Township High School District 204 school board member, are competing to fill the vacancy created because Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant is not running for re-election. Cappel has been an elementary teacher in Joliet's District 86.
Bertino-Tarrant, the Shorewood area Democrat, is running for Will County Executive against Republican Nick Ficarello, a Manhattan area resident and retired Will County Sheriff's investigator."

Chapman posted a lengthy statement on Facebook reflecting on his 20 years of office. He also announced that he plans to run for a village board trustee instead.
""This decision did not come easy because the Village of Shorewood has, and will always be embedded deep within me,"" Chapman notified Shorewood residents. ""I appreciate your support over the past 20 years and want to thank you for keeping me in a position to serve you.
""That being said, I still want to serve you and stay involved in where Shorewood will go in the future. I also want to make sure that our 'home rule' status is never abused by future Village Boards. That is why I have decided to run for Village Trustee. I served in this position for my first 8 years on the Village Board, chairing Planning and Zoning, Citizens Advisory, Finance, Cable TV, Village Hall Expansion committees under Mayor Hofer. My experience and qualifications speak for themselves.""
Three days ago, Chapman posted a rant on his Facebook page that read in part: ""Now I am truly angry. I don't care what your politics are, that's your business. The last few nights I have been out getting signatures to run for the Village Board and have met many people.
""At least three elderly couples told me that they were afraid to display signs for any candidate. Their fear was based on their belief that their property could be damaged by people with opposing views. Apparently this is what we have degraded to.
""I have spent 28 years in service to this Village and this is the first time I have heard this. Fear to voice or show your opinion. Fear for your safety! Fear for your property! Because you might not agree with someone else. I want Shorewood to be a place where we all feel safe. Please respect each other, and don't impose your will on other people by making them fearful. If you are caught doing so, we in Shorewood will make certain you are held accountable. God bless you all during these trying times."""
