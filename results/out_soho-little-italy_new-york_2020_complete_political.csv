The Council voted unanimously to approve the project, with a lone abstention from a Brooklyn councilman.
The project, known as Haven Green, is expected to bring 123 apartments of low-income, LGBTQ-friendly senior housing to the Little Italy area — but will require razing the beloved Elizabeth Street Garden to the outrage of garden supporters.
""This collective effort is what we need when we talk about housing justice for all,"" said Councilmember Margaret Chin, a longtime supporter of the plan. The plan ""addresses both the urgent need of affordable housing and open space for the neighborhood.""
In a statement, she applauded seniors ""for not backing down in the face of a well-funded misinformation campaign that sought to tell us that now was not the time, and this was not the place for affordable housing.""
The new development will retain about 6,700 square feet of open space — which is just one-third of the existing garden. But Wednesday, Council Speaker Corey Johnson announced with Councilmember Margaret Chin a new plan to expand Haven Green's new open space into a 14,000-square-foot courtyard south of the garden at the Little Italy Restoration Apartments.
""Together, the two open spaces would be over 20,000 square feet,"" Johnson said. Additional details remain to be seen, but owners of those apartments, The DeMatteis Organization have signed a letter of intent, Johnson said. The change was first noted at a council committee meeting earlier this month, Bowery Boogie reported.
Opponents who want to save the entire garden have fought tooth-and-nail with Chin and the plan's developers, Habitat for Humanity New York City, Pennrose Properties and RiseBoro Community Partnership. Elizabeth Street Garden and Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden filed lawsuits to halt the project — and charge a better option would be to build housing at a separate empty lot to save the garden in its entirety.
""City Council members fulfill their reputation of deference, short of one who abstained, and vote in favor of destroying Elizabeth Street Garden,"" executive director of the Elizabeth Street Garden Joseph Reiver tweeted.
Karen Haycox, head of Habitat NYC, has repeatedly emphasized the need to bring low-income housing to wealthy neighborhoods.
""We are honored to be a part of a project and a team in building an ideal compromise that serves multiple community needs in one of our City's Most gentrified and expensive neighborhoods,"" Haycox said in a statement.
The new building will serve formerly homeless seniors and those earning up to about $42,000, overseen by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, according to the project developers.
Hundreds packed rooms at myriad contentious meetings in the past year. Fiery debates among neighbors made some feel as if open space and affordable housing advocates were pitted against each other.
The Council's approval vote is the last step of a lengthy review process, called the uniform land use review procedure, before heading to the mayor's office for approval."

Sorokin, also known as Anna Delvey, was sentenced to at least four years in prison with a maximum 12-year sentence, DA Cyrus Vance's office said.
She was also slapped with about $200,000 in restitution and a $24,000 fine for stealing more than $200,000 and attempting to steal millions, according to the DA's office.
In April, Sorokin, 28, was found guilty of all charges against her, including multiple counts of grand larceny and attempted grand larceny for her scams between November 2016 and August 2017.

The project — dubbed Haven Green — is expected to bring more than 100 units of deeply affordable, LGBTQ-friendly senior housing to the Little Italy area.
But in bringing low-income senior housing to the neighborhood, the garden will be slashed to about one-third of its current size — a point of outrage among some neighbors who strongly oppose the plan and have even sued to stop it.
At City Hall Thursday afternoon, dozens rallied on the steps of City Hall and testified at the hearing, which lasted beyond 5 p.m.
Haven Green supporters said the need for low-income senior housing is critical — noting some 200,000 seniors are on the wait list for affordable housing.
""It's punishing to grow old in this city,"" said K Webster, a strong supporter of Haven Green and Lower East Sider who has long been an advocate for seniors' rights.
For seniors of color, LGBTQ seniors, or other marginalized groups, ""it's brutal,"" she added.
""This is not an equivalent struggle. This is a shared compromise,"" Webster said.
The new development would create 123 affordable apartments affordable for seniors along with about 6,700 square feet of open space, as well as space for retail, community facilities and Habitat offices. Pennrose Properties, RiseBoro Community Partnership and Habitat for Humanity New York City are partners in the project, which the Department of Housing Preservation and Development is overseeing.
The apartments would be affordable to tenants earning 30 to 60 percent of the area median income, the equivalent of about $21,000 to $43,000 per year in 2018, Haven Green representatives said Thursday.
Karen Haycox, the head of Habitat for Humanity New York City, said the housing project is a ""matter of social, economic and racial justice.""
But Elizabeth Street Garden supporters said the garden is a needed ""oasis"" in the neighborhood. They want to save it in its entirety.
Elizabeth Street Garden ""has strong objections to and concerns about the Proposed Project and its impact on the local community,"" Normal Siegel and Kate Fletcher, attorneys for the garden, which has sued the city, said in a statement Thursday.
""To be clear, [Elizabeth Street Garden] is not opposed to developing affordable housing in the area, but ESG is opposed to the unnecessary destruction of Elizabeth Street Garden to accomplish that end,"" Siegel and Fletcher wrote.
The public hearing before the City Council's land use committee was among the final steps in a lengthy review process before the controversial project ultimately goes to vote in the full Council. Last month, the City Planning Commission approved the plan, with just one ask from the City Planning chair to extend the hours of the future open space beyond 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Councilwoman Margaret Chin, who holds a pivotal vote for the project under the public review process, has been a supporter of Haven Green and rallied with its supporters Thursday afternoon.
Seniors seeking affordable housing ""want to know when it will be ready,"" Chin said. ""Telling them that now is not the time and that this city-owned lot in not the place is unacceptable.""
""Fair and equitable housing call for all neighborhoods in our city to participate in alleviating this crisis,"" she added.
But other elected officials have backed the Elizabeth Street Garden supporters, including Assemblymembers Deborah Glick and Yuh-Line Niou.
Glick echoed the Community Board 2 resolution opposing the plan, calling for another site to be used for affordable housing instead.
Sacrificing community space instead of looking at a different empty site is a ""disservice to the community,"" Glick said."

4,/new-york/soho-little-italy/city-planning-approves-senior-housing-elizabeth-st-garden,2019-04-10T20:29:55Z,City Planning Approves Housing At Elizabeth Street,0,0,Sydney Pereira,Patch Staff,"LITTLE ITALY, NY — The City Planning Commission approved the affordable senior housing project at the Elizabeth Street Garden Wednesday, sending the project onward to a vote in City Council.
The go-ahead for the contentious low-income senior housing project came after dozens testified for and against the Haven Green project, which would build 123 units of affordable LGBTQ-friendly senior housing but slash the beloved Elizabeth Street Garden to about one-third of its current size.
""In a neighborhood that has so few undeveloped parcels, every piece of land has the potential to meet multiple, and at times, competing neighborhood needs,"" City Planning Chair Marisa Lago said in a 'yes' vote on Wednesday. ""In a neighborhood with an area median income as high as this one, the search for land on which to construct affordable housing is especially challenging.""
Lago urged the Haven Green project leads to extend the hours of the future green space beyond 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., as previously proposed.
""Even on an early spring day like today, it's evidence that those hours are far too short and we expect to see longer hours,"" Lago said.
Garden-supporters have long-opposed the project and advocated for saving the 20,000-square-foot garden in its entirety and building on a separate nearby lot instead — resulting in lawsuits and neighbors often feeling pitted against one another. But affordable housing advocates have contended the neighborhood needs additional low-income housing, plus, about 6,700 square feet of green space would remain on the site.
Twelve commissioners voted yes on Haven Green for the affordable housing project, with Commissioner Orlando Marin recusing himself.
Commissioner Michelle de la Uz said, ""It's really important that the city take opportunities such as this to affirmatively further fair housing in communities where we've seen dramatic shifts racially and socio-economically.""
The Haven Green development team was grateful for the approval vote.
""Since the project's conception, we have been focused on ensuring an inclusive process that supports the city's growing need of deeply affordable, LGBTQ-friendly, senior housing while also providing the public with high-quality open and accessible green space for generations to come,"" the team said in a statement. ""We look forward to continuing to move Haven Green forward and we thank all the members of the community that continue to support the project along the way""
City Planning's approval now sends the project to a vote in City Council, where Councilwoman Margaret Chin, who supports the project, holds a pivotal vote on Haven Green, which is being led by Habitat for Humanity New York City, Pennrose Properties, RiseBoro Community Partnership and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
In Chin's statement at the City Planning public hearing last month, she said, ""Since taking office, and for decades before that as a community activist, I have fought for affordable housing for people who desperately need it.""
""Opponents of this project hold a passionate point of view regarding the future of this site. It pains me to disagree with them, especially when I know that we all want what is best for our community,"" she said."
5,/new-york/soho-little-italy/city-holds-hearing-housing-project-elizabeth-st-garden,2019-03-13T20:06:34Z,City Holds Hearing On Elizabeth St. Garden Project,0,0,Sydney Pereira,Patch Staff,"LITTLE ITALY, NY — Supporters and opponents of a heated project to build affordable senior housing on the Elizabeth Street Garden were out in full force at the Department of City Planning's public hearing regarding the project on Wednesday.
The project, dubbed Haven Green, would build 123-units of affordable LGBTQ-friendly senior housing but slash the garden to about one-third of its current size.
Garden-supporters have long-opposed the project and advocated for saving the 20,000-square-foot garden in its entirety as a much needed open space for the neighborhood— though affordable housing and homeless advocates have fired back, saying Haven Green's low-income units are a necessity in ""high-opportunity"" neighborhoods like SoHo and Little Italy. The fiery debate has recently sparked two lawsuits against the city on the grounds the project requires a heftier environmental review than the one that was conducted.
At City Planning's hearing on Wednesday, dozens testified for and against the Haven Green project — many lamenting how the fight for green space and affordable housing has pitted communities against each other.
""Low-income people are simply locked out of the Little Italy community,"" said Steve Herrick, the president of housing organization Cooper Square Committee. ""Thousands of seniors in Community Board 2 are on senior housing waiting lists.""
In partnership with Pennrose Properties and RiseBoro Community Partnership, Habitat for Humanity's project would build 123 low-income studios for seniors, 6,700 square feet of green space, 4,000 square feet of commercial space and 11,000 square feet for community facilities and Habitat's offices. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development is overseeing the project.
Borough President Gale Brewer has recommended approval for the project — but is pushing the project leads to increase the open space by about 30 percent.
""There is a need for affordable housing, especially for low-income seniors and people who are homeless, and I think Haven Green does address some of those challenges,"" Brewer said.
Representatives for the two groups suing the city — Elizabeth Street Garden and a separate non-profit Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden — reiterated their legal arguments against the project. They raised concerns that the project is being proposed through the urban development action area program on the grounds the garden is ""blighted,"" since it is vacant.
""The proposal raises serious legal problems,"" said a woman who was testifying on behalf of the attorney for the Friends' group, Michael Gruen. ""The idea of treating vacancy of a park as synonymous with blight is patently absurd.""
Garden-supporters argued for a separate city-owned lot at 388 Hudson St. to be used for affordable housing instead. Jeannine Kiely, head of the Friends' non-profit, and Joseph Reiver, head of Elizabeth Street Garden, have repeatedly insisted a ""swap"" with that lot would be a win-win for the community.
Reiver previously told Patch, ""This is something that can be solved with the alternative site. That solution really achieves more affordable housing and more green space, and it doesn't pit these two communities against each other.""
Ben Carlos Thypin of Open New York, however, said with so many in need of affordable housing, both lots should be built upon.
""If you can't get behind a project like this, what project can you get behind?"" he said. ""How many homeless seniors will freeze on days like this while your futile and self indulgent lawsuit winds their way through the courts?""
The project is in the midst of a public review that will ultimately end at City Council, where Councilmember Margaret Chin, holds a pivotal vote.
""Since taking office, and for decades before that as a community activist, I have fought for affordable housing for people who desperately need it,"" Chin said in a statement supporting Haven Green on Wednesday. She lauded the project for reserving 30 percent of units for formerly homeless seniors and emphasized Services & Advocacy for LGBT Seniors will be working with Habitat to ensure seniors have LGBT programming and services in the building.
""If built, Haven Green will be only the third project in New York City modeled for a growing number of Stonewall veterans who increasingly face a perilous choice between safe housing and going back into the closet,"" Chin said. ""Opponents of this project hold a passionate point of view regarding the future of this site. It pains me to disagree with them, especially when I know that we all want what is best for our community."""
6,/new-york/soho-little-italy/brewer-oks-affordable-senior-housing-elizabeth-street-garden,2019-02-27T22:51:17Z,Brewer OK's Senior Housing At Elizabeth St. Garden,0,0,Sydney Pereira,Patch Staff,"LITTLE ITALY, NY — Borough President Gale Brewer recommended approval of Habitat for Humanity's 7-story affordable senior housing project, Haven Green, at the existing site of Elizabeth Street Garden on Tuesday.
The project, years in the making, will require razing the Elizabeth Street Garden to the outrage of many locals.
In partnership with Pennrose Properties and RiseBoro Community Partnership, Habitat will replace the garden with 123 units of low-income senior housing with some set aside for formerly homeless individuals. The open space on the site would be around one-quarter of the existing Elizabeth Street Garden.
Brewer's approval, which is advisory, had a few additional recommendations for the project leads, including increasing open space by about 30 percent — from 6,700 to over 8,000 square feet.
But, Brewer wrote: ""This should be done in a way that does not compromise the number of affordable units currently planned for the site and does not require breaking the height cap of the special district.""
""This may impact other uses and programming in the building, but must be considered as the need for open space in this area is critical,"" Brewer wrote.
Under the current plans, the units will be for tenants earning below 60 percent of area median income, which is currently $43,000 for one person, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development's AMI stats.
Thirty-seven units will be for formerly homeless individuals earning less than $22,000 a year.
An additional 4,000 square feet of the site will have commercial space and 11,000 square feet for community facilities and Habitat's offices.
Brewer also recommended ensuring the permanent affordability of the housing units, requiring community facility space to provide services in perpetuity, working out a formal agreement with the Parks Department to map the open space as parkland, and continuing community engagement.
Non-profit groups, including Elizabeth Street Garden and Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden, have been readying to sue over the project.
Friends' president Jeannine Kiely said to ""stay-tuned"" for a lawsuit soon on Wednesday.
""We're trying to save the entire garden,"" said Kiely, also a Community Board 2 member. ""Friends of the Elizabeth Street Garden met with the Borough President a couple of weeks ago, and these recommendations are not a surprise.""
The Friends group supports CB 2's resolution, which disapproved the Haven Green project in January and instead supported building affordable housing at a separate site at 388 Hudson St. where another city-owned empty lot is located — so long as the garden is untouched.
""I think the garden is an absolutely fabulous place,"" said Michael Gruen, Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden's lawyer. ""It is a difficult problem to have to decide between a magnificent garden and housing for people who need it badly. But I think on that, one should try as best one possibly can to find a site that is more amenable to such housing and this is not, from my clients' point of view, a NIMBY [or Not-In-My-Backyard] matter.""
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which is overseeing the project, has previously said if the site could be used at this time, both are being eyed for additional affordable housing to mitigate the city's affordability crisis. In 2016, Politico reported that over 100,000 people ages 62 and older were waiting an average of seven years for affordable apartments — an oft cited statistic for Haven Green project supporters.
The project is making its way through the uniform land use review procedure, which will end with City Council having a final vote in the coming months."

Neighbors can learn more about the neighborhood's usage and provide their feedback at the second public meeting this Thursday.
The meeting, scheduled for 6 p.m. at 1 Centre St. in the North Wing Mezzanine, will be an opportunity for stakeholders to discuss their ideas about the neighborhood's issues related to retail, office space, the creative industries, and quality of life, the Department of City Planning announced. The meeting is titled ""Mixed-Use SoHo/NoHo: Defining Mixed-Use.""
""This meeting is an important opportunity for those who live, work or visit the SoHo NoHo neighborhoods to provide their vision of how they'd like to see these neighborhoods evolve in the years ahead,"" Borough President Gale Brewer said in a statement.
Thursday's meeting schedule is as follows:
Earlier this month, the first meeting regarding the possible rezoning initiative was flooded with people — over 250, according to the city. The room was overcrowded and city unprepared for residents curious what the city's plans were for the neighborhood during the chaotic meeting.
Brewer, Chin, and City Planning later apologized and reiterated the purpose of the meetings is to hear from the community about what ""challenges"" exist before any proposals are written.
The city's summary of input from attendees can be seen here.
Lago said in a statement: ""These workshops are excellent opportunities for all in the community — long-time residents, recent arrivals, artists, business owners and workers — to take a deep dive into the unique challenges and opportunities facing SoHo and NoHo.""
Existing zoning regulations in the neighborhoods from the 1970s have required special permits to legalize retail and residential uses to balance the neighborhood's historic context as a manufacturing district.
Landlords have formed the Fix SoHo NoHo Coalition to advocate for changes in the status quo of land use in the neighborhood, Crains reported. Neighborhood group SoHo Alliance's director Sean Sweeney argues for better enforcement over a rezoning, particularly the ""over-sized"" retail stores, often taking up well over 10,000 square feet of space, which some community members and politicians have said violates existing zoning through loopholes.
""SoHo and NoHo became the economic and artistic hubs they are today thanks to the mixed-use nature of these two areas,"" Chin said in a statement. ""The next engagement session seeks to create a space for long-time residents, workers and visitors to share how the City can preserve the unique character of theses communities.""

Borough President Gale Brewer, Councilmember Margaret Chin and the Department of City Planning said sorry Tuesday.
Last week, dozens flooded to the meeting that kick-started the Department of City Planning's public process for a possible rezoning of the neighborhoods.
""We apologize for being unprepared for the tremendous turnout — over 250 people attended,"" a letter from Brewer and the other officias said. ""We'll do better for the next meeting in February.""
The open letter touted a silver-lining that the high turnout garnered significant feedback on ""where our planning process should start and what the community wants us to focus on.""
The city counted 211 written comments, 109 ""locations of interest"" pinned on maps and 94 responses to the neighborhoods' informative poster boards.
""Staff and our moderator from Pratt, Jonathan Martin, are digesting all the feedback — which will inform the process and future public meetings,"" the letter said.
""To be clear, the intent of the Soho/Noho planning process is to collaborate with all those who care about the challenges our neighborhoods face, and the purpose of our public meetings is to gather ideas and input well before pen is put to paper and proposals are created.""
The neighborhood is composed of high-end lofts and retail outlets, the latter which have often been considered ""over-sized,"" an issue that has long-angered SoHo residents and small business owners. Much of the ground-floor retail and apartments have been permitted through grandfathering clauses or special permits since the existing '70s zoning mark the neighborhood largely for manufacturing.

Much like a typical community engagement meeting, the open house held on Wednesday night featured large poster boards about the neighborhood, opportunities to write personal feedback on note-cards for planners to read and myriad city planners on-hand to discuss what people like and don't like about the neighborhood. Even City Planning Chair Marisa Lago attended.
But a lack of adequate seating, no formal presentation and no microphone for people to hear caused the meeting to erupt in chaos.
Dozens huddled around Pratt Institute and Columbia University city planning professor Jonathan Martin, who attempted to explain the six-month public process.
""To remove the confusion, what we are doing here tonight is beginning a six-month process of community outreach on recommendations to improve SoHo and NoHo,"" said Martin, who is also a city planning consultant with BFJ Planning.
Attendees grumbled, asking, ""how can we trust this process?"" and ""is your assumption that it needs to be improved?"" and ""how much are you getting paid by the real estate industry?""
Others shouted out criticisms of the Real Estate Board of New York and Councilmember Margaret Chin — who is often mis-trusted by some constituents in this neighborhood because of her support for the contested plan to build affordable housing for elderly seniors and on site of the beloved Elizabeth Street Garden.
Last month, Borough President Gale Brewer, Chin and the Department of City Planning announced the beginning of the possible rezoning. Existing regulations set in the '70s mark the neighborhood largely for manufacturing uses.
But now the neighborhood includes high-end lofts and retail outlets — and the latter are often considered ""over-sized"" – an issue that has long-angered SoHo residents and small business owners. Much of the ground-floor retail and apartments have been permitted through grandfathering clauses or special permits.
""We need to hear from you,"" Chin told the crowd. ""This is where you have to raise your voice. ... We are facilitating this process.""
""Instead of letting us find out what are our shared concerns and giving voice to these concerns, they are saying you as an individual go on the side and fill out a form,"" said Shlomo ""Solly"" Angel, a New York University city planning professor and SoHo resident.
Martin ""telling us that he's working for us has no weight at all,"" Angel said, noting he wouldn't support massive lifting of restrictions in a rezoning but, rather, believes in ""re-regulation.""
""I'm against just opening it up for developers to just come and do whatever they want,"" he said.
Others from the group Open New York attended the meeting in support of a rezoning, so long as it would increase density to build more housing.
""In this environment, we need every bit of housing we can muster, but that won't be possible if we don't zone for it,"" East Villager Will Thomas of Open New York wrote in prepared remarks, thinking the meeting would be organized for attendees to speak.
After a series of more public workshops in the coming months, a recommendation report is expected to be released this summer.

The Department of City Planning will begin the process — which ultimately may lead to a rezoning of the neighborhoods — on Feb. 6, city officials said. Topics discussed during the meetings will include housing, jobs, retail and creative industries.
The planning initiative is being led by the Department of City Planning, Borough President Gale Brewer and local City Councilmember Margaret Chin. Zoning regulations for SoHo passed in the 1970s present ""challenges to the continued vitality of the neighborhoods,"" according to a city press release.
""The SoHo / NoHo area has a rich, vibrant history, but we need to fix its zoning to lay the foundation for its future,"" Brewer said in a statement. ""As the old rules have stopped working, the area has seen a steady march of special exemptions, one-off variances, and inappropriately large retail uses.""
Much of SoHo was zoned for manufacturing uses in the '70s in order to protect a declining manufacturing sector in the face of neighborhood change. These days, SoHo is associated with high-end lofts and luxury retail corridors.
The neighborhood's industrial zoning technically does not allow for ground-floor retail and apartments. Such uses have been grandfathered in or granted through special permits, but neighborhood-wide zoning changes would allow more as-of-right uses.
""Every neighborhood in our city is unique – but none more so than SoHo and NoHo. These neighborhoods share a long, fascinating history of being filled with manufacturers, artists, residents, offices, shops and restaurants, all along charming historic streets,"" DCP Director Mariso Lago said in a statement.
""But, like all neighborhoods, SoHo and NoHo face unique challenges, not the least of which is outdated zoning.""
After six months of public outreach, the city will draft a report that is expected to be released during the summer, city officials said. The city is working with a number of neighborhood stakeholders such as the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, the SoHo Alliance, local community boards and neighborhood educational and political institutions.
The city's press release did not disclose where the Feb. 6 meeting will be held.

MTA officials said in a statement sent to Patch just after noon Tuesday that a southbound F train became ""unable to take power"" (LOL) around 6:20 p.m. the night before, a little ways north of the Broadway-Lafayette Street subway station in SoHo, Manhattan.

The ensuing ordeal lasted 45 minutes total, officials said, and passengers aboard the ""incident train"" (LOL) were informed within 10 minutes of the train losing power that there had been a ""mechanical issue.""
MTA officials said an initial review showed ""the rail control center and service supervisor responded promptly to this problem."" However, they also admitted that in general, they ""need to continue the push to minimize both the frequency and the duration of system failures and delays."" (""That is the goal of the six-point plan announced last month,"" they added. Although given their track record with points and plans and things, it seems the $1 million ""genius"" award for outside ideas might end up being a tad more fruitful.)
What do you think? Buyin' what they're sellin'? Let us know: simone.wilson@patch.com.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, meanwhile, who's in charge of the MTA, hadn't said a word by Tuesday afternoon about the previous night's sweaty, panicked horror show aboard one of his deadbeat NYC subway trains — among around 750 other cars reportedly well past their 40-year functional life span.
Cuomo did, however, have time to announce in a 1,181-word press release Tuesday that the Woodstock Festival site in Bethel, NY, has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.
""Woodstock was a pivotal moment in both New York and American history, bringing together the unique art and music in an event that changed this nation's cultural and political landscape,"" the governor said. ""This prestigious recognition will help preserve a priceless New York landmark for current and future generations of New Yorkers.""
Anyway. Here's what passengers say happened to them in an F train tunnel beneath Lower Manhattan on Monday night. And here's the MTA's narrative in full:

The 30,000-square-foot facility will focus on solutions within the biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and consumer health sectors. The collaboration arrives after the Cuomo administration's $650 million initiative to improve biotechnology in New York.
In addition to offering laboratory facilities to biotech-oriented startups, JLABS aims to connect local entrepreneurs to Johnson & Johnson Innovation where they can benefit from the institution's robust monetary assistance and in-depth insight from medical experts and various informational events, Johnson & Johnson said in a press release.
In spite of hosting over 100 research foundations and nine medical centers, New York City continues to face a dearth in solid infrastructure to support entrepreneurs in life sciences. JLABS @ NYC aims to bridge that gap between institutional support and local innovation with the help of its facilities and technology.
""New York is poised to be a global leader in this industry, and the new, vital incubator JLABS will be the catalyst that pushes our state into the forefront of this exciting field,"" said Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The ""Spotlight""-star and environmental activist (Ruffalo was an outspoken protester of the Dakota Access pipeline) will be joined by fellow actor Steve Buscemi.
Tickets for the Wednesday night fundraiser start at $100, with donors who give $1,000 gaining access to a VIP Reception, according to the New York Daily News.
""Some of the most powerful interests in New York City have already spent almost $13 million to try and defeat Bill,"" the de Blasio campaign wrote in an email signed by Ruffalo, according to the blog State of Politics.
""But he is funding his re-election campaign a different way, with the vast majority of contributions coming from New Yorkers giving small amounts of money — many of them coming at events like the one on January 11.""
De Blasio is running for a second term as mayor of New York City this year. Several Democrats have already filed to run against him in the primary, including New York state Sen. Tony Avella and former City Councilman Sal Albanese.

14,/new-york/soho-little-italy/are-people-avoiding-trumps-soho-hotel,2016-12-23T14:25:41Z,Are People Avoiding Trump's Soho Hotel?,0,0,Sarah Beller,Patch Staff,"SOHO, NY — Kanye's recent meeting with Donald Trump at his Midtown Manhattan headquarters apparently hasn't done much to boost the president-elect's popularity in NYC.
A local paparazzo recently told neighborhood news blog The Villager that celebs have been avoiding Trump Soho, the magnate's hotel at 246 Spring St.
No one famous has been seen there since April, the paparazzo said.
""Almost nobody has stayed there for the last six months at least,"" he told the Villager. ""Most A-listers now stay at the Greenwich Hotel owned by [Robert] De Niro, or the Bowery Hotel or the Mercer Hotel, some Uptown at the Ritz [Carlton] or London [NYC]. It's possible some celebs are staying [at the Trump Soho], but not the usual numbers who were before.""
Perhaps stars are following the lead of Lebron James, who made headlines earlier this month when he refused to stay at Trump Soho while the Cavs were in New York, even though his team has a contract with the hotel.
Travel site Hipmunk has compiled data on how Trump properties around the country are doing. According to their findings, bookings at the Trump Soho hotel among their users were down 74 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, and down 70 percent in the second quarter. (The site doesn't have information up yet for Q3 or Q4, which would show any post-election impact.)
Trump Soho did not immediately return a request for comment.
Earlier this week, though, the hotel tweeted to thank Time Out New York for ""listing our spa as a top one to visit in NYC; we agree!""
A sign of desperation?
