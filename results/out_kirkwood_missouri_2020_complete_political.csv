That's why at Social Security, we are constantly improving our online resources to make doing business with us easier and faster.
With a my Social Security account, those receiving benefits can change their address and direct deposit information; get proof of their benefits; and request replacement documents, like a Medicare card. If you aren't currently getting benefits, you can check your earnings record, get estimates of your future benefits, and view your Social Security Statement. In many states, you can even request a replacement Social Security card online. See everything you can do with a my Social Security account and open one today at www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount."

Both programs help safeguard millions of Americans as well as improve the quality of life for their family and friends. While Social Security offers retirement, disability, and survivors benefits, Medicare provides health insurance.
Medicare is our country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older and younger people receiving Social Security disability benefits. The program helps with the cost of health care, but it doesn't cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care.
When you first enroll in Medicare and during certain times of the year, you can choose how you get your Medicare coverage. There are 2 main ways to get Medicare:
Original Medicare
Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). If you want drug coverage, you can join a separate Part D plan. To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medicare (like your deductible and 20% coinsurance), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage. Examples include coverage from a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy, or from a former employer or union.
Medicare Advantage (also known as Part C)

Medicare Advantage is an ""all in one"" alternative to Original Medicare. These ""bundled"" plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. Part C plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. They also may offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover — like vision, hearing, dental, and more.
If you can't afford to pay your Medicare premiums and other medical costs, you may be able to get help from your state. States offer programs for people eligible for or entitled to Medicare who have low income. Some programs may pay for Medicare premiums and some pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance. To qualify, you must have limited income and resources."

Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per week—or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data set—Iowa—and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

The U.S. Census Bureau has the answer, at least relating to 15 different languages ranging from Spanish (the most common, besides English, in this area) to Arabic (more heavily clustered in South City and South County).

According to the 
bureau's website
, ""the 
2011 Language Mapper
 shows where people speaking specific languages other than English live, with dots representing how many people speak each of 15 different languages. For each language, the mapper shows the concentration of those who report that they speak English less than 'very well,' a measure of English proficiency.""

The map shows data from the American Community Survey from 2007 to 2011.

We've embedded an interactive version of the map. Some of the tools fill much of the screen, and you can drag those screens to the side of the mini-window after selecting the language you want to highlight. You can also click and drag the map around inside the mini-window to see different parts of the region.

The maps we've highlighted on this article show the concentration of speakers of Spanish, German, French, Arabic, Chinese and Russian — and only the ones who said they speak English ""less than very well."" These seemed to be the languages with the heaviest concentrations in the St. Louis area among the 15 languages the Census tracks.

The interactive map will show you the concentration of ALL speakers of a language — including those who speak English well."

Jay Nixon stopped by Greentree Pharmacy in Kirkwood Monday for a press conference about his veto of tax-related House Bill 253.

Nixon said the bill includes a $200 million/year tax increase on prescription drugs, sourcing that as his primary reason for vetoing the bill in June.

The tax-relief bill was passed by General Assembly in the 2013 legislative session and will be back in for review during the veto session next month.

""I think the vast majority of folks [in the House] did not see that this increase was in there,"" Nixon said.

See more of Gov. Nixon's comments in the video above.

The office of Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Glendale, sent a press release after Nixon's press conference Monday requesting a veto override.

""The language at issue was provided by the governor's administration and included some conflicting language and deletions,"" Rep. Rick Stream, R-Kirkwood said in the release. ""However, that section of the bill does not go into effect until 2015. That issue will be dealt with swiftly and clarified next session in a bipartisan way. It is a red herring, and the governor's argument is intellectually dishonest.""

The veto session is scheduled for Sept. 11. A two-thirds majority vote is needed to override a vetoed item.

The Nixon administration says the expansion would help 300,000 Missourians who currently don't have health insurance, and would protect against cuts in federal reimbursements to hospitals which treat the uninsured.
Opponents in the state legislature say Medicaid is a program that needs fixing, not expansion.

October 7, 2020
The City of Kirkwood is proud to announce that Council-member Maggie Duwe has been selected to join an inaugural cohort of 21 local elected officials in a new initiative designed to equip them to effectively advocate for and support safer and more complete streets.
Over the course of six months, these leaders will receive comprehensive training to help them become champions for promoting activity-friendly routes to everyday destinations in their communities.
Complete Streets are a vital solution for stemming the rising tide of pedestrian havoc on American streets, which has been getting worse during the COVID-19 crisis. Nationally, driving has decreased 17 percent in the first six months of 2020, but the roadway fatality rate increased by 20 percent. Fewer people are driving but more people are being killed.

Why is this? For one, as the roadways have emptied, speeding has increased by a great amount—a logical outcome when roads are designed primarily for speed, which has deadly consequences. Communities of all sizes urgently need to find ways to prioritize people when it comes to designing and building streets in order to give everyone an option for staying active and healthy while getting where they need to go safely and conveniently each day.
The 21 leaders selected, represent 14 different states and places of almost every size. Over a 6 month period they will learn how Complete Streets can help their communities address multiple crises at the same time, among other vital lessons. Safer streets that anyone can use provide more space for socially distanced and affordable transportation options during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. They can help us reduce emissions and fight climate change by making it possible for more people to walk, bike, or take transit. They can save thousands of lives each year by reducing the growing number of people who are struck and killed while walking on dangerous roads. And they can help us create more equitable public spaces by ensuring that people of all ages and abilities can access our streets.
These participants will become champions for developing and advocating for equitable and effective Complete Streets policies that will make safer street design the rule instead of the exception. In a community that's already passed a Complete Streets policy, these local leaders will be able to focus on making sure it's actually implemented—and potentially strengthening the local policy if needed.
