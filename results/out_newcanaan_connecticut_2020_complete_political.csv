By ""small group,"" Moynihan said five or fewer people, and masks should still be worn if social distancing cannot be maintained.
The fields will be monitored from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday to ensure that people are obeying social distancing protocols.
The move to open the fields comes as the town and the state slowly began to reopen, with stores and restaurants beginning to serve customers again (outdoors) this week.
Additionally, with Memorial Day on Monday, the town has produced a video ceremony in honor of veterans that can be seen on the town's YouTube channel or at 10 a.m. on Channel 79 on Monday.
Below is Moynihan's full Friday announcement and coronavirus update:

Good evening.
This is First Selectman Kevin Moynihan with a coronavirus update.
The re-opening of Downtown retail stores on Wednesday and restaurants for outdoor dining today has gone well, and we are glad to be on track with Governor Lamont's plan to re-open our CT economy in measured steps safely. I encourage you to call your favorite restaurant and make a reservation for this weekend. Please remember that Downtown on Main and Elm, Forest and Pine Streets is a facecovering-required zone when the walkways are busy and you cannot maintain social distancing from other pedestrians or diners. It will take all of us to do our part to make diners and shoppers feel safe.
As Mike Handler mentioned on his outcalls this week, the Town has begun to implement a broad-based community testing program. We have tested nearly 350 first responders, volunteers and Town employees and I'm pleased to report that we have not detected any new active cases of the
coronavirus. Voluntary testing of residents will begin next Wednesday and we will be sharing detailed instructions soon. To get tested you will need to provide insurance information and the name of your primary care physician. Anyone who is uninsured can request to be covered by Government funding.
I am also pleased to announce that this Sunday we will re-open the Water Tower turf fields at Waveny Park to individual and small group recreational activities. There will be monitors on duty from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm to maintain orderly recreation with proper social distancing and groups of less than 5 persons – no team or organized group activity will be permitted. I urge all of you to be courteous and avoid coming into close contact with others without having a face covering pulled over your mouth and nose.
Finally, I want to wish all of you an enjoyable Memorial Day Weekend at home. Unfortunately, we will not be able to see each other on Main Street for our traditional Memorial Day parade. However, we recorded a Memorial Day Ceremony at Lakeview Cemetery with VFW Post 653 for broadcast on Monday morning at 10:00 am on Channel 79. You will also be able to view it on the YouTube link at the top of the homepage of our website at newcanaan.info.
Thank you.

2,/connecticut/newcanaan/letter-editor-new-canaans-strong-financial-position,2020-05-20T21:00:10Z,Letter To The Editor: New Canaan Is Fiscally Sound,0,0,Alfred Branch,Patch Staff,"To the Editor:
As the Board of Finance does each year, this is an update on our current budget and tax projections as we close out our 2019/2020 budget on June 30th as well as an overview of our new 2020/2021 budget that begins on July 1st.
As always, and especially this year, I can never thank our volunteers across the town, our town employees, our volunteers on many Boards and Commissions, our Town Council, our Board of Education, and our First Selectman enough – they make an incredible effort on our behalf in order to keep our town in great shape in every way. And while that is always true, the past 100 days have truly stressed the system. But our town response has been overwhelmingly positive, from our schools, our residents, the donations people have made, and all the volunteer help across the town. An extra grateful thank you to the volunteers and healthcare workers who have gone above and beyond to support our community and our region.
The fiscal year that we are closing in June will show back-to-back years of below budget spending, and declining debt. We will also require less tax income from our taxpayers for the second year in a row. We believe that this is a first. Our mill rate will also slightly decline to 18.16. The mill rates of Wilton (28.5), Ridgefield (28.1), and Weston (32.3) are considerably higher. The Route 1 coastal towns of Westport (16.9) and Darien (16.5) have lower mill rates driven by the much higher commercial revenue tax base of the Route 1 businesses, and higher total grand list values.
Through careful spending and planning, we are fortunate to be able to keep taxes from rising, while not cutting any existing school programs, sports, arts, teachers, police, or fire as many districts have been forced to do across Connecticut. This isn't an easy thing to do with the many demands we have each year for more spending, including contractual annual cost increases. No other town in Fairfield County asked their taxpayers to pay less in total taxation in back to back years while delivering below budget spending two years in a row.
Our single largest expense every year is for Education, representing approximately 62% of our total budget. Nearly 70% of our budget this year will be spent on Education, Police, and Fire. The remaining 30% is spent on roads, building maintenance, town employees, pension expense, Public Works, health care, and debt service.
Regarding debt, over the past 25 years we have borrowed approximately $140M for school renovations and improvements, $20M to purchase Irwin Park, as supported by a town-wide referendum, and $18M for the Town Hall renovation project. We also borrow much smaller amounts each year for building maintenance and road repairs. And we pay down our debt every year on a straight-line basis. Our long-term debt was $127M in 2011. Our town's debt today is $107M. We project that our debt will trend down towards $100M for the first time in 20 years by the end of this calendar year.
But keep our debt in perspective. The combined income of the residents of New Canaan was $2.4B as reported by the State of Connecticut. The total grand list is valued at $7.7B. So $100M of debt represents approximately 4% of our income and 1.3% of our assets. Our debt level is by no means a problem. We will continue to borrow strategically and prudently, leveraging historically low rates for road and building repairs. And we have saved several million dollars of interest expense on our debt over the past three years through refinancing, again driven by low rates and the favorable Aaa bond rating that our town has earned and kept. We want to reduce our annual debt expense as a means of lowering overall town expenses.
It is our expectation that we will continue to evaluate the sale and divestment of certain town-owned assets. Today, those assets cost money to repair and maintain and don't provide tax revenue to the town. As I said in my update last year, if we divest certain properties and assets, we will be able to avoid continued repair costs, use the proceeds to reduce debt if needed, fund other investments, or lower taxes, while adding to our Grand List value as well as property tax revenue. A win win win. We are also evaluating our long-term capital plan to continue to enhance the assets in our town for the next several decades. Our schools, police station, and library will be among the top areas to invest in over the next decade.
From a Board of Finance perspective, our top priorities continue as before: one, our schools must continue the long, multi-decade tradition of being a leading district in Connecticut. Two, we must continue to provide a beautiful downtown, with surrounding parks, activities, and programs throughout the town. Three, we need to continue to provide safety and emergency services for our residents and visitors. Four, we need to maintain financial strength as a town, while enhancing, improving, or renewing our town assets to continuously improve the services and support that our residents expect. In short, provide excellent value while helping New Canaan succeed financially in good times and bad.
Going forward into the new fiscal year, working with the Board of Selectman, Town Council, the Board of Education, and all the other town departments, we will continue to look for ways to spend less. The Board of Finance worked very closely with the Board of Selectman, the Town Council, the Board of Education, and the other departments and organizations across New Canaan during the budget process right as the Covid-19 crisis unfolded. The current crisis reminds us to challenge our spending and borrowing assumptions. We will continue to be prudent in the coming year.
In summary, our Bond rating continues to be Aaa. Our town pensions are fully funded at 105% as of March 30th. Our overall spending this year is projected to be $2.2M below budget, and our debt decreased this year. Our rainy-day, unassigned fund balance maintains an appropriate amount to handle shocks to the system like we are seeing right now. As a benchmark, we hold the equivalent of 15-18% of our annual budget in our unassigned general fund for risk management. Most towns that we compare ourselves with hold 8-14%. Bond agencies want to see at least 10% of the town's annual budget in an unassigned fund to take advantage of the most favorable rates. We ran surpluses in the fiscal years ending in 2018 and 2019 that increased this fund as we spent less than we budgeted, and had more revenue than we planned. For our 2020/2021 budget we are planning to use $4.5M from this fund to offset town expenses. This will reduce the demand for taxes by the same amount. We budgeted similar offsets in prior years but have been able to avoid drawing them down due to reduced spending and increased revenue. For the period of March through June, the town will see less revenue from parking permits, conveyance fees, and other revenue sources. Our fund balance will absorb these shortfalls without adding taxes, but also limits how much we can now contribute.
We certainly need a healthy reserve fund to protect taxpayers from unforeseen shocks and costs, and to maintain our financial strength. However, the Board of Finance believes that we should offset $4.5M of expenses from funds that have built up over time and give it back to the taxpayers at a time like this. This will reduce the burden on our taxpayers while maintaining 'dry powder' to help address future risks.

Established by a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress in 1962, National Police Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and protection of others.
In 2019, across our nation, 87 officers died in the line of duty. We must honor these men and women.
Today, we honor two New Canaan Officers whom died in the line of duty:
Louis Drucker died on January 25, 1888 after being shot in the chest by a bootlegger when responding to a complaint of illegal alcohol sales at a Seminary Street home.
James Martin died on July 24, 1991, during a fierce storm, after coming in contact with a downed electrical wire while responding to a stranded motorist with trees down call on Valley Road.
We honor our officer's ultimate sacrifice and express our sincere condolences to their grieving families, friends, fellow officers and loved ones. These men, as well as all our fallen brothers and sisters in law enforcement, left behind families and friends who will forever carry the ache of loss and grief which accompanies a life lost in its prime.
Police Officers are ordinary people who are at times required to exhibit extraordinary courage in the pursuit of their mission to safeguard the lives of the citizens they serve.
May we never forget!

Gov. Ned Lamont has said that restaurants can reopen on May 20 for outdoor dining only, and Moynihan hopes that restaurants will offer a special hour or two for older residents, similar to what many grocery stores did around the state.
""Perhaps during lunchtime,"" Moynihan said on Thursday to a group of reporters during a press conference on Zoom.
Moynihan and other town officials are working with an informal group led by New Canaan Chamber of Commerce Director Tucker Murphy on how New Canaan should handle reopening, with an eye toward helping the downtown area survive. (Don't miss local and statewide news about coronavirus developments and precautions. Sign up for Patch alerts and daily newsletters.)
""There are a lot of residents who want to help the downtown area survive, the shops, the restaurants,"" Moynihan said.
The Department of Public Works is working on a plan for the sidewalks to allow restaurants to put tables outside, and the town plans to close parallel parking on Elm Street temporarily to turn it into a pedestrian walkway, according to the First Selectman.
Also, retail stores will be given disposal masks for their customers to wear inside the store.
Mike Handler, New Canaan's director of Emergency Management, said that the steps alone will not be enough.
""As we prepare to reopen businesses in a measured way, our success will be heavily dependent on our collective behavior,"" Handler said. ""If we wish to continue easing restrictions that are in place for our safety, then we must follow the guidelines and rules in place. This includes wearing face coverings, washing our hands and maintaining social distancing."""

In addition to property taxes, residents also can defer payments on personal property taxes
motor vehicle taxes, and sewer fees, in recognition of the financial hardships brought on the by the COVID-19 crisis.
This action was taken in response to Gov. Ned Lamont's April 1, 2020 Executive Order 7S (EO7S) — Protection of Public Health and Safety during COVID-19 Pandemic and Response.
EO7S allows local legislative bodies authority to adopt programs to support local taxpayers
affected by the COVID-19 crisis. (Don't miss local and statewide news about coronavirus developments and precautions. Sign up for Patch alerts and daily newsletters.)
This is from the town's tax deferment announcement:
The tax deferment program is open to all qualified residents, non-profits and
businesses, including landlords. To qualify, non-landlord taxpayers must attest that their
income has decreased by at least 20 percent during the emergency period due to layoffs, furloughs, business closures or other factor related to COVID-19. Landlord taxpayers must attest that their income has decreased by 30 percent. For those who pay their taxes in escrow, financial institutions will continue to remit property taxes to the Town to meet the original July 1st date.
""Tonight the Town Council approved the deferral of property taxes for 3 months
(without interest) for residents who are significantly affected by the COVID-19 crisis,"" said Town Council Chairman John Engel. ""A simple application requiring minimal data will be required. Our goal was to give affected residents the greatest benefit without impacting the town's ability to operate smoothly and I believe we achieved that tonight.
""I want to particularly thank the town's Chief Financial Officer, Lunda Asmani for helping
us better understand the town's financial position in this period of great uncertainty. With his
help the town's leadership delivered the leanest budget in years and now plans its cash
management with confidence that we will continue to provide the excellent services residents
expect.""
Program instructions and forms will be posted on the Tax Collector's page of the Town
website shortly.

7,/connecticut/newcanaan/first-selectman-defends-business-approach-coronavirus,2020-04-23T15:39:40Z,Resident Urges More Visibility From Kevin Moynihan,1,5,Alfred Branch,Patch Staff,"NEW CANAAN, CT — It is a question that leaders often ask themselves, how much is too much? For New Canaan First Selectman Kevin Moynihan the question centers on his visibility, or lack thereof, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Moynihan, whose professional background was in corporate law, has largely taken a busy-behind-the-scenes approach during the health crisis, and has delegated the role of the face of the town's response to Emergency Management Director Mike Handler.
As Moynihan likes to say about himself, he's ""a work horse not a show horse,"" happy to eschew the limelight.
""We have an incredible Emergency Management Team and we communicate as a team,"" Moynihan says. ""Mike Handler has been the voice of Emergency Management for the Town for over 10 years even though he is a volunteer and not an employee.""
However, for one resident and some of her friends, that behind-the-scenes approach is not enough. (Don't miss local and statewide news about coronavirus developments and precautions. Sign up for Patch alerts and daily newsletters.)
The resident, who Patch is not naming because she did not send the letter to the publication, recently wrote to Moynihan and criticized the seemingly hands-off approach.
""In times of trouble the citizens of the town expect to have the leader of our town front and center, guiding the way, encouraging us, sharing vital information with us, grieving with us, protecting us, and being truthful and transparent with us on a daily basis,"" she wrote.
""Myself and many others I've spoken to are wondering where you've been, and why you aren't visibly at the helm for all to look toward, rely on and count on?"" she added. ""I don't want to hear emotionless, at times cryptic messages from Mike. I want to hear from you, the leader of our community. And we want to know details and statistics every single day, as we try to follow what's happening within our community.""
Moynihan agrees that there may be a perception in the community that he's not around, nothing could be further from the truth.
He works nine to 10-hour days, participating in daily coronavirus-related meetings while also continuing to run town government.
But Moynihan admits that Handler's dry approach to communications occasionally can appear underwhelming.
""I've discussed [Mike's] style several times with him because many residents find his tone funereal while others find it comforting and reassuring,"" Moynihan says. ""Emergencies usually last a week or two, and Mike and I have debated the messaging style and content in this unprecedented pandemic.""
The resident, however, wants more. ""Mr. Moynihan, we need to hear your voice, your concern for our community, your explanation of the parks closing, the death rate, the testing, the store closings,"" she wrote. ""We need to feel that the leader of our town is standing shoulder to shoulder with us. The calls should be more conversational in tone, strict when warranted, sincere, completely informative. Talk to us about the chaos at Acme, the empty shelves, the fact that we can't find toilet paper, or disinfectant. Guide us on what to do. Give us tips on best days of the week to shop at Acme or Walter Stewarts. Tell us how to keep our elderly out of the stores when there is a limit on how many boxes of kleenex you can purchase. I try to shop for my Dad and my Aunt, but I'm only allowed 'one' of so many items. Tell us what to do in those cases. Talk to us about our neighboring towns, what are they doing, how are they doing?""
While the town does not have a full-time communications person, Moynihan says that he will try to be more visible in the future."
8,/connecticut/newcanaan/opinion-staying-connected-disconnected-world,2020-04-06T19:01:07Z,Opinion: Staying Connected In A Disconnected World,0,0,Alfred Branch,Patch Staff,"The following op-ed was written by Toni Boucher, businesswoman and former Connecticut State Senator and State Representative.
Right now, many are finding it hard to notice the signs of spring. And April may very well be the ""cruelest month."" It may also be difficult to accept that what keeps us apart now will ultimately bring us closer together. But spring is here, and things will get better. The question is when.

Uncertainty has become the norm and the world is changing as we know it. Previous benchmarks and performance no longer apply. Businesses, education, and nonprofits are restructuring daily as they experience disruptive forces like never before. COVID- 19 is accelerating the move to online work and school environments; robotics automates across industries, and virtual marketplace and online delivery options are taking the place of brick and mortar retailers.

Working and learning from home may reverse the emergence of intercity living, thus reducing the need for large office and apartment facilities. Will this permanently change our world?

A recent Forbes' article reports that September tuition payments may determine a college's eventual viability. Colleges have already been struggling with lower enrollment numbers that have tested their ability to survive. The prospect of closures has become very real the longer sequestering continues.

Fear of an unseen enemy, human contact, job loss, savings depletion, and sequestering are also taking a toll on the nation's mental health. Loss of normalcy and predictive schedules have taken away a sense of control. Disappointment in the cancellations of graduations, weddings, funerals and something as simple as major league and local sports, adds to anxiety. Insecurities do not have an easy outlet. Given that 20% of our population are already dealing with some type of stress, there may be an increase in substance abuse and depression. We may need to find new ways to cope.

Necessity is the Mother of Invention
Since this is a world-wide problem there may also be a silver lining. The planet's most brilliant minds are relentlessly working around the clock on solutions that are changing healthcare and its delivery faster and better than anyone could have ever imagined. There are dozens of leading companies that have or will have a vaccine in human clinical trials. There are also promising remedies being tested as we speak. There is even evidence that when a vaccine is developed, a single dose, rather than a yearly flu vaccine, would be needed to prevent a further occurrence. The emergence of tele-healthcare and tele-therapy are rapidly growing in use. Remote diagnosis and treatment are being normalized. New technologies are emerging, and current ones are being adapted and deployed at an astounding rate. Businesses, governments, nonprofits, schools, and families are connecting via Cisco Webex, Zoom, etc. to meet, vote, conduct business, fundraise, invest, teach and… draw closer together. It is inspiring to observe the unleashing of innovation as this global menace tries to wrestle us to the ground. History has shown, however, that we are at our strongest whenever we are severely challenged.

People Helping People
Mr. Rogers said: ""When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping."" America is the most generous country on earth. Its people are helpful and compassionate. We find heroes in everyday people lending a hand to each other and their neighbors. They are stepping up to shop and deliver to the elderly and infirm. PPE supplies are being made at home and donated by the thousands. Go Fund me pages are being created for the sick and their families, providing thousands of dollars of financial support. Truckers are delivering critical goods; postal workers are delivering our mail; grocery workers are stocking shelves; manufacturers are producing much needed products; first responders and the medical community are on the front lines, putting themselves in harm's way every day. They remind us that we are all in this together. Together we will overcome the challenge before us and be stronger for it."

Below is Handler's announcement:
Good Afternoon,

It is 3:45 pm on March 11th and this is Mike Handler with an important update on the novel coronavirus. All of New Canaan's public safety agencies have been working continuously, under a unified command structure, to review emergency operations plans in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus in our region and throughout the United States. As positive tests have been confirmed in neighboring communities, we have been preparing for the eventuality that New Canaan would have its first confirmed case. We now have confirmation from the State Department of Health of New Canaan's first positive case of COVID-19. This individual is receiving appropriate care and our thoughts are with the patient and the patient's family.

As is standard protocol, our team is already coordinating with the State to diligently trace all potential individuals this patient may have had contact with during the presumed incubation period. As per the CDC guidance any individuals who have been in direct contact with this patient will be notified and placed on a fourteen day at-home self-monitoring protocol with public health supervision and they will be medically monitored remotely by our local health director.

We have been preparing for this and want to carefully detail the impact that this will have on our community and the rationale behind our decisions. Please keep at the forefront of your minds that while information is rapidly changing and events are dynamically unfolding, our emergency operations plans continue to provide a strong backbone for our response.

What does this mean for New Canaan?

Schools
All New Canaan Public Schools will close on Thursday, March 12, 2020 and will remain closed for a minimum of 14 calendar days. School Superintendent Dr. Bryan Luizzi will be implementing their continuity of education plan so that classroom instruction can continue remotely. Information on the plan, including e-learning, will be communicated by the district directly to students and parents. Country Day School, St. A's and St. Luke's will close and follow the Public Schools. All Pre-School programs will be sharing their plans directly with their families.

Why are our schools being closed?
We have NO information that the individual who is presumed to have tested positive for COVID-19 had any direct contact with any school staff members or students. However, thorough contact tracing will take several days to complete. What we do know is that COVID-19 is present in our community and our objective is to slow down the viral spread.

What else is being closed?
Public buildings such as the Lapham Community Center will close to the public. The New Canaan Library will close and follow the Public School procedures until further notice. We will provide updates on these closures periodically. Town Hall will be open for limited hours for essential services only. Please call (203) 594-3000 in advance of arriving at Town Hall.

What are we asking the community to do?
While this is not yet a situation where we are ordering mass self-isolation or quarantine, we are asking that you avoid large gatherings and to maintain appropriate social distancing of at least six feet. We are encouraging individuals to stay home as much as possible to reduce their personal risk of being exposed, but also to limit the spread of the virus. Continue to follow www.cdc.gov guidelines with respect to hand-washing, finding alternative ways to greet people and hard surface cleaning. Early information out of China, where COVID-19 first started, shows that some people are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness. If you are over the age of 65 and/or have any underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, HIV, cancer treatment or any other immune deficiency the CDC urges you to significantly reduce human contact as much as possible. We are asking all residents to limit travel.

All pertinent information regarding the novel coronavirus can be found at the CDC website, www.cdc.gov. I would encourage everyone to regularly get updated information directly from this CDC site, as things are evolving rapidly. We continue to follow our emergency operations plans, and will swiftly adapt them should any new information or guidance become available.

If you are sick and require emergent medical attention, please call 911. We ask that you be patient and answer all of the dispatcher's questions so that we may appropriately and safely serve your needs. In certain instances where appropriate, you may be advised to self-transport to the hospital. In these instances, we will make certain that the appropriate receiving hospital is notified in advance of your arrival so that they may take all necessary precautions. If you are sick and do not require immediate medical attention, please contact your personal healthcare provider via telephone and discuss your needs, as appropriate.

The Emergency Operations Center will continue to be operational. We will share updates as new information becomes available via the Town's Outcall System and Facebook at facebook.com/newcanaanoem/. All information is being posted to the Town's website at www.newcanaan.info under the COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS link. Additionally, you may reach the State of Connecticut information line by calling 211. Please call (203) 594-4100 with any questions or concerns and reserve 911 for true life-threatening emergencies.

We know that this is unsettling and affecting all of us differently. Taking care of each other is our first priority.

Thank you,
Mike Handler"

March 6 2020
NEW CANAAN, Conn. – Grace Farms Foundation (GFF) convened a major symposium, Partnerships to Combat Modern Slavery, that brought together 150 law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and survivors of human trafficking. The goal of the symposium was to train law enforcement personnel to identify the signs of human trafficking and child exploitation and work together to combat it. The day-long symposium was held on March 4 at Grace Farms and was attended by representatives of the United States Attorney's Office in Connecticut, the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, the Department of Homeland Security (HSI), the Secret Service, the FBI, the Connecticut State Police, and GFF.
""This week's symposium is a tremendous example of GFF's collaborative and interdisciplinary model to combat human trafficking,"" said Chief Accountability Officer & Justice Initiative Director Rod Khattabi. ""Our partnership approach ensures that government entities, law enforcement officials, and survivors of human trafficking and child exploitation will have their perspectives represented and their voices heard. This is critical to raising awareness of these crimes and working together to eradicate these injustices.""
""This symposium highlights valuable information we each bring to the table to aid in the fight against human trafficking,"" said acting Special Agent in Charge Jason Molina of HSI Boston. ""HSI is proud to participate and share our global experience and wide-ranging resources with our law enforcement and NGO partners.""
""In 1994, The U.S. Secret Service was mandated by Congress to lend its forensic resources to law enforcement agencies in support of cases involving missing and exploited children,"" stated the U.S. Secret Service. ""We are excited to participate in this symposium to illustrate our capabilities. Our unwavering commitment to reduce child exploitation comes from a relentless compassion to educate and protect our nation's children.""
""Collaboration is particularly important in identifying human trafficking enterprises, and I sincerely thank Grace Farms for coordinating and hosting this important conference,"" said U.S. Attorney John H. Durham. ""Fortunately, Connecticut law enforcement agencies have a long history of working together to address threats to the public's safety and well-being. Connecticut's U.S. Attorney's Office will continue to work closely with our municipal, state, and federal counterparts, and numerous non-governmental organizations, to identify, investigate, and prosecute aggressively those who prey on the vulnerable victims of human trafficking.""
""It's essential to include survivors with life experience for the work of anti-trafficking globally,"" said Shandra Woworuntu, Founder and CEO of Mentari, survivor advisor to the ODIHR-OSCE, who was also a keynote speaker at the symposium. ""Survivors give significant input and recommendations to establish trust between law enforcement and survivors, to build trauma-informed frameworks that are critical to the process of identifying those involved in human trafficking, and to help develop best practices to help survivors fulfill their needs.""
Partnerships to Combat Modern Slavery focused on all aspects of combating modern slavery, from the investigative phase through prosecution of crimes and supporting survivors of these crimes. In the past three years, GFF has held more than 30 national and international trainings and symposiums with more than 2,000 officials in attendance.

16,/connecticut/newcanaan/new-canaan-prepares-2020-census,2020-02-28T01:20:31Z,New Canaan Prepares For 2020 Census,0,0,Alfred Branch,Patch Staff,"NEW CANAAN, CT — As the nation gets set for the 2020 census, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and New Canaan officials on Thursday kicked off the town's efforts to count its residents.
New Canaan is one of 169 communities in Connecticut, and Bysiewicz said that so far New Canaan and more than 150 others have formed ""complete count committees"" that will help raise awareness for the process throughout the spring.
""The census is the foundation for federal spending, and in Connecticut, you could say that there are 11 billion reasons to get it right,"" Bysiewicz said during the kickoff event in Town Hall.
She was referring to the $11 billion Connecticut stands to receive in funding and grants from 55 federal government programs annually based on the state's population of nearly 3.6 million. If the population is not counted correctly and the number drops, the state could suffer a loss of $2,900 per person.
In fact, Connecticut lost a Congressional representative in the 2000 census, bringing the state's Congressional Delegation down to five representatives from six.
Participating in the census is easy, officials said. Households will begin receiving postcards on March 12 urging them to fill out the form online or by telephone. In April, those households that did not fill out it out online or by phone will receive a printed form in the mail. Those households that do not send those back will receive a visit from a census taker beginning in May.
The count is based on where a person spends most of their time, said Lisa Moore, assistant regional census manger in Connecticut. That means that college students will be counted as part of the school they attend, and people with vacation homes will be counted by their main residence.
Officials also want people to know that census data will not be used to personally track or investigate them.
""We understand that there may be some people who might be nervous giving their personal information to the federal government, but we want them to know that their personal information will be protected and will be safe,"" Bysiewicz said.
By law, personal information collected during the census cannot be shared with any other government agency or law enforcement entity, she said.

The ""2020 Residential Satisfaction Study,"" conducted in January by the Glastonbury-based firm GreatBlue Research, Inc., received more than 2,100 responses online and by phone. The survey's margin of error was +/- 1.9 percent, with a confidence level of 95 percent, officials said. More than 400 randomly selected residents responded to the phone survey, and more than 1,700 answered the survey online.
According to the results, more than seven-out-of-ten, or 73.1 percent, reported they ""strongly agree"" (22.3 percent) or ""somewhat agree"" (50.8 percent) with the following statement: ""Living in New Canaan is a good value for the taxes I pay and services I receive."" Additionally, a strong majority, 89.5 percent, reported they would be ""very likely"" (55.8 percent) or ""somewhat likely"" (33.7 percent) to recommend New Canaan as a place to live.
View the full survey.
Also, more than half of the town's residents (or 52.3 percent) reported their current perception of New Canaan ""meets expectations"" they had prior to moving to the town. One-quarter of residents (25.8 percent) reported New Canaan ""exceeds expectations,"" while 18.5 percent reported the town ""falls short of expectations.""
""This survey will be important in helping the town government gain a better understanding of the priorities of its residents and will act as a guide in making decisions that best reflect the goals and needs of its population,"" officials said in a statement at the time of its launch.
Again, more than 70 percent of residents (71.8 percent) reported that primary reason — or one of the primary reasons — they chose to live in New Canaan was ""quality of schools."" That was followed by ""downtown village"" (42.1 percent) and ""family friendliness/strength of the community"" (35.0 percent). ""Quality of schools"" (50.0 percent), ""family friendliness/strength of the community"" (37.5 percent) and ""downtown village"" (33.2 percent) were also the top three reasons why residents have decided to continue living in New Canaan.
From the town's announcement on survey's results:
Over two-fifths of residents reported ""affordability of living"" (45.9 percent), ""state income taxes"" (43.5 percent), ""state taxes"" (42.2 percent) and ""local property taxes/mill rate"" (40.9 percent) would cause them to move from New Canaan to another town or state.
While the highest frequency of residents reported they believe New Canaan's taxes are
""about the same"" as ""Darien"" (69.5 percent), ""Westport"" (60.5 percent), ""Wilton"" (41.9 percent) and ""Greenwich"" (37.7 percent), three quarters of respondents (75.2 percent) reported they believe New Canaan's taxes are ""lower"" than taxes in ""Westchester County."" Further, over one-third of residents reported they believe New Canaan's taxes are ""higher"" than ""Greenwich"" (37.0 percent) and ""Wilton"" (34.2 percent).
The highest frequency of residents reported the ""library annual operating budget"" (29.0 percent),
""public works (road maintenance, snow plowing, sidewalks, etc.)"" (28.2 percent), and ""schools"" (27.9 percent) as the areas New Canaan should ""increase"" spending for now or in the near future. In addition, the highest frequency of respondents (23.1 percent) reported they believe New Canaan should ""decrease"" spending for ""open space.""

The Selectmen's budget recommendation now goes to the Board of Finance for review in February (where it may be adjusted) and a Board of Finance budget recommendation then will go to the Town Council for review, where it may be accepted, reduced or rejected by April 2nd.
The Total Expenditure Budget includes Board of Education operating and healthcare expenses of $92.77 (up 1.47 percent), Town operating and health care expenses of $38.42 million (up 0.25 percent), debt service of $16.98 million (up 0.84 percent), and tax-funded capital projects of $1.72 million (down 0.64 percent).
First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said ""The Board of Selectmen's 2021 Budget includes an extremely lean Town operations budget that conforms to Board of Finance Budget Guidance that Town operations (excluding healthcare expense) should decline 2 percent from the current fiscal year's revised budget amount. The reduction in Town operations expense of minus 2 percent is the first negative Town Department's operations budget in more than a decade and recognizes that reductions for some Town services and personnel expense are necessary to achieve a lower level of annual taxation of residents and a lower mill rate.""
Moynihan further stated: ""The proposed Board of Education's operations budget (excluding healthcare expense) increases by 4.23 percent over the current fiscal year budget. However, the BOE's total operating budget benefited from a $2 million reduction in health benefits reserves due to favorable claims experience and related plan savings.""
The First Selectman also noted that the Town Assessor has reported that the town's 2019 Grand List increased by 0.74 percent to $7.76 billion from the 2018 Grand List of $7.70 billion.

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue currently facing our state is the coronavirus pandemic. I have been focusing on supporting our frontline workers with PPE needs, assisting the unemployed with their unemployment claims, and guiding local businesses with COVID support loans. I also assisted the Real Estate community when they were in freefall and helped them land softly and prepared for the largest boom in real estate sales Connecticut has seen in recent memory. I'm privileged to be endorsed by Connecticut REALTORS® because of those efforts. In our July special legislative session, I focused my efforts on legislation that would improve access to healthcare and that would lower costs of insulin. I led the push for early and no-excuse absentee voting so no voter felt that casting a vote would be unsafe, and increased accessibility to polls for in-person voters. There will be a long road to recovery in our state, and strong finance minded experts will be needed to focus on our state's budget. I have helped companies in tough situations with their budgets driving them to think long-term and strategically. I also work hard for you in Appropriations Committee reviewing the allocation of Federal CARES dollars and will carry this on in my next term.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
The most striking difference between my opponent and me is our position on healthcare. Healthcare is a fundamental right for every citizen in Connecticut, and it's my duty to preserve and enhance that right. I have a unique ability to work directly on these efforts given my Vice-Chair position on the Insurance Committee, as well as my seat on the Appropriations Committee, Human Services Committee, and the Medical Assistance Program Oversight Council (MAPOC). It's why in 2019 I helped codify into statute insurance coverage for preexisting conditions, protecting our residents from any changes at the federal level.
I also helped pass two additional bills that will reduce healthcare costs, increase healthcare equity, and protect our most vulnerable Connecticut residents during the pandemic. Additionally, worked to cap the cost of insulin and other diabetic supplies. My opponent supports Trump's policies that strip healthcare from Americans, eliminate coverage of pre-existing conditions, and during his time in office voted for an anti-women amendment that eliminated protections for pre-existing conditions, as well as voted against a bill that secured quality care for our seniors and citizens with disabilities who live in assisted living facilities. Our citizens deserve quality, affordable healthcare and I'll work every day to ensure Connecticut is leading the way.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I see my strong constituent service record as State Representative being based upon my values and priorities as a mother of school-age children and an engaged member of my local community, combined with the skills and experiences acquired over 25 years working in business finance and accounting. I started out as an auditor in Public Accounting and progressed to executing deals as an investment banker before becoming the CFO for start-up technology companies. This gives me a deep understanding of what goes into long-term business plans and strategies and how best to achieve them. Much of my life has been spent working in different countries and cultures where I have learned how to collaborate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. Connecticut needs to stabilize its financial future to ensure ongoing funding for our schools, healthcare, transportation, and more, and my experience enables me to contribute strongly to the state's budgeting process.

Do you believe Connecticut needs reform when it comes to electric utility oversight? What steps, if any should be taken?
Yes. Connecticut needs electric utility oversight reform immediately, which is why I was honored to work on and pass HB 7006. The Take Back Our Grid Act ensures our money is used efficiently and effectively, improving communication and holding big utilities accountable to ratepayers. This will be guaranteed via performance-based rate-making, where regulators establish performance standards that the utilities must meet. It develops metrics for determining progress, and regulators can issue penalties if the utilities fail to meet the standards. Additionally, this legislation provides credits for spoiled food and medicines; reduces charges when lack of preparation by the utility leads to outages lasting more than 96 hours; ties executive salaries (that are funded by ratepayers) to performance; requires minimum staffing levels for the linemen, communications personnel, and others to make sure the utilities respond to storms quickly and convey information to their customers in a timely fashion; and strengthens regulator (PURA) oversight of utilities. PURA has investigations ongoing for the summer rate increase and the storm response, and I am eager to see their findings.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
My priority is our physical and fiscal well-being. I worked with relevant agencies to secure resources, fix issues with unemployment applications, and help businesses apply for aid. We expanded telemedicine, brought additional testing sites to our community, opened a COVID-19 recovery center, expanded affordable childcare options for front-line workers, and delayed due dates for taxes. I worked directly with the Board of Realtors, the Governor, and the DECD to ensure the functionality of real estate transactions. We have an opportunity to build a stronger state while guided by public health experts.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
Beyond the aforementioned issues of our fiscal and physical health and healthcare, including our state's economic viability and residents' access to quality healthcare, my priorities are focused on education, jobs, infrastructure, gun safety, reproductive and women's rights, and the environment. I invite you to check out Lucy2020.com for a fuller picture of my stances on each issue.
Integral to all of my beliefs and the policy that informs them is my core understanding that every single person was born with unalienable rights, and is deserving of their life, their liberty, and the pursuit of their happiness. This is why I endeavor to be an ally and a champion of all people no matter who they are, or who they love, or what they believe in insofar as their beliefs do not harm others. Our nation is made better by each and every voice that is lifted and heard, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, disability, religion, immigration status, or otherwise. It is not in spite of but because of our differences that we are a dynamic and powerful country.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I sit on Appropriations with three sub-committee appointments: Transportation, Economic Development, and Legislative. Appropriations is the spending side of the State's annual $22B budget. As a CFO and a CPA, I have scrutinized the financial picture of companies both on a high level as well as on a detailed line-item basis. This has informed my approach to our State Budget these last two years, extensively examining each state agency's budget line by line.
Like you, I pride myself on being an independent thinker, searching for the root of an issue to gain an informed understanding from which we can move forward with actionable items. To date, my private sector and legislative career has reflected this process. I love delving into research and learning as much as possible about an issue down to the very last, smallest detail, and I cherish learning from my constituents, local leaders, and experts on all matters that impact our community. As your voice in Hartford, I represent both your values and hopes for your state. I endeavor to always be approachable and accessible so that we can find solutions to our most pressing problems together, as a team. I envision a world that, bolstered by your thoughtful input, advances the state through economic recovery with a strict commitment to fiscal health as well as each resident's wellbeing."

Sept. 15, 2020
Breaking with tradition, CT Realtors (CTR), the largest professional trade association in Connecticut, has endorsed State Senator Alex Kasser for re-election. CTR has historically endorsed the Republican candidate in this Senate district.
""I am honored to receive their vote of confidence and to continue to work closely with CTR to create the conditions for a strong real estate market,"" said Senator Kasser. ""For most people, their home is their main investment and to ensure that home values increase over time, we need people to move to Connecticut, not just temporarily during the pandemic, but permanently,"" she added.
The mission of CTR is ""to make our state a better place to live and work and play"" and Senator Kasser shares those priorities.
""Like CTR, I'm focused on policies that create fiscal stability and improve quality of life. I believe we can have thriving communities that feel safe and welcoming to everyone, with excellent schools and infrastructure, where property values rise and taxes go down,"" said Senator Kasser.
As Chair of the Banking Committee, Senator Kasser introduced several bills supported by CTR. One of these bills was SB72 which addressed the burden of student loan debt. This issue was one of CTR's 2019-2020 legislative priorities. In their public policy statement, CTR recognized that ""student debt has delayed home purchases by nearly seven years. CTR supports efforts to identify opportunities for employer grants or loans to address student loan debt without additional income tax burden."" Senator Kasser's bill did exactly that and when it was passed in the Senate and House and signed by the Governor, it became the first law in the state to reduce student debt for graduates of colleges in CT and residents of CT who graduate from a college located outside the state.
Senator Kasser and CTR share many other priorities including improving the transportation systems in Connecticut and protecting the environment, clean soil and safe water. Senator Kasser is Vice Chair of the Transportation Committee and introduced several bills to improve transportation. Before she ran for office, Senator Kasser was an environmental advocate who ran ""Greening our Children,"" a local organization dedicated to educating parents and ensuring a safe living environment for children, free of harmful toxins.
Another priority that both Senator Kasser and CTR share is the elimination of the Estate & Gift Tax. Senator Kasser introduced a bill on this in 2019 to keep retirees and wealthy families from leaving the state. ""The state loses more money than it gains by having this tax,"" she noted ""and as a fiscally responsible Democrat, I will continue to fight for its elimination.""
""The real estate market is a leading indicator for the economy and I take great pride in having earned this endorsement from real estate professionals who are on the front lines of marketing our state and welcoming new residents and businesses,"" noted Senator Kasser.

Kimes replaces Mike Handler, who resigned from the post in June after nearly 10 years in the role. New Canaan Fire Chief Jack Hennessey had been serving in the role on an interim basis following Handler's resignation.
Handler and Moynihan began to clash during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, which Handler saying that he could no longer ""do what is in the best interest of the people of New Canaan"" under Moynihan.
For his part, the First Selectman said that he had been receiving complaints from staff about how Handler dealt with some of them, which contributed to the resignation.
Moynihan hopes to avoid such a situation with Kimes, a third-generation, lifelong resident of New Canaan. His appointment to director was unanimously approved by the Board of Selectmen on Monday, and at the same time, Philip Scheibley also was unanimously named Deputy Emergency Management Director.
""First, I want to thank Fire Chief Jack Hennessey for his service and leadership as Acting EMD since early June, and especially during the recent Tropical Storm Isaias, where he stood up the EOC for eight days straight,"" said Moynihan. ""Jack served as Deputy EMD for almost a decade and remains a key member of the EOC team.
""New Canaan is very fortunate to have an amazingly talented and experienced Emergency Operations Center team, of which Russ Kimes and Phil Sheibley have been important members. I am very pleased that Russ has stepped up to lead and further serve his hometown as Emergency Management Director as he has for many years as a volunteer leader with Fire Company #1, and as he served our country as a Marine.""
Kimes has been a volunteer of Fire Company #1 for 22 years, and also is a certified emergency medical technician and ""has many years of experience working in the New Canaan Emergency Operations Center including the major events Hurricanes Sandy and Irene.""
Additionally, Kimes is employed full time as a vice president with a leading global investment bank in New York City where he leads the HR Data Governance function, according to Moynihan. He served in the United States Marine Corps for eight years, and was deployed to Iraq in 2003. He also serves as Commander of New Canaan's Howard M. Bossa and Peter C. Langenus Post 653 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
Sheibley is a 16-year resident of New Canaan who retired from a 30-year career with Accenture where he held a leadership role in consulting in the Life Sciences industry. He also has been a volunteer with the town's all-volunteer Emergency Management Service (ambulance service) since 2015, for which he served over the last two years as Captain, responsible for EMS operations including the liaison role with the Emergency Operations Center in emergencies.
Additionally, Sheibley is a former board member of the New Canaan Community Foundation and serves as vice-chair of the board of trustees of Lehigh University, his alma mater.
""Russ and Phil will make a terrific team to keep New Canaan prepared for future emergencies and to keep our residents safe,"" Moynihan said. ""I personally am very grateful for their dedication and service to our community."""

State Senator Will Haskell secured two major endorsements this week for re-election. Both Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut's 4th District and Planned Parenthood Votes! Connecticut endorsed the first-term legislator for re-election in Connecticut's 26th Senatorial District. The endorsements are a clear reminder that major national issues are on the ballot this year at the state legislative level.
""Sometimes, state legislative candidates like to pretend that big, national issues don't affect us here in Connecticut. From two years in the state Senate, I can tell you that that's not true.
When Donald Trump cut federal funding for women's health and attacked the legitimacy of Roe v. Wade, it fell on my colleagues and me in Hartford to protect reproductive health in Connecticut,"" said Haskell. ""That's why I'm especially grateful to receive the endorsements of Congressman Himes and Planned Parenthood—a politician and an organization that know that the fight against the Trump agenda doesn't stop at the state border.""
""Will has been fighting for us on the issues that we care about most: on good gun safety regulation, on preserving our environment and the green space that is important to our quality of life, and of course on transportation—because Will understands that, without a good transportation network, we do not have growth, we do not have prosperity in our communities,"" said Himes. ""I've known him for a long time. His heart is in the right place; he is everything that we want in a public servant.""
Jim Himes, currently serving his sixth term in Congress, represents Connecticut's 4th Congressional District, which includes Bridgeport, Darien, Easton, Fairfield, Greenwich, Monroe, New Canaan, Norwalk, Oxford, Redding, Ridgefield, part of Shelton, Stamford, Trumbull, Weston, Westport and Wilton.

Rienzi, a 27-year-old Pound Ridge, New York, native.
Rienzi most recently served as a patrol officer with the Burlington, Vermont Police Department for the past six years. Additionally, he is also a member of the Pound Ridge Volunteer Fire Department.
He graduated from Fox Lane High School in Bedford, NY, after which he attained his bachelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Vermont.
This is from the department's announcement:
Nicholas participated in the winter 2020 recruitment process for Entry Level Police Officer with the New Canaan Police Department. He was one of over 100 candidates who submitted eligible applications for employment. Nicholas successfully endured an intensive testing and selection process including a written examination, physical agility testing, interview panel, polygraph, psychological evaluation, background investigation, medical testing, and Police Commission interview.
Nicholas was sworn in on July 31, 2020. As a sworn officer with an out-of-state certification, he will need to take various courses designated by POSTC to attain his Connecticut certification. He began his comparative certification training on August 3, 2020, the majority of which will take place at the New Canaan Police Department through distance learning. The tentative completion of that training will be at the end of August. After completion of that training, Nicholas will undergo approximately 8 weeks of field training with the New Canaan Police Department before being assigned solo patrol duties as a probationary police officer."

O'Dea Disappointed By Outcome Of Police...,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Press release courtesy of State Representative Tom O'Dea's Office: State Representative Tom O'Dea (R-New Canaan), a Deputy House Republican Leader and attorney, expressed his disappointment with the final outcome of the House debate and vote on H.B. 6004, An Act Concerning Police Accountability, which passed during a special session largely along party lines, 86-58-7. The bill passed in the Senate 21-15 with only one Democratic member voting with Republicans, and CT police.
House Republicans proposed an amendment removing the limit on qualified immunity from the bill. The amendment had support on both sides of the aisle, including 17 Democrats, but fell one vote short in a 72-72 tie.
""We tried to reach a fair comprise on an issue that affects everyone in the state of Connecticut. Members of the public, police chiefs, legislators, and many others weighed in, and their feedback is greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, the final bill was something I could not support because while it addressed some legitimate concerns raised by state residents, it will make our public less safe, cost our municipalities millions of dollars, and cause good police officers to be exposed to lawsuits and personal exposure without getting rid of the few bad officers"" said Rep. O'Dea.
""Qualified immunity, which has been in place and litigated since 1967, allows our police officers to make very difficult decisions in what can often be life or death situations, without fearing legal repercussions for judgement calls they believe to be the correct course of action at that point in time. Limiting this necessary protection and eliminating consent searches will make good active policing very difficult. Exposing good officers to personal liability without the ability to appeal until after a jury verdict will make it extremely challenging to recruit quality candidates for these vital roles in our communities, as well as retain current members of the force. There is no doubt this bill will have much broader implications for public safety and our local communities. This bill will make all of us less safe.""
This bill will also put a strain on local budgets. It will cost our municipalities millions of dollars to buy equipment and millions more for certifications, and millions more for insurance. All that money will have to come from property tax increases or by diverting funds from other areas. Finally, there were complaints from both sides of the aisle that the bill did not receive adequate public input since it was rushed as an emergency bill in special session during a pandemic without a traditional hearing process when the most egregious part of the bill does not go into effect until a year from now.
Continued Rep. O'Dea, ""If it was such an emergency, why does it go into effect in a year? This bill should have been raised during the 2021 regular session during which further public participation and criticism would have been possible.""
Some of the positives in the bill included greater mental health and drug testing for officers, as well as a requirement that body worn and dashboard cameras be used by all law enforcement personnel.
Another positive is that this legislation addresses an issue from the 2019 session concerning the state police union contract and the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. Under the 2019 contract, which was approved by Democratic legislators and opposed by Republicans, police records concerning disciplinary actions were shielded from FOI requests. Under H.B. 6004, this is will no longer be the case.
Concluded Rep. O'Dea, ""Please call Governor Lamont and ask him to veto House Bill 6004 so we can do this properly, in a bipartisan way, like we did with telehealth, absentee balloting and the insulin bills.""

Editor, Advertiser:
As a 1913 Library Building partisan I watched the Tuesday online Board of Finance meeting with special interest. My curiosity was aroused by the lack of discussion of the actual cost of the library project. I understand that the Town's financial commitment is limited to $10 million based on the library's overall projected cost of $35 million. Given the industry standard of cost per square foot this should be adequate for the construction.
However, a cursory review notes that omitted are the 'soft costs' for top level architects,, engineers, landscaping, permitting, interior design fees and expenses, etc. These requisite fees and expenses could be expected to add an additional $10 million to $15 million to complete the new library as planned. If those percentages are incorrect or not in proportion with what they are spending on fees, then I would be happy to be corrected with accurate data. Further those estimates do not even factor in the additional - as yet to be determined - construction expenses created by new requisite COVID-19 precautions.
If I'm correct about these projected figures the completed cost of the new library should be between $45 million and $50 million. How then does the town expect to handle this sizable deficit which will in some form fall to we taxpayers? I understand that Bankwell has offered to cover the possible overage with a $15 million line of credit, which should thankfully guarantee completion.
Those circumstances notwithstanding the debt service on that $15 million credit line along with that of the current $10 million bond commitment will fall to the taxpayer. It's not for me to suggest what the town should budget for the new library, but I do think we deserve an honest detailed cost estimate to build this new library. In addition I would like to know what the estimated increased operating expense projections are expected to be for the new expanded facility, 10,000 square feet larger than the current.
The Library Board could not have taken this project this far without having obtained these specific costs. Certainly these costs must have been reviewed and assessed by the Board of Finance prior to their $10 million commitment so I wonder why they are not available for review to settle this apparent discrepancy.
Let me stress two points. First, I am not opposed to a new library. Quite the contrary, a new facility is long overdue, although I have no affection for the proposed new design. Second, please know that despite my skepticism I would be delighted to have my rough cost assessment proven wrong and I'm hoping but not confident that will indeed be the case. The problem seems to be that no one seems to know where this information can be accessed.

Thank you, Ms Thomas, for your informative letter in the June 25 edition, ""Coming together for the New Canaan Library.""
I understand your feelings on most of what you say but do not agree on some of your remarks. Such as ""Why would anyone disparage the competence and dedication of library staff and volunteers?"" ""Why would they suggest that the library's motivation is not in line with the public feedback or the public good?"" ""Who would twist information to suggest that library is a burden to the taxpayers, rather than a tremendous benefit?"" etc., etc., etc. Is a great misunderstanding. There are many other benefits the library has to offer. It creates a learning as well as a social space for friends, parents and children.
As a contributor, friend and frequent visitor of the library, I feel your words are confrontational; they only create a division with those who would like to keep the 1913 section be preserved. Please do not misconstrue the words of the concerned citizens who care. We look forward to a new library, which will serve the public better in many ways.
Look at what was done with our Town Hall. A new section was added to the back preserving the front. This can be done with our future library.
And so it is time to act and show the world what our town is really made of. People who care for the historic value of New Canaan.

The New Canaan Preservation Alliance and the Friends of Our 1913 Library have engaged Boston-and-Newport-based Kirk & Company to recommend feasible reuse and financing approaches for the oldest part of the existing New Canaan Library complex.
The study is necessitated by the library's plan, made public in January, to replace the existing library complex with a new building. The existing complex grew by additions out from the original meticulously detailed 3,500-square-foot building that was the library's first permanent home. Replanning has been under consideration for more than a decade, with all previous iterations reusing the 1913 building in a new complex. The current proposal would site a new library building on library-owned land and replace the original 1913 building with an open lawn. The library is currently seeking a commitment of $10 million from the town for the project.
""The New Canaan Preservation Alliance and Friends of Our 1913 Library welcome the Library's desire to bring the institution into the 21st century and do not object to building a new library,"" said Kimberly Norton, chairman of the Friends of Our 1913 Library. ""While we can point to examples of recent library upgrades that successfully incorporate legacy historic buildings like ours, we realize that the library has chosen a different path.""
Therefore, considering the library's lack of inclusion of the 1913 library in their plan, our objective is ""save the 1913 building and to find a feasible reuse for our landmark library so residents can continue to enjoy this historic cornerstone of our community for another 100 years.""
The focus of the Kirk & Company study is limited to the 1913 building. It follows the preparation of a construction budget to rehabilitate the 1913 library prepared for the alliance by an experienced architectural preservation firm based on a conditions assessment conducted by preservation professionals. The assessment found the building, while incomplete in one corner as a result of its connection to a later addition, to otherwise be in excellent condition. The cost for rehabilitation following removal of the additions is projected to be $828,000 compared with an estimate of $3,032,603 prepared for the library that included much unnecessary work. For a comparison of the budgets, go to newcanaanpreservationalliance.org/1913-library-renovation-estimates.
""We are confident that the Kirk & Company recommendations will guide us towards a practicable solution that meets the library's goals of developing a new asset while preserving an existing asset,"" said Neele Banks Stichnoth, president of the New Canaan Preservation Alliance.
Kirk & Company is a real estate counseling firm with strong experience in successful development, financing, and investment consulting for rehabilitating and adapting historic properties to new uses. The 1913 library study will consider how local programs, regulations and the real estate market can best be leveraged to maximize the market positioning of the project.
Kirk & Company, founded in 1993, provides real estate appraisal and evaluation, market analysis, and counseling services to sophisticated market participants. Their specialized services include development and operating feasibility, marketability, appraisal and due diligence services for development, redevelopment, historic rehabilitation and adaptive reuse, financing, investment, disposition and litigation.

The New Canaan Preservation Alliance was formed in 2007 as a 501(c)(3) organization in response to rising concerns over the rapid disappearance of the town's historic built and natural environments.

The executive director of the New Canaan Library has told us to look at Darien as the model library for New Canaan to emulate. So we did. If Darien's experience after it built its library is anything to go by, the New Canaan Library's planned renovation really is shaping up to be a classic boondoggle.
Some data: After Darien built its new library in 2009 in a project very similar to what the New Canaan Library is contemplating now, after the first year rush, traffic there has fallen, even as operating costs to run the new, larger LEED, Gold (which should make it extra efficient) building soared from $2.9 million in 2007 to $4.99 million in 2019.
This was all pre-coronavirus, of course, and consistent with the trend across the state.
With all due respect to our friends in Darien, that can't be counted as a success in any way. There's little reason to think that the New Canaan Library will have a different experience once its new building is complete.
For data and charts, please see https://tinyurl.com/y4jj2g2z



Yet the library is dead set to go ahead with its scheme. And without giving New Canaan taxpayers any significant information. Will this turn into another public/private venture like the playing fields? Who will make-up the shortfall when the building comes in over budget? And what is the budget, and what is it based on?
If the library were funded by private donations, that would be one thing. But it's not. New Canaan taxpayers pony up 75% of the library's operating costs every year, and pay healthcare for the employees as well as the insurance on the property and building. We need to see the New Canaan Library Board's pro forma income statement, cash flow, and balance sheet model for the new library before we are asked to pay for it.
One thing we should take Darien's lead on is keeping the original building. At the very least, the renovation plans should be altered so that the 1913 Landmark legacy isn't torn down, so it can be repurposed (and it will give LEED credits!). The much-loved original 1913 building is an important link to New Canaan's past, and the town and library would do well to honor it."

Editor, Advertiser:
During the past month, New Canaan taxpayers have asked our town officials to provide more due diligence information to understand and support the $10 million they are asked to contribute to the new New Canaan Library. To date the taxpayers' request for more information has been ignored. Last week, on June 30, Mr. Henry Hawley wrote: ""We need a process that better involves the citizens of New Canaan. The process is broken. Perhaps we start with a detailed and transparent budget for the project. "" Thank you, Mr. Hawley.
The due diligence information regarding the New Canaan Library Association Inc.'s (""NCLA"") proposed new library building that I and many others are requesting is listed below.
To date and to my best knowledge, neither the NCLA's Library Building Committee nor the NCLA directors have provided concrete cost-estimating documents, including measured/detailed site plans, floor plans, elevations and detailed operating cost projections for the proposed new building.
Town of New Canaan officials have not provided projected carrying costs for the $10 million bond, the principal amortization and payments on which will be paid by New Canaan taxpayers. Even more significant, Town of New Canaan officials have not provided projections of any periodic contributions they will cause New Canaan taxpayers to make toward NCLA's future operations, and any projections of NCLA future operating deficits or surpluses.
NCLA's New Library Building Construction Cost Estimate: In 2018 NCLA estimated that the construction costs of its proposed new library building would be $25 million, and that it would request a $5 million capital contribution from New Canaan taxpayers. Providing no details or reasons, in early 2020 NCLA increased its estimate of the construction costs of its proposed new library building 20 percent to $30 million; and, initially with no details or reasons, increased its capital contribution ask of New Canaan taxpayers by the entire $5 million build cost estimate increase, to $10 million.
In the last three weeks, NCLA has, again, inexplicably and suddenly, increased its estimate of the costs to construct its proposed new library building an additional $5 million to $35 million; and New Canaan taxpayers are becoming discomfited with the conspicuous absence of detailed information from NCLA and from New Canaan government officials.
New Canaan taxpayers are asking: Where did the $35 million number come from?
The New New Canaan Library Building Program: Centerbrook Architects and Planners has developed a program, shown to date in the animated renderings, including an auditorium, children's room, MakerLab, nine meeting rooms, business center, cafe, reading rooms, gas fireplace and public roof garden. These animated renderings were designed to appeal to the NCLA Board, certain NCLA donors and pledgers, elected town officials and, ultimately to New Canaan taxpayers, However these visuals are divorced from dollars-and-cents reality; they do not address the budget and the associated burden to be carried by New Canaan taxpayers.
I understand that First Selectman Moynihan is prudently concerned that parking requirements attendant to a 48,000-square-foot new library building may be driving the latest sudden and yet unexplained $5 million increase to NCLA's now $35 million construction cost estimate. There should be even greater concern that costs to construct the new building itself, and to feature rich landscaping and landscaping, (excluding the parking,) as shown in the renderings would exceed the $35 million budget as well. Without construction documents, estimating the construction costs is not possible. Is it judicious to commit $10-plus million taxpayers' moneys without construction documents? Who will bear the responsibility if NCLA's ambitious project runs over budget? At the very least, New Canaan taxpayers must have certainty that, should the project come in over budget, they will not be responsible to pay for such overages.
NCLA Operating Costs: In addition to the $10 million capital commitment requested by the NCLA, New Canaan taxpayers pay the vast majority of NCLA's operating costs. When operating costs increase because of the new facility (due to additional space, additional personnel, need for more parking, greater mechanical systems and their maintenance and more overall facilities maintenance) all will be covered predominately by New Canaan taxpayers. New Canaan provides additional significant support by covering Library personnel's health insurance and pension costs centrally (as it does for other Town departments). I believe these are excluded from the Library operating expenses shown for fiscal year 2019 below.
The figures above will significantly increase with the new facility. Taxpayers should be provided these projections for various reasons as they will be responsible for paying the preponderance of the future costs as well.
Bond Financing and Carrying Costs: Taxpayers have not received this necessary information.
Yes, the process is broken at present, but it can be rectified with more due diligence information. Many agree with Mr. Hawley's suggestion: ""We start with a detailed and transparent budget and a strong level of oversight by the Town officials.""
I know that the Town Council conducted some manner of vote to proceed toward approval of the NCLA's $10 million capital contribution ask, without any condition that could enable the landmark 1913 Library Building to be preserved in situ and repurposed. Nevertheless, the Friends of the 1913 Library are performing good and proper due diligence toward repurposing the historic building. A budget, program, and construction documents are being developed. Feasibility studies are being conducted to determine operating costs, and an income-producing tenant to cover them will be designated.
Architects and preservationists care about neighborhoods and the integration of site and architecture in neighborhoods. The neighborhood in downtown New Canaan running north from 151 Main Street to the Historical Society campus is a controlled, historic span of our Town's history. The masterfully designed and executed stone and brick 1913 Library Building leads the way to significant brick buildings such as the Telephone Company Building, the Town Hall, the Fire Station, and the beautiful wooden historical churches on God's Acre. This distinctly New Canaan neighborhood has taken more that a century to create.
New Canaan has had the advantage of distinguished architecture and thoughtful planning and zoning: creative minds and skilled labor have made this neighborhood. We live in a town with a rich past and a drive for innovation in the future. To acknowledge and endorse the importance of both our past and our future is the affirmation of an enlightened community.
I want to thank the town officials for all the work they have done to date toward a new New Canaan library building. More work, reviewing and analyzing the due diligence information called out above must yet be done to ensure that we are all best informed as we all optimize this opportunity.

I am among a growing chorus of New Canaanites who actively oppose the demolition of our historic library building built in 1913. The library is a private public partnership between the Library Foundation and the Town of New Canaan. The building is technically private property so we should have no say in its destruction. Except that we citizens provide the lion's share of the funds to support the foundation. The library is now seeking from the town a $10 million (up from an original $5 million) contribution toward its demolition and the construction of a new facility. (Editor's Note: Library Director Lisa Oldham said the request has always been for $10 million.)
Let me set aside the notion that we who oppose the destruction of the 1913 structure oppose the library. I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't value the library and its central place in our community. But there is something to be learned from the manner in which the Library Foundation has prosecuted its case. It is filled with vagaries, misstatements and deceit.
There are no finished construction drawings of the new structure or detailed construction estimates. The amount of funds pledged by generous donors — whose identities are closely guarded (curious that) — and that which has been actually donated is veiled. One can fairly wonder the consequences if the new construction ran short of funds to complete the project, we taxpayers would doubtless be burdened with the shortfall.
They claim that the 1913 building is decrepit and water logged. That it would require millions to rehabilitate it as a free standing structure. That the only hope for its salvation is to move to another site — knowing, given the nature of its masonry construction, that is a practical impossibility. Several architects experienced in historic preservation have inspected the building, found it quite sound and have estimated a cost of something on the order of $700,000 to disentangle it from the claptrap leaky modern structure it is bound to. To further their case the foundation has created and bandied about at public hearings a clever piece of propaganda, a rendering of the 1913 building as an eyesore blocking out the proposed shinny new magnificence of their rubble and glass architectural confection.
Well, then, one new to this issue might fairly ask why can't both structures old and new coexist? Because the foundation insists the new modern library building must exist aesthetically unopposed by the presence of the historic old. Central to the their new vision for the site is a small green not much larger than a tennis court, on the land currently occupied by the historic library. Their vision of a town green is one that abuts a gas station, overlooks another gas station and a parking lot. It's hard to argue with green space if even this tiny sliver but there is mercifully no shortage of green-sword in New Canaan, Mead Park is just two blocks away. In short, one has to wonder why the foundation is pursing this project in such a duplicitous fashion rather than purely on it merits.
Thirty-five years ago, I was looking for a town to raise my six kids. The schools here were compelling but it was the bookstore and the library that sealed the deal. Any town that so valued books was where I wanted them raised. Added to that was visual beauty of the town. God's Acre is storybook New England, which even Norman Rockwell couldn't improve upon. With that we have the 1913 New Canaan Library arguably the finest piece of civic architecture in New Canaan. It is a marvelous combination of classical style and detailing mixed with a rusticated facade. A deft carefully articulated convergence of the urbane and the country. It is tragic to consider this town would conspire to sacrifice this historic treasure for the sake of a lawn. And sadder still that the effort is prosecuted in such a conscienceless manner.
The new library isn't at stake here, only the old. Let's permit the citizens of New Canaan the choice to oppose the demolition of this magnificent piece of our community's historical heritage.
Let's put it to a vote.

To the Editor,
Historic places connect us to our past, demonstrate our priorities and principles as well as reflect the values of a community.
Libraries have been an important part of American towns since 1833, when the first public library was founded. The New Canaan library is no different. The community has always felt strongly about its library as far back as 1877 when Albert Comstock and Jesse St. John left money in their estates to help build a permanent structure; this formed the cornerstone of the library we all know and love.
That same passion and dedication is reflected today as the community debates the new library facility. Yes, we can all agree that the library is important and the proposed new structure reflects the changing times and focus of the community, but as we move forward what does it say about us as a community when we cannot honor the past and build upon the ""old library"" and use it going forward? Preservation is using the past to make a good future. Using the ""best of a place"" can only improve the quality of our community and honor the principles that guided those before us.
We can continue to demonstrate and honor the tenets that knowledge, education and community are key principles which continue to bind us together today as they did in the past.
The 1913 portion of the library is a beautiful building, which has acted as an anchor in town, an important symbol which represents a dedication to learning and knowledge and by leaving it where it is, it will not impact the design of the current building but continue to serve the community which should be honoring it and repurposing this wonderful old structure.
Many great pieces of architecture have integrated the old and the new – think of the Louvre with its glass pyramid, the Morgan Library with its glass addition. Do we throw away a book because it doesn't fit the new shelves? No.We incorporate it, honor it and value it.
We can have the new library and the original one. They can live in harmony with the original library anchoring a second town green (God's acre is New Canaan's first). Let's keep the old library and reuse it for what it is – an important piece of the fabric of our town which many before us have thoughtfully valued and honored despite the pressures of modernization.

To the Editor,
I am sure the old library building can be preserved. We cannot destroy our beautiful historic buildings, especially one in the village.
Please, everyone who cares about this beautiful building, speak up to save it.
