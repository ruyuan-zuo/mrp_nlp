Early reports coming in show voters waiting in long lines to cast their ballots while also facing the challenge of maintaining at least six feet of distance between others.
Voters and poll workers did not know whether they would be participating in the election on Monday, after Gov. Tony Evers sought to postpone in-person voting until June via an executive order. The state has seen more than 2,440 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 77 coronavirus-related deaths. Schools were closed in mid-March, non-essential businesses have been shut down, and residents are restricted from non-essential travel in a ""safer at home"" order.
Sign up for Patch alerts and daily newsletters. Don't miss local and statewide news about coronavirus developments and precautions in Wisconsin.
Republican opponents fought back against Evers' order to delay in-person voting, filing a lawsuit with the State Supreme Court within hours. The conservative-leaning court ruled that Evers did not have the authority to postpone the election. Then, hours later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state's absentee ballot deadline extension was also unconstitutional, meaning that thousands of voters who had absentee ballots out — or who had yet to get them in the mail — have to turn them in or have them postmarked by Tuesday in order for them to count.
Results were not expected to be released election night, the Associated Press is reporting as of Tuesday morning. In the wake of a legal battle over whether to conduct the election as scheduled, a court ruling appeared to prevent results from being made public earlier than April 13.
Hundreds Of Absentee Ballots Won't Count
Neil Albrecht, executive director of the Milwaukee Election said a minimum of 750 absentee ballots in the City of Milwaukee do not have witness signatures and won't count in the election, he said in a JSOnline report. Voters are waiting more than two-and-a-half hours to cas their ballots at some Milwaukee polling locations. ""We have moved forward with an election, but we have not moved forward with democracy in the state of Wisconsin,"" he said.
Afternoon: Social Distancing 'Nearly Impossible'
According to a JSOnline report, Jeff Pothof, chief quality and safety officer for UW Health in Madison said it's "" nearly impossible to maintain social distancing throughout the process of going to the polls and voting. You can see some people quite close to each other, some wearing masks, some not,"" he said in the report.
Election Morning: Long Lines, Masks and Hand Sanitizer
In Madison, city workers erected Plexiglas barriers to protect poll workers, and voters were encouraged to bring their own pens to mark the ballots. Across the state, poll workers donned masks and gloves. Some wore surgical scrubs and protective gowns to the polling place. In many suburban Milwaukee communities, voters were either handed single-use pens or were asked to bring their own.
Kat Devlin, a magazine editor who works from her home in Milwaukee, applied for an absentee ballot during the third week in March but never received it. The state should have postponed the election, she said. ""It's just dangerous to have so many people going to the polls,"" she said.
Earlier last week, Waukesha officials consolidated all of the city's polling places into one at the Schuetze Recreation Center on Baxter Street.
One report from early Tuesday morning from Matt Smith showed voters — some with masks and some without — in long lines outside the polling place doors waiting for them to open.
An hour after polls opened Tuesday, Milwaukee journalist Mike De Sisti recorded a video showing voters slowly advancing in a line that stretched more than a block long outside Milwaukee's Riverside High School polling place. De Sisti reported wait times as long as 90 minutes just to get inside, with many people standing in close quarters.

April 3, 2020
Please note the following updates for the April 7, 2020 Spring Election and Presidential Preference Primary:
Your options for returning your completed ballot:
Witness Affirmation Requirement: On the evening of April 3 the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order removing the option for an absentee voter to submit a statement indicating they were unable to obtain a witness signature, in lieu of including a witness signature on the certificate envelope. Therefore, effective immediately, all voters MUST have a witness signature on their ballot for it to be counted. All discussion of this exemption in other materials, memos, and webinars related to this option which had been authorized by the decision of the District Court is now outdated and should be ignored.

Election Day: In-person voting is on April 7, 2020. The only polling place open in the City will be the Schuetze Recreation Center, 1120 Baxter St. Voting will be available from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm on Election Day, Tuesday, April 7.

In Waukesha, voters will be able to choose which candidate they want to see in the fall presidential election. Voters will also get to decide a number of statewide, county and local races that will appear on the ballot.
Polling Place Change
Due to a lack of available poll workers, on Election Day, Tuesday, April 7, the City of Waukesha will have only one Election polling location, officials said.
Waukesha officials said all residents will vote at the Schuetze Recreation Center, 1120 Baxter Street, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. No other polling locations will be open on April 7.
Inside the Schuetze Recreation Center, residents will be directed via signs showing their specific voting location.
New Rules For Absentee Ballots
Voters with absentee ballots will have to turn them in or have them postmarked by Tuesday to have them counted after a late ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court Monday night.
The U.S. Supreme Court handed down a consequential ruling for Wisconsin voters late Monday, overturning a lower court's ruling that extended Wisconsin's absentee ballot submissions by nearly a week.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge William M. Conley of the U.S. District Court - Western District of Wisconsin extended the deadline for absentee ballots to be received by election officials from 8 p.m. on election night to 4 p.m. on April 13. The move would have given poll workers more time to tally votes.
On Monday night, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Conley's ruling, voting along 5-4 lines to restore Wisconsin's former absentee ballot deadline. That means poll workers cannot accept absentee ballots that are postmarked after election day.

DNC officials say they're considering contingency plans for the 2020 DNC, and Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said he's staunchly in favor of keeping the April 7 presidential primary and statewide general election on-track despite critical shortages of poll workers, and the ongoing public health risks.
When MSNBC talk show host Brian Williams asked Biden whether he envisions seeing Democratic party faithful packing Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum for a week in July for the 2020 Democratic National Convention, amid the current coronavirus public health emergency, Biden said he was doubtful.

""It's hard to envision that,"" he said. ""We should listen to the scientists.""
Biden said the U.S. was able to have elections, and conventions during wartime because authorities could guarantee public safety. ""The fact is, it may have to be different,"" he said of the 2020 DNC.
Meanwhile, Sanders is calling on Wisconsin leadership to postpone the April 7 election.
""People should not be forced to put their lives on the line to vote, which is why 15 states are now following the advice of public health experts and delaying their elections,"" Bernie Sanders said in a statement. ""We urge Wisconsin to join them. The state should delay Tuesday's vote, extend early voting and work to move entirely to vote-by-mail.""
Sanders' statement comes on the heels of Evers saying he's going to call out the National Guard to shore up critical shortages of poll workers across the state.
Evers said he's calling out the National Guard to staff polling places across the state after election officials said nearly 60 percent of Wisconsin municipalities have an urgent shortage of poll workers.
Many jurisdictions have ""dramatically consolidated polling places,"" state official said. According to the Wisconsin Election Commission, there are 111 communities that do not have the ability to staff even one polling place on April 7. Wisconsin local election officials say they're about 7,000 poll workers short for election day.
By The Numbers
All data has been compiled by the Wisconsin Election Commission. This data was compiled when officials surveyed local municipalities about their capabilities on election day, April 7.

15,/wisconsin/waukesha/trains-waukesha-whats-been-done-ease-pain,2020-03-02T19:10:33Z,Trains In Waukesha: What's Been Done To Ease Pain,0,3,Scott Anderson,Patch Staff,"WAUKESHA, WI — If you live, work or drive a car in Waukesha, you know the inconveniences posed whenever trains pass through the city.
They cause traffic backups, delay motorists, including police and firefighters, and cause traffic to spill into neighborhoods whenever a main intersection is blocked by a passing train.
When we asked Waukesha Patch readers what they could fix if they were able, readers said addressing Waukesha's train problem was at the top of the list.
According to city officials, the first train ran from Milwaukee to Waukesha in 1851. The first road was platted in Prairieville in 1848. Trains have always been a large part of Waukesha's history, with most crossings being here before the streets were constructed.
As it turns out, being first matters. Now, stopping a train - even in Waukesha - is an exercise in futility.
Hard To Stop A Train
According to city officials, all the rights of the railroads are outlined in the Federal Railroad Administration, and cities do not have any rights over their operation.
According to State and Federal law, it's against the law to stop any railroad train, locomotive or car upon or across any highway or street crossing, outside of cities, or leave the same standing upon such crossing longer than 10 minutes, except in case of an accident.
Even if a local community has an ordinance that contradicts the Federal Railroad Administration, the local law will be preempted and therefore will be unenforceable, according to Waukesha city officials.
The Railroad does not even have to operate on any set schedule, and federal regulations preempt any state or local restrictions on train movements. The Railroad does not have to report any stoppage longer than 10 minutes, unless it is an accident.
It's Also Hard To Move A Train
Citing concerns by members of the public, and drivers seeking some relief from train delays, took a look at seeing what they could do to build an overpass at E. Moreland Blvd. near the Fox River. The idea was to put road traffic and train traffic on separate grades so they wouldn't interfere with one another.
Waukesha officials said in 2004, they entered a three-party contract with the Department of Transportation and an engineering consultant to study the feasibility of grade separating Moreland Blvd. and the Canadian National railroad track.
Officials said the result of an extensive study proved that it was not economically feasible to separate Moreland Blvd, at an approximate cost in 2004 of 15 million dollars and this solution would also close Whiterock Ave. at the crossing.
Tons Of Trains
There are 21 street-level railroad crossings on the main lines of the Canadian National and Wisconsin Southern Railroad in Waukesha. City officials say there are between 35-42 trains that pass through or switch in Waukesha each day.
According to city officials, Waukesha is on this main corridor and approximately 35-42 trains per The average speed through the City is 35 miles per hour.
In 2006 the City, along with the Department of Transportation sent a letter to the CN/WCL requesting the relocation of the main switch yard for the CN/WCL, located near Main Street, to a site outside of the City Limits. City officials said at the time that the 35-42 trains per day would still be moving through Waukesha, but the trains would not have to stop and switch at the yard.
Neither railroad company even bothered to respond to Waukehsa or the Department of Transportation, city officials said."
16,/wisconsin/waukesha/fox-run-would-have-new-apartments-clinic-bank-more-plans,2020-02-24T17:00:58Z,"Fox Run Would Have New Apartments, Clinic, Bank ",0,1,Scott Anderson,Patch Staff,"WAUKESHA, WI — Officials in Waukesha will get the chance to weigh a new site plan for the Fox Run Shopping Center, the likes of which is the subject of a new multi-million-dollar redevelopment.
According to city plan commission documents, the shopping center is proposed to be redeveloped with a medical clinic, bank, multi-family residential buildings, and retail building. City officials on the Waukesha Plan Commission will review plans at 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 26 at City Hall.
The existing Chase Bank will remain, but all other buildings on the 13.42-acre site will be razed and replaced with the new development.
Redevelopment of the site is proposed to include the following land use types and sizes:
Multi-Family Residential (Low-Rise) – 72 units
Medical Clinic – 31,000 square feet
Drive-in Bank – 2 drive-through lanes
Pharmacy/Drugstore w/Drive-Through Window – 15,000 square feet
Chase Bank (existing bank to remain) – 3 drive-through lanes
Waukesha City officials say VJS Development Group and Somerstone are proposing a redevelopment project that includes a mix of medical/office, multi-family residential, and commercial uses at the old Fox Run shopping center.
The 13.42 acre site has seen decline over the past 10 years with numerous vacancies including the entire north multi-tenant building and the restaurant space formerly occupied by Denny's, according to city officials say.
Redevelopment of the site isn't going to be cheap, and the developers asked the city to set up a Tax Incremental Financing district. The Plan Commission approved moving forward with a TIF District in late January.
Without the TIF district, developers said the project wouldn't be feasible due to the removal of buildings and parking lots, environmental cleanup, and utility work.
""Due to the extraordinary costs related to site preparation, the developer is requesting an estimated $3.7 million grant payment as tax increment is generated from the project (PAYGO). The City Contribution shall vary pro-rata depending on the completed value and date of completion. For example, if the increment value were to exceed the estimated $32,340,379, the PAYGO amount could increase or if the value ends up below that amount the PAYGO would decrease,"" meeting documents stated
Hey, What's A TIF District?
A TIF district is a development tool municipalities can use to attract business. Here's how it works: A financing district is created, and a base value of that district is established by the taxing jurisdictions. Over the years, it's expected that the property will increase in value. The increased value of the property is still charged at the base rate, but the district uses the increased tax revenue to pay for the infrastructure projects.
This means those taxing entities receive the amount of tax revenue they did before the district was created. During the life of the district, tax revenue on new development pays off the infrastructure costs."

They'll take up the matter again at 6:30 p.m. on March 3.
Under the proposal led by Tom Kelenic, Tim Neubert and Sonny Bando of Blue Ribbon Baseball, they would build a 43,000 square foot indoor health and wellness training facility geared towards the growth and development of youth athletes throughout Waukesha County.
According to a JSOnline report, Oconomowic officials put off their final decision on the stadium project after a public hearing where residents brought their concerns forward. According to the report, hours of operation, noise and traffic and lighting were all brought up as primary concerns by neighbors and others from the community.
Connected to the training facility would be a 2,500 seat open-air baseball stadium, home to a new summer collegiate baseball team.
""Since 2008, there has been a growing interest from community members and local governments to bring a collegiate wood bat organization to the area,"" Blue Ribbon Baseball officials said in a statement earlier this week. ""After nearly reaching an agreement in 2019, the support and desire for a team has grown even further.
Blue Ribbon Baseball's proposed facility would be located directly west of Wisconsin Harley-Davidson, on the southwest corner of I-94 and Highway 67."

Ted Cruz in Wisconsin - and it wasn't even close. Cruz garnered 61 percent of the vote. The eventual president collected a meager 22 percent of Waukesha Republican primary votes.
In a lengthy New York Times feature that profiles Waukesha County voters, President Donald Trump's support is stronger than ever.
The Times interviewed many Waukesha-area voters for their detailed report. One person, Marge Ingold, a retired business owner who once voted for Cruz, is now a firm Trump supporter.
""He's from New York, and I thought nothing good could come out of New York,"" she said in the Times. ""He believes what we believe,"" she said. ""He is standing up for the people.""

Am I Going To Be Kicked Off The Registered Voter Roll?
Wisconsin as a battleground state in the 2020 election is a fact that has been well-established. Now, two sides are fighting over about the status of about 230,000 registered voters in the state. One side wants to purge these residents from the state's voter rolls, saying they failed to update their address after moving - as required by state law. The other side says an imminent purge violates their constitutional right to due process, and wants to delay kicking anyone off the voter rolls for as long as they can.

The four phased plan calls for school and health officials to closely monitor coronavirus cases to decide if the district should go virtual, in-person or hybrid.
The plan calls for two options for families, virtual learning or phased-in learning.
Phase one's goal is for staff to become comfortable with the learning environment and safety procedures. Phase two is designed to have students comfortable with the learning environment and would have staff and students attending, phase three would be for the first week of school and would be a hybrid model, and phase four would be continued learning with options for virtual learning, hybrid learning, or classroom learning, depending on metrics outlined in the plan.
If metrics don't meet the standard held by the medical and health advisory panel for classroom learning, then students will go to virtual learning.

26,/wisconsin/waukesha/pence-turns-heat-biden-wisconsin-speech,2020-07-17T21:20:44Z,Pence Turns Up Heat On Biden With Wisconsin Speech,2,20,Associated Press,News Partner,"MADISON, Wis. — Vice President Mike Pence stepped up attacks on Joe Biden with an aggressive speech Friday in the birthplace of the Republican Party, casting the election in under four months as a choice ""between freedom and opportunity and socialism and decline.""
Pence, drawing sharp contrasts between President Donald Trump's vision for the country and that of Biden and other Democrats, said the election will determine ""whether America remains America ... or whether we leave for our children and grandchildren a country that's fundamentally transformed into something else.""
Pence's message in Wisconsin reflects a broader effort from Trump's re-election campaign and his allies to paint November in the starkest terms. It also highlights the core message the president appears to have settled on for the closing months of the campaign.
The speech, delivered on the campus of Ripon College in battleground Wisconsin, comes as polls show Trump trailing Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a state that Trump won by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Winning Wisconsin is key to both Trump and Biden's plans for victory.
Biden, for his part, also frames November as a fundamental choice, with his campaign's paid advertising and daily arguments casting Trump as fundamentally unfit for the presidency. Biden points repeatedly to Trump downplaying the coronavirus pandemic and stoking racial tensions amid a national reckoning with police violence against Black Americans and centuries of systemic inequalities. Beyond Republicans' usual framing of Democrats as tax-and-spend liberals, Pence's attack Friday on Biden was pegged in part to the Democrat's sweeping economic proposals, from making a government health insurance plan available to all working-age Americans to a $2 trillion plan to overhaul the nation's energy grid and reduce the carbon pollution driving the climate crisis.
Pence said that if Biden wins the election, the country will spin into economic decline, be less safe and have open borders and taxpayer-funded abortions. He accused Biden of having a ""radical agenda"" that will ""transform this country into something utterly unrecognizable.""
Pence said Trump, not Biden, supports law enforcement and will ""stand with African American families and all minorities to improve our quality of life in our cities and towns."" He called a recent rise in shootings and murders in some major cities a ""frightening preview of Joe Biden's agenda in action.""
""The hard truth is you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,"" Pence said.
Pence said Biden had aligned himself with ""socialist Bernie Sanders and the radical left wing of the Democrat Party.""
Pence referenced Ripon's place in history as the birthplace of the Republican Party, while invoking former Republican presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan in attacking Biden as someone who supports socialist agendas like the one of former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
""Their agenda is based on government control, our agenda is based on freedom,"" Pence said of Democrats.
Ripon is home to the "" Little White Schoolhouse, "" a national historic landmark that was built in 1850 and is recognized as the birthplace of the Republican Party. It hosted the first meeting of three existing political parties that formed the Republican Party.
Pence cast Trump's record before the coronavirus pandemic crippled the economy as an ""extraordinary three years of progress and renewal."" He said Biden would crush the economy with new clean energy regulations, move toward socialized medicine, open the borders, have taxpayer-funded abortions and work against school choice.
Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield countered that Trump's economic policies have ""harmed Wisconsin at every turn"" and that Pence glossed over Trump's economic record, both before the pandemic and since. As for casting Biden as a radical, Bedingfield was incredulous.
""That's a ludicrous argument, and I think they will have a very hard time getting that to stick to Joe Biden,"" she said, pointing to the candidate's long record of making deals as a senator and as vice president. The Pence visit came as COVID-19 cases were spiking in Wisconsin. Only about 50 people were allowed into the room where he spoke, with chairs set up so they would be at a distance. They had temperature checks before entering and were given a squirt of hand sanitizer. Ripon College policies require everyone in a campus building to have on a mask, and those who attended the speech complied.
Pence wore a mask when he entered the room but removed it for his speech.
Pence was also scheduled later Friday to tour a dairy farm in western Wisconsin outside of La Crosse and participate in a roundtable discussion with farmers. Trump won that congressional district by 4.5 points in 2016.

The Governor's Pardon Advisory Board heard from applicants via a virtual meeting on June 23.
""A pardon won't fix the challenges facing our criminal justice system, but it can have a tremendous impact on a person's life,"" Evers said in a statement. ""Each of these people earned a pardon by serving their sentence and making positive contributions to society.""
According to the Governor's office, Matthew Raasch, 41, was struggling with drug addiction when he cashed fraudulent checks to support his addiction.
Raasch, who now lives in Waukesha, volunteers his time to work with Waukesha County inmates and drug and alcohol treatment courts as a mentor to those struggling with addiction, authorities said.
The Governor's office also pardoned Andrew Ophoven on Thursday. Ophoven was arrested by three plain-clothed detectives for selling marijuana 20 years ago, officials said. He has since gone to school for culinary arts and hospitality management.
Ophoven, a Waukesha resident, said he hopes someday he will be able to own his own restaurant, according to information provided by the Governor's office.
The Wisconsin Constitution grants the governor the power to pardon people who have been convicted of a crime. A pardon is an official act of forgiveness that restores some rights that are lost when someone is convicted of a felony, including the right to serve on a jury, hold public office, and hold certain professional licenses.
Under state law, people convicted of a Wisconsin felony can apply for a pardon if they completed their sentence at least five years ago and have not committed any new crimes. Those currently required to register on the sex offender registry are ineligible for a pardon."

What he didn't expect, he told Patch, was that he would be sworn at by a board member.
Ben Strong said he went to the meeting that night to share his views on the topic of School Resource Officers — law enforcement personnel stationed at school that have a variety of public safety responsibilities.
Strong says he's collecting all the data he can to see if School Resource Officers are really the best option for local schools, or if they've had a net-positive effect on schools in Waukesha. Strong said it was his intention to present what he learned to the board, he told Patch. ""My opinion on this is subject to change, depending on what the data says.""
In a video shared with Waukesha Patch, Strong was shown walking up to the microphone to speak during a citizen comment period.
""How about instead of divesting $2 million dollars over the next five years towards school resource officers, you divest that money towards social workers,"" he said.
As he walked away from the microphone, the audio picked up a board member whispering an expletive under their breath. Only public officials and the then-empty citizen microphone were live.
Strong said he had a ""pretty good idea"" who made the comment, but didn't want to tell Patch because he wasn't 100 percent sure which board member it was.
""Calling people names, even if you don't know the microphone is on...there's just certain things you don't do,"" said Waukesha City Alderman Aaron Perry.
Ina CBS 58 report, Waukesha Ald. Aaron Perry said he was taken aback by the news. ""Calling people names, even if you don't know the microphone is on; there's just certain things you don't do,"" he said in the report. Waukesha School Board President Joe Como apologized for the incident, the report stated."

By Henry Redman
WAUKESHA COUNTY, WI — As calls to defund the police have spread across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department, most of the conversation has centered around large urban centers.
In Wisconsin, activists in Madison and Milwaukee are leading the charge. Milwaukee's Common Council has already proposed a 10% cut to the police department budget.
Part of the justification for these calls and proposals is the large proportion of the municipal budget that is spent on the police in these cities. The Milwaukee Police Department's $297.4 million budget is about 47% of the city's general fund.
But Milwaukee isn't the only municipality in the state that spends a large portion of its general fund on the police. In fact, 11 miles from Milwaukee, across the Waukesha County line, the Village of Butler spends a similar portion of its general fund on the cops — and spends more per capita on the police than the big city next door.
The role of the police in our society has been under a microscope since the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department in May. Local Policing is an ongoing series analyzing the culture, tactics and actions of departments big and small across Wisconsin. If you have a story to share about your local police, reach out to reporters Isiah Holmes and Henry Redman.
Milwaukee, with its population of just under 600,000, spends about $502 per person on the police. Butler, with its population of about 1,800, spent $572 per person in the village's 2020 budget.
Butler isn't the only small town that spends a lot of money on the police and many of the other big spenders are also Milwaukee suburbs. Statewide, Butler spends the 11th most per capita on the police while Milwaukee spends the 12th most, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum.
Ari Brown, a Wisconsin Policy Forum researcher, says police budgets do take up a lot of a municipality's operating costs, but that it's not that simple. Spending on education is not included in municipal budgets, so while the police might make up a large portion of the general fund, K-12 schools are typically the biggest local expenditure.
Additionally, maintaining a local police force comes with a baseline cost, so in a small town that will inflate the per capita spending.
""Just looking at what municipalities serve in their spending, once you remove things like school districts and utilities, there's not going to be a lot of big line items for spending,"" says Brown, the author of an analysis of police spending in Wisconsin. ""The police budget is going to make up a large portion of the budget.""
""You have a lot of these places people would consider suburbs, very small suburbs,"" he added. ""Small area-wise and population-wise, a per capita metric would inflate a little bit the importance. There are certain start-up costs to starting a police department. The need for some sort of police department, it's going to look like a lot.""
In 2020, Butler's police budget was $1,076,649. The village's total general fund was $2,344,100. But 93% of the police budget was to pay salaries and benefits for the department's eight officers and one administrative assistant.
Still, Butler spends a lot more money per person than the statewide average. The Wisconsin Policy Forum report found that from 1986 to 2018, per capita municipal spending on law enforcement in the state rose from $74 to $218.
Police spending was 17.8% of municipal operating and capital spending in 1986 and in 2018 that number was up to 20% (although it peaked at 22.1% in 2013).
Butler Village Administrator Kayla Thorpe says that although the department's staffing level might be high for the size of the village, it has to account for the large amount of manufacturing done there. She says nearly 10,000 people come to work in Butler every day and the police department must also respond to calls to those businesses.
Plus, some of the officers have been at the department for a long time, meaning they're high on the pay scale for the village's contract with the police union.
But the village also has a low amount of crime. In 2019, there were 72 reported crimes, according to Wisconsin Department of Justice data. This UCR offense number includes homicides, rapes, robberies, burglaries, assaults, arson and theft.
""Our staffing level is high but we do have quite a volume of calls for services,"" she says. ""We're a manufacturing community. While our residential capita is 1,800, there's nearly 10,000 people who come to work every day. We need to make sure we handle those calls for service. We have tenured officers who per union agreement have high costs. Our wage costs are at the max.""
Thorpe and Butler Police Chief David Wentlandt say the department has a great relationship with the community and people are happy with the services their tax dollars pay for. But that wasn't always the case.
In the mid 2010s, the Butler Police Department and its culture created a number of scandals.
The former police chief resigned after an investigation by the Waukesha County Sheriff's Office. That investigation found the chief used racist and sexist language with officers and that a number of officers — including the chief — watched porn on their work computers.
The sheriff's office report called the department a ""frat house.""
The village was forced to pay a $605,000 settlement because an officer was accused of beating up a man with disabilities during a traffic stop, court records show. Another officer was found having not completed or messed up nearly 150 police reports.
After these scandals, Wentlandt says the village's residents considered disbanding the police department and contracting with the sheriff's office for law enforcement services. But ultimately decided that they wanted their own police.
He says people wanted a police department that knew the names of the people in the community.
Thorpe says the village asked itself a lot of difficult questions and ultimately decided it could retain the department while fixing its culture.
""We had conversations with the community about what happened, how do we fix the issue and make sure it doesn't happen again?"" she says. ""What are the expectations our community has for our police department and government as a whole?
Amid calls to defund police departments, Thorpe says she doesn't think that will happen in Butler.
""I think if you were to ask residents, they're very happy to have a Butler Police Department,"" she says. ""They value having that local department where they know the officers on a first name basis. While we're very sympathetic to social injustices that are happening and understand the push in major cities to reinvest into community programs, I don't think that's going to happen here. We treat people with dignity. If that was different I'm sure we'd be having a much different conversation.""
Wentlandt says that when it comes to actually operating the police department and providing the services to residents, his budget is very small. After paying salaries and benefits he's left with a little more than $69,000.
Of that remaining money, he says a large portion of it goes to training his officers at least 40 more hours per year than the state required minimum. He also says he believes the concerted effort to fix the department's culture has been noticed by the community.
""I'm not embarrassed by where our budget is by any stretch of the imagination because I think it's easily justifiable by what we do,"" Wentlandt says. ""I don't think anything is way out of the realm in what we do. Salaries aren't exorbitant, we don't have fluff built into the budget, it's bare bones.""
Wentlandt also doesn't believe the community will request a major change to how the city handles public safety, but that his role is to protect and serve the people so if that's what they wanted he'd work to make it happen.
""I would be surprised if there would be a large contingent of residents who would say they want to reduce the budget for the police department,"" he says. ""We have demonstrated year over year, the value we're providing. Public safety is the number one drain on a budget. I would be surprised if people said we need to defund the police department or reduce the budget by X percent because of the value we've provided. But if that's the will of the people, we work for them. We'd have to find out a way to make that happen.""
Wentlandt says he hasn't gotten any calls or emails about the police budget and nobody has brought it up when he's out on patrol — because the department is so small the chief needs to be on the street.
But even though he hasn't gotten any comments, the village's residents are often participating in the full budget process. Thorpe says she thinks people are largely happy with the services the village provides. However in the last four years there has been just one comment at the village's public hearing on the budget, according to village meeting minutes.
Brown says that if a community wants to have a role in its local government, it needs to be involved in the budget process.
""It's just worth people being engaged and understanding these processes,"" he says. ""Village of Butler [has] just under 2,000 people, general fund spending is at $2.25 million, it's not an insignificant amount of money.""

""This WIFIA loan will provide the City of Waukesha with a new, safer source of drinking water from Lake Michigan, while saving the City approximately $38 million when compared to typical bond financing,"" said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler in EPA press release.
""In the past three years, the Trump administration has invested $38 billion dollars in clean water infrastructure, supporting 7,000 projects, and helping create 21,000 jobs across this great nation. I'm pleased that Waukesha's residents will now be assured of cleaner water for decades to come,"" Wheeler said in a press release.
The Great Lakes Water Supply Project will provide the City of Waukesha with a new, safer source for drinking water. The project includes the construction of infrastructure to obtain, store, and distribute drinking water from Milwaukee Water Works to City of Waukesha customers.
It also includes the pumps and pipes needed to return treated wastewater to Lake Michigan via the Root River, the release said.

""Waukesha's current water supply is severely drawn down and contaminated with naturally-occurring radium. Our Lake Michigan water supply project will ensure that our community can rely on a safe and sustainable water supply for generations to come,"" said Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly in the release.

This project will cost approximately $300 million, and EPA's WIFIA loan will finance nearly half of that figure. Wisconsin Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund loans will also fund a portion of the project costs. The WIFIA loan will save the City of Waukesha an estimated $35.9 million compared to typical bond financing. Project construction and operation are expected to create nearly 1,000 jobs, the release said.

Below is the number of poll workers needed in the following communities:
City of Wauwatosa (2)
Town of Delafield (2)
Town of Lisbon (4)
Town of Merton (5)
Village of Menomonee Falls (3)
Village of Nashota (5)
Village of Pewaukee (4)
City of Brookfield (8)
City of Muskego (20)
City of Pewaukee (57)
City of Waukesha (15)
""We know there are Wisconsinites looking for ways to serve their communities through this difficult time,"" Meagan Wolfe, Wisconsin's chief elections official, said in a press release. ""If you are a state, county or municipal employee, a teacher, a student or someone who is looking for temporary work, municipal clerks need you to step up and help right now.""
Wolfe said the commission is working closely with Wisconsin National Guard leadership on a request for soldiers and airmen to serve as poll workers in municipalities where critical shortages have been identified. The governor's office has not yet officially activated the National Guard to serve as poll workers.
""We know and appreciate that the National Guard is working on our request, but there is no guarantee they will be able to provide all or even some the personnel clerks need,"" Wolfe said. ""We understand the Guard is needed for other critical missions as our state deals with the COVID-19 pandemic.""
Wisconsin municipal clerks typically need between 25,000 and 30,000 poll workers to serve at polling places for an August primary. Because significant numbers of existing poll workers are in their 60s, 70s and 80s and have health conditions, there are experiencing shortages, Wolfe said.
The election commission has been surveying municipal clerks for the past month about their poll worker needs. Currently, clerks have identified serious or critical shortages of 938 poll workers in 153 municipalities.
Wolfe said the WEC staff has been working with clerks to refine and justify their requests for National Guard personnel.
Last week, the National Guard assisted the commission by distributing sanitary supplies, personal protective equipment and other polling place supplies to all 72 Wisconsin County Clerks, who are distributing them to the 1,850 municipal clerks. Enough surface disinfectant, hand sanitizer, and masks for poll workers have already been distributed to each polling place for both the August primary and the November General Election."

He came upon a person selling political signs along Highway 59, on the north side of North Prairie. The signs were something that would be seen at a county fair or a gun show, Perry said.
""This was a little bit extra. Signs were comparing (President) Trump to God,"" he told Patch.
One sign that took him by surprise read, ""Just Say No Sleepy Joe"" and included a derogatory term toward women to describe Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential running mate for Joe Biden.
Perry said as much as he sometimes disagrees with other political parties, he would ""never call someone that name let alone pay to have it put on a sign, then sell it for money to go towards a campaign.""
As a father, Perry said, he is concerned about the message it sends. He said he took his daughter to go golfing for the first time in North Prairie and she asked if it was OK for girls to play.
""Now there is a sign that says it is OK to call women a (degrading name), especially someone as decorated as Harris,"" Perry told Patch.
Perry added that if Democrats had inappropriate signs in Waukesha County, it would be a big deal.
He said that while his opponent, Rep. Scott Allen, doesn't have the authority over what people put in their yards, he should make a statement against the inappropriate sign since he has voters in the area. He added that Allen has a responsibility to set an example.
Allen's office emailed Patch on Tuesday morning with the following statement:
""I'm reminded of what my very first sales director used to tell me, she'd say, 'Scott if it weren't for poor taste some people would have no taste at all.'""
Perry said inappropriate signs are meant to motivate voters in the wrong way. ""I never considered any sign other than with my name on it,"" he said.
Perry encourages people to not rely on political signs to determine who to vote for. He recommends voters research each candidate on their ballot.
""We (candidates) are all over social media. My number has been public for eight years; I'm pretty easy to track down,"" Perry laughed."
34,/wisconsin/waukesha/court-appeals-reverses-waukesha-stadium-open-records-request,2020-09-17T19:20:03Z,Court Of Appeals Reverses Waukesha Stadium Open...,0,0,Karen Pilarski,Patch Staff,"WAUKESHA, WI— The Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed a 2018 decision in Waukesha County Circuit Court involving a denial of an open records request to the Friends of Frame Park. The City of Waukesha could be on the hook to reimburse the group for attorney fees which accumulated throughout the court process.
At issue was whether the court would consider assessing what amount of the group's lawyers fees and court costs are recoverable.
Friends of Frame Park formed in 2017 because its members—Waukesha citizens, property owners, and taxpayers— were interested in the city's plan to build and operate a baseball stadium in Frame Park in the City of Waukesha.
One concern of Friends of Frame Park was that the city might contract with private entities, Big Top and Northwoods League Baseball (Northwoods League), to run the stadium and its baseball team. Big Top owned several baseball teams and operated another stadium in Wisconsin; the Northwoods League owned the league in which these teams played, according to court documents.
The group was curious as to how taxpayer funds would be used and to what extent Big Top would profit from the project.
On October 9, 2017, the group submitted a public records request to Kevin Lahner, the city administrator, asking for copies of lease agreements between Big Top Baseball and or Northwoods League Baseball and the City of Waukesha. Two weeks later, the city attorney responded by letter, denying the request stating the contract was presently in ""draft form.""
In December 2017, Friends filed a suit for the draft lease then two days later the draft lease was released to them.
The city attorney's email explained that the document was ""being released now because there is no longer any need to protect the City's negotiating and bargaining position,"" court documents said.
The group decided to continue with the litigation. Friends filed additional requests on December 8, 2017, and on January 25, February 2, and March 6, 2018. The group also filed an amended complaint including some of these requests and addressing the impact of the city's December 20 disclosure of the draft contract, according to the lawsuit.
The amended complaint said that ""[t]he City's subsequent production of the withheld records that it represented as responsive to the October 9th request does not eliminate the violation at issue, which was the improper withholding of records based on the assertion of an invalid or inadequate exception and justification, or otherwise.""
The group asked the court to decide if the city's actions to withhold records in ""the face of the valid October 9, 2017 request"" was in violation of the Open Records law. They also sought litigation costs and attorney fees, the court documents said.
The city filed for summary judgment claiming the action ""was moot"" because the city had turned over all documents as requested and shouldn't be liable for the group's legal fees.
The court found in 2018 that the city released the draft contract not because of the lawsuit but because there were no longer any ""competitive or bargaining reasons"" for nondisclosure. For that reason, the court denied attorney fees and dismissed the action.
Friends filed an appeal in 2019. On Sept. 16, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals said in its decision, ""We hold that the City's reliance on the ""competitive or bargaining reasons"" exception was unwarranted and led to an unreasonable delay in the record's release.""
Plans for a $12 million, 2,500-seat ballpark for Mindiola Park struck out in 2019 due to lack of support for a funding source."

""In light of the events that have transpired this week in Kenosha, the senate will convene a special session of the legislature on Monday, August 31.
In addition to the series of bills that Governor Evers has asked the legislature to consider, Senator Wanggaard of Racine has released a package of bills aimed at increasing transparency and community involvement into law enforcement.
Combined with the newly-created Speaker's Task Force on the topic, there will be dozens of proposals that the legislature will work through in the coming months. I would also like to see legislation developed that creates enhanced penalties for violence perpetrated against police, firefighters, and EMT's.
The riots in Kenosha and Madison this week further demonstrated that first responders are performing their public service duties at great risk to their personal safety.
We look forward to a productive dialogue on how to improve law enforcement standards while at the same time ensuring police officers have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.""
Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times by Kenosha police Sunday during the course of a domestic dispute on the city's north side.
A witness to the shooting recorded the incident on video. In that video, police are seen following Blake around his SUV, grabbing him by the shirt, and opening fire on him several times as he enters his car while his children were apparently seated inside.
Blake survived the shooting. The video of Blake's shooting has gone viral, and Kenosha has seen widespread protests ever since.
Public officials of all kinds have weighed in on the shooting, some calling for immediate punishment for the officer who pulled the trigger, others for police and social reforms, and others who are calling for a playing-out of the police investigation into the shooting.

A Milwaukee woman took pen to paper to write a letter expressing her frustration over people not wearing a mask.
Kelly Hoglund spoke out on ""a terrible lack of adherence"" to pandemic rules and regulations in the City of Waukesha after a weekend visit.
Hoglund addressed a letter to Gov. Tony Evers, City of Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly, Waukesha County Sheriff Eric Severson.
""On Saturday, October 17, we attended the ""Shredded Cheddar Productions 2020 N PC Badger State"" competition held at the Waukesha County Expo Center. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Wisconsin becoming a ""hot spot"" for the virus in the country, both the organizers of the event and the Expo Center employees did very little to reduce or limit the spread of COVID-19 and my husband and I felt terribly at risk,"" Hoglund's letter said.
Hoglund attended a body-building and fitness competition called NPC Badger State, presented by Shredded Cheddar and Str8 Shredded.
Waukesha-based Shredded Cheddar Productions and NPC Badger State didn't return Patch's request for comment as of Tuesday afternoon.
Hoglund said there were a variety of signs at the Expo Center stating rules and requirements to limit the spread of the coronavirus. However, said the rules weren't followed by the center's employees, event organizers, 10 event judges, and attendees.
In Hoglund's letter, she pointed out the worst of the violations came from people not wearing face masks. Hoglund said at one point the emcee announced a person called the Waukesha County Sheriff's Office and reminded people to wear a mask if they have one. She said it was not her who called authorities.
""I can confirm that the Waukesha County Sheriff's Office did receive a complaint at the Waukesha County Expo On Oct. 17. As previously stated, Sheriff Severson, along with the majority of police chiefs within Waukesha County, will not be dedicating their finite resources to this issue,"" Lt. Nicholas Ollinger, Public Information Officer, with the Waukesha County Sheriff's Office said.
Hoglund said she was shocked and angered by a lack of basic decency and thoughtfulness during a global pandemic.
""This was a show celebrating those of us who can attain the heights of physical fitness, yet most people present (contestants, judges, and spectators alike) could not take basic care for their health or the health of others by taking the simple precaution of wearing a mask,"" the letter said.
Hoglund and others went out for dinner and drinks in downtown Waukesha and found people not wearing masks at two businesses. At one bar, Hoglund said two bartenders were not wearing masks nor patrons packed around the bar.
Teri Adlam, Manager at the Waukesha County Exposition Center, told Patch there are several inaccuracies with Hoglund's letter. Adlam said the arena building has a 250 max capacity it is currently running at.
""We are well below the 10%. We have been running very conservatively with our attendance. I've had to turn down about 75% of our business this year,"" Adlam said.
Adlam said her staff wears masks all the time indoors even not during events. Employees set out less than 250 chairs for events and are properly spaced. Sometimes people move chairs if they are in a group, which can't be stopped.
""We followed all the guidelines and held the attendance down,"" she said.
Adlam said staff is ""not really allowed"" to tell someone to wear a mask due to health record privacy laws. She told Patch, they can't ask why someone is not wearing a mask but can encourage it. Adlam added sometimes when the lights go out during an event, people will take off their masks.
""She (Hoglund) was correct there were people not wearing a mask, however they were socially distanced,"" Adlam said.
Adlam told Patch her staff is super cautious as they don't want to get sick.
""We know if one of us goes down, we could end up shutting down the facility and staff won't get paid,"" she said.
Adlam knows three people personally who have died from the coronavirus and safety is very important to her.
""I take it very seriously and so does my staff,"" Adlam said.
Hoglund and her husband, who live in Milwaukee, support many businesses that follow the masks and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
""Never in this pandemic have we felt so vulnerable and exposed as we did this past Saturday. I can only deduce that this lack of concern and care felt by the larger Waukesha community is coming from the top down,"" the letter said.
Evers also declared a public health emergency in September and extended a statewide mask mandate until Nov. 21. The order, which was in effect since August, was set to expire in September.
Under the original mask order, Wisconsin residents age 5 and older are required to wear a face mask when they are indoors or in an enclosed space, other than at a private residence, with anyone outside their family or living unit.
State officials said face masks also are strongly recommended if a person is outdoors where maintaining physical distancing is not possible.
The order also spells out exceptions to the requirement, listing activities such as when someone is eating, drinking, or swimming. People with health conditions or disabilities that would preclude the wearing of a face mask safely are also exempt from the requirement.
Hoglund addressed Severson in the letter.
""I wonder, if one of the attendees, organizers or competitors falls ill and, God forbid, dies from COVID-19, will you feel responsible?"" the letter said.
In July, Sheriff Severson made a statement on the mask mandate.
""The Waukesha County Sheriff's office will not be investigating, nor responding to, reports of violations of individuals not wearing masks pursuant to the recent order from the Governor,"" Severson said. ""As Sheriff, I must prioritize the use of law enforcement resources, and I am not inclined to use our finite resources on what is essentially a public health responsibility. This decision is also consistent with the great majority of police agencies in Waukesha County.""
Hoglund also personally addressed Reilly in her letter.
""Mayor Reilly, this lack of care for COVID-19 precautions runs rampant in the Waukesha community. If Waukesha becomes the newest hotbed of the spread of COVID-19 (I truly hope it does not), will you feel responsible?""
Mayor Reilly spoke to Patch on Tuesday and said the city doesn't have an ordinance that adopts Evers' mask mandate.
""Trying to have something that will stand up legally is very difficult because we don't have a health department. The county has a health department,"" Reilly said.
He added the way Evers' order was written, was for health departments. Without having one, enforcing the order becomes difficult.
On a personal level, Reilly believes everyone should be wearing masks in retail, restaurants, and any indoor place. He added the mandate allows people to remove their face coverings while they are seated and have begun eating and drinking.
Reilly also told Patch he doesn't go out that often Reilly just got married on Monday over Zoom.
He has a daughter who is immune-compromised and concerned about her.
""I don't want to go out and create what could be a major health problem for her,"" Reilly said.
He has had friends visit from around the United States who felt shocked at the lack of people wearing masks around southeast Wisconsin.

As of Tuesday, Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported a record 5,262 positive cases, bringing the total to 206,311. It is the first time more than 5,000 cases have been reported on a single day.
Reilly said wearing a mask during big events such as the one Hoglund attended over the weekend helps decrease the spread.
He added there has to be a balance between closing down businesses and people taking personal responsibility.

Air Force One still landed at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport on Saturday and was handled by the 128th Air Refueling Wing as usual. Harold Mester, Director of Public Affairs & Marketing, for the airport released the following statement:
""The Airport Director notified a tenant that holding any large special event that is non-aeronautical in nature would be a violation of its lease with Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport and would be in violation of the City of Milwaukee limit on public gatherings. The decision to hold this event was made without prior notification to the Airport Director, which is a requirement of each tenant's lease.

WAUKESHA, WI— President Donald Trump assured supporters packed shoulder to shoulder at a trio of rallies Saturday, including one in Waukesha, that ""we're rounding the turn"" on the coronavirus — despite spiking cases — and mocked challenger Joe Biden for raising alarms about the pandemic.
During a Saturday night rally at the Waukesha County Airport, Trump dug in on defending his administration's coronavirus response and quickly launched into attacks on Biden as the crowd chanted, ""Lock him up.""

Trump's visit to Wisconsin on Saturday concluded a busy day on the campaign trail.
The president, who spent Friday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort after campaigning in Florida, started Saturday by stopping at an early voting polling site set up at a public library to cast his own ballot.
Greeted at the polling site by a crowd of cheering supporters, Trump wore a mask inside, according to The Associated Press, and followed local rules in place to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
After casting his ballot, he told reporters that he voted for ""a guy named Trump,"" AP reported.
Later in the day, Trump held rallies in Lumberton, North Carolina, and Circleville, Ohio.
During his Waukesha rally, Trump told supporters the election is "" a choice between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression,"" the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
Trump reminded the crowd of Biden's comments from Thursday's debate on his hope to transition the country away from the oil industry.
""He's against oil,"" Trump said. ""He's against oil, guns and God.""

By Saturday, all but three of those states will have opened their polling places to the public.
Saturday is national Vote Early Day, a movement created by a coalition of nonprofits, businesses, election administrators and others to ensure every American has the chance to vote on or before Election Day.
Early voting, both in person and by mail, gives voters the chance to cast a ballot while avoiding crowded polling places and risking contracting the COVID-19 virus, according to the national Vote Early Day campaign.
Early voting in Wisconsin started Oct. 20 and ends on Nov. 1.
When polls are open varies by municipality and polling place. You can find the hours for polling places in Waukesha here: Waukesha voter guide.
Some states allow residents to cast mail-in ballots, which can be returned by mail, in a ballot drop box or to a voting place or election office. Here's where to find drop boxes in Waukesha.
In Waukesha, Absentee ballots may be returned:
If you still have your ballot on Election Day, it may be returned in person to your polling location by 8pm on Election Day, Tuesday, November 3rd.
The U.S. Postal Service recommends mailing back your absentee ballot by October 27 so it can arrive on Election Day.
The USPS recommends mailing back your absentee ballot by October 27 so it can arrive on Election Day.
Rules and regulations around voting vary by state. Here's what voters in Wisconsin should know before heading to the polls: Wisconsin Election Commission.
A Pew Research Center study found that more than half of voters in the 2020 presidential primary elections voted by mail in the 37 states studied, roughly double the number of voters who opted to use mail-in ballots in the 2018 and 2016 general elections.
The rise in mail-in voting parallels an overall increase in voter turnout in 2020. Thirteen days before the general election, voters had already vastly exceeded previous years' turnout rates with more than 40 million Americans having already cast a ballot.
This increase could be attributed in part to a handful of states that opted to automatically mail ballots to every registered voter and another dozen states that mailed absentee ballot applications to everyone registered.
In 19 states studied by the U.S. Elections Project, significantly more registered Democrats had voted than registered Republicans. As of Oct. 21, 52 percent of early voters who have cast a ballot so far are registered Democrats while 26.1 percent are registered Republicans.
Another 22 percent of voters had either no party affiliation or were registered with a minor party."

There was also a record-high 1,043 people hospitalized as of Thursday.
Farrow made the following statement:
""Last week, a member of my household developed COVID-19 symptoms and subsequently tested positive for the virus. As soon as they told me they were feeling ill, I self-quarantined and began working from home to avoid the possibility of spreading the virus in the community. A few days later, I also developed mild symptoms and was contact traced. Today I received a positive COVID-19 test.
""I have followed the recommendations of the CDC and utilized Waukesha County's Public Health infrastructure to stop the spread of COVID-19 outside of my household. The simple tools of self-quarantining, testing, and contact tracing are extremely effective, and I encourage all residents to use them if they begin feeling sick in order to protect our most vulnerable friends and family members from this virus.
""Everyone should follow Waukesha County's ""Stay Safe to Stay Open"" guidelines, by protecting the vulnerable, staying home when sick, social distancing, wearing a mask, and following CDC best practices.

""It is great to be back in the Badger state,"" Pence said. ""And I know this is Packers country with that 4-0 record, and judging by the flags and signs I saw on the way here, this is Trump country.""
While Pence was in Waukesha, the Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump's choice to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.
""I'll make you a prediction, Judge Amy Coney Barrett will soon be Justice Amy Coney Barrett,"" Pence said. ""We're going to fill that seat.""
Pence praised Barrett's character, intellect and faith. He argued the attacks on her faith ""must stop.""
Pence took aim at presidential candidate Joe Biden and said he would pack the court if elected by adding seats to the Supreme Court. He said Biden and running mate Kamala Harris were avoiding answering questions on the topic.
On Monday, Biden said during a televised event he was ""not a fan"" of adding seats but did not want to get distracted by the issue.
Pence spoke to a crowd outdoors, most of whom were not wearing masks or socially distancing.
The coronavirus pandemic has hit new records in Wisconsin. The state reported 3,279 new confirmed cases and 34 deaths Tuesday. The positive test rate was 22.6 percent out of 14,541 administered.

Pence said he spoke to the president and first lady before he got on the plane.
""They are doing just great. He is back on the road today,"" Pence said.
Ahead of Pence's visit, the Biden campaign released a news release on Monday:
""Today, Biden for President Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director Kate Bedingfield released the following statement on Vice President Mike Pence's trip to Wisconsin:
""During his time as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Vice President Mike Pence has demonstrated that the Trump Administration is woefully incapable of getting the coronavirus pandemic under control. President Trump has shown a reckless disregard for the lives and livelihood of the American people — and nowhere is that more clear than in Wisconsin.

As coronavirus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths surge across the state, the Trump Administration still doesn't have a plan to beat the virus.

If the public cannot attend the hearing, they are encouraged to submit comments on the budget by emailing: 2021BudgetComments@waukeshacounty.gov. Comments received will be distributed to the County Board of Supervisors.
County Board Supervisors have until November 4 to propose amendments to the budget. The budget is adopted at the board's November 10 meeting.
If the Waukesha County 2021 budget is approved, the tax rate will drop to the lowest level since 2009.
Waukesha County Executive Paul Farrow announced his 2021 executive budget to the Waukesha County Board of Supervisors in late September.
The budget invests in public safety and economic development while falling under the state levy cap and cutting the county tax rate for the seventh consecutive year. The Board of Supervisors is expected to pass the final budget in November, according to a news release.
""Our history of conservative budget practices and AAA bond rating has allowed us to weather the COVID-19 storm with little change to revenue,"" Farrow said in a previous news release. ""This budget supports Waukesha County's goals of creating a safe, economically vibrant community for residents while keeping taxes low. More than half of new tax levy will go toward public safety. Infrastructure projects geared toward long-term safety, efficiency and economic development are also heavily supported.""

If the budget is passed as-is, the tax rate will drop from $1.82 to $1.76 per thousand dollars of home value, the lowest since 2009.
The 2021 budget allocates a large portion to public safety, including $600,000 in new tax levy supporting the sheriff's department.

More than $330,000 will also support public safety programs, including emergency preparedness, which includes 911 dispatch and courts.
The budget also invests in infrastructure projects vital to the safety, economic development, and longevity of roads and facilities, like construction on Moorland Road and North Avenue, two of Waukesha County's most important corridors. The budget includes the necessary funding to complete phase one of the courthouse project, the release said.
The 2021 budget also continues to fund the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic at current levels, with continued leverage of federal funding as available to supplement operations."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Well, COVID-19, however, there isn't a legislative solution. Instead, it is vital that the people continue to have a voice in how government responds. When the executive branch imposes onerous restrictions on business which causes people to lose their livelihoods, then it is important that we impose our legislative oversight to curtail those regulations. When the executive branch refuses to pay attention to the needs of the unemployed, then the legislature as the voice of the people must bang on the doors of the administrative offices.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
My opponent supports abortion on demand with no restrictions even for late term. My opponent believes that the government should overrule parents and medical professionals in children's mental health decisions. My opponent believes that your right to bear arms should be taken away from you if people make unsubstantiated accusations about you.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
Three terms in the current office to which I seek reelection.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
Step one: do no harm. Statewide mandates as a means to combat local outbreaks are simply killing our economy. We can address local outbreaks with local mandates and keep the rest of our economy running. It isn't rocket science.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
By being an active participant, whether on the panel or not, in the recently announced Speaker's Task Force on racial justice and police reform. Additionally, I will be a voice to counter the radical ideologues that want to reshape American values in general while claiming the title of racial justice. They are wolves in sheep's clothing.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
Insisting on a proper education for our children. Protecting our rights and freedoms. Keeping Wisconsin competitive nationally.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
Even if people disagree with me, they will always get honesty from me, and I'm not going to change for the sake of political expedience."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
COVID19 and the economic recovery. I intend to actually spend time in Madison working to make sure the Wisconsin government doesn't continue to let down families, businesses and those in need.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I'm an proactive and pragmatic leader. I understand the urgent need for action to ensure public health through COVID19, and the real life economic knowledge to serve the people.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
In my 7 years on the common council I've spearhead, and passed, multiple initiatives and ordinances. These range but development/redevelopment, public safety, medicinal cannabis referendum and helping fund homeless services.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
Until the public health COVID19 crisis is under control, we will not see a full recovery. What we can do is enact cannabis reform that would fund a portion of the recovery. The state spends too much money on debt service from previous borrowing. Collaborating on addition revenue options is a more sustainable financial path than we've had.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
My diverse background is superior to my opponent's. I'm not beholden to anyone or special interests. Racial justice and police reform need pragmatic people who actually go to Madison and work together on these complex issue.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
Education, Gun violence prevention, women's rights.

Perry reached out to Patch last Friday to say he was waiting for test results and lost his sense of taste and smell. His son recently tested negative for the virus. The Freeman report said his son is now in quarantine and will be tested again.
Republican Rep. Scott Allen told Patch that Perry reached out to him on Tuesday to confirm his diagnosis.
""It is a sad day when anyone gets sick. I've been praying for him,"" Allen said.
Allen tested positive for coronavirus on Sept. 27. Allen told Patch he felt fatigued and had a sore throat which caused him to get tested.

Mike Crowley, the CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Waukesha County, received an absentee ballot meant for Caledonia on Friday.

Crowley said the United States Postal Service carrier placed the ballot, along with three other regular pieces of mail, in the mailbox.
""It was processed through Milwaukee USPS, then to Waukesha USPS, sorted, and the carrier placed it in our mailbox,"" Crowley said.
Crowley told Patch he believes it was human error and that the carrier ""failed to properly sort the mail.""
Crowley said he spoke with the Wisconsin Election Commission and they launched an investigation.
Waukesha County Clerk Meg Wartman told Patch she spoke with the post office. When the Milwaukee post office sorted the mail, the bar code mark went through the bottom portion of the address line and somehow the mail was misdirected, Wartman said.

Mike Crowley, the CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Waukesha County, received an absentee ballot meant for Caledonia. Crowley, who is also a Waukesha County Board Supervisor, posted on Facebook on Friday about the incident. The ballot was in a locked mailbox at the Habitat for Humanity headquarters in Waukesha.
Crowley said the United States Postal Service carrier placed the ballot, along with three other regular pieces of mail, in the mailbox. Crowley said he was shocked at what happened.
The ballot was from Racine County with a Caledonia address.
""It was processed through Milwaukee USPS, then to Waukesha USPS, sorted, and the carrier placed it in our mailbox,"" Crowley said.
Crowley told Patch he believes it was human error and that the carrier ""failed to properly sort the mail.""
USPS told Patch the media inquiry was forwarded to the Milwaukee communications office.
Crowley took the ballot to the Waukesha County Clerk for a discussion and to make sure it gets sent to the Caledonia Village Clerk.
""I'm a believer in each vote is like gold. It is critical that people are heard and one of the ways is to vote,"" he told Patch.
Crowley said he spoke with the Wisconsin Election Commission and they launched an investigation.
Waukesha County Clerk Meg Wartman told Patch she spoke with the post office. When the Milwaukee post office sorted the mail, the bar code mark went through the bottom portion of the address line and somehow the mail was misdirected, Wartman said.
""Somehow when it arrived at the City of Waukesha Post Office, no one caught it there. The carrier then delivered it to the Habitat for Humanity,"" Wartman said.
According to the Village of Waukesha, there have been three known mix-ups with absentee ballots. Democratic State Assembly candidate Aaron Perry told Patch a married couple in the same Village of Waukesha household received two different ballots. The ballots weren't printed incorrectly but the wrong one was mailed out.
One voter was mailed a correct ballot which has the 97th Assembly District race between Republican incumbent Rep. Scott Allen and his challenger, Perry. The woman's husband was mailed a ballot with a different race.
The Village of Waukesha Clerk at the time, Karen Couillard, emailed Patch to say the wrong ballot being mailed out was the result of human error. She submitted her resignation just over a month out from the Nov. 3 election, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.
According to the publication, clerk-treasurer Karen Couillard started the job in early September. Her resignation was accepted in a village board meeting Thursday night.
Couillard's resignation is set to take effect on Oct. 6.
Wartman said absentee voters are encouraged to check if they have the correct ballot by going to the website Myvotewi.gov. If the ballot is incorrect, call your local clerk.
Crowley is a proponent of in-person voting. He pointed out if a person opens up an incorrectly mailed ballot, the voter's confidentiality is at stake.
""All these advocates are saying absentee voting is a safe way to vote. Baloney,"" Crowley said.
He added the best thing to do is to send the ballot directly to your municipality clerk or the drop box.
Crowley said he is speaking out about the error because ""everyone's vote must be counted."""

In all seriousness, Allen said everyone's experience with the coronavirus is different and if there is an underlying medical condition. He told Patch he works out regularly, eats healthy and avoids bad habits such as smoking and drinking excessively. Allen added ""Don't take your health for granted.""
Perry reached out to Patch on Friday. Perry said he is waiting for test results and has lost his sense of taste and smell. His son recently tested negative for the virus.
Perry told Patch if he tests negative he plans to resume door-to-door campaigning. He said he will stay 12 feet away from people, wear a mask and have no literature with him.

Perry told Patch while it was just one ballot there could be possibly be more wrong ballots.
""It doesn't mean 300 wrong ballots were sent out. It just means you got one phone call,"" he said.
