Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Rep Joe Kennedy and the ACLU are among those calling for an independent investigation of an immigration detention facility after violence erupted during attempted coronavirus testing.
Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Friday night 10 ICE detainees at the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center ""rushed violently"" at he and correctional officers after the detainees were told they had to be tested for the coronavirus. Hodgson said the detainees each reported multiple symptoms of COVID-19, prompting the necessity for testing.
Hodgson said the detainees barricaded themselves in the the center's B-Wing, ""ripped washing machines and pipes off the wall, broke windows and trashed the entire unit."" They caused an estimated $25,000 in damage, he said.
Three detainees were taken to the hospital: One for a panic attack, another with a pre-existing condition and a third for ""a a medical incident after being removed from the ICE wing.""
No correctional officers were injured.
The Boston Immigration Justice Accompaniment Network was among those saying detainees reporting they were attacked by Hodgson himself and only wanted to be treated for symptoms in their own unit.
""All people held at this facility deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity,"" Kennedy tweeted, calling for an independent investigation.
""I'm concerned by yesterday's incident at the Bristol County House of Correction, & the conflicting accounts,"" Warren tweeted.
Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, called the reports ""deeply disturbing.""
""Immigration detention has expanded at record levels under the Trump administration; now more than ever, we will not allow the increasingly horrific conditions of ICE detention to be normalized,"" Rose said in a statement.

Social Security benefits are part of the retirement plan of almost every American worker. If you're among the people covered under Social Security, you need to know how much you might receive from us when you begin receiving benefits. These monthly payments may be a vital part of your retirement income.
We base your benefit payment on how much you earned during your working career. Higher lifetime earnings result in higher benefits. If there were some years you didn't work or had low earnings, your benefit amount may be lower than if you had worked steadily. Even if you have never worked under Social Security, you may be able to get spouse's retirement benefits if you are at least 62 years of age and your spouse receives retirement or disability benefits.
Our online retirement planners are a great place to start mapping out your retirement plan. You can access them at www.ssa.gov/planners/retire. We provide important information that you should know. Have you considered:
o When you should apply for retirement?
o What documents you need to provide?
o Which factors may affect your retirement benefits?
o What you should remember to do after you retire?
You can use our Retirement Calculator at www.ssa.gov/myaccount to get an instant estimate of your future retirement benefits, and to see the effects of different retirement age scenarios.
On our website, you'll also find our Retirement Estimator. It gives estimates based on your actual Social Security earnings record. Please keep in mind that these are just estimates. You can access the Retirement Estimator at www.ssa.gov/estimator.
Once you know your estimated retirement benefits, you can start coordinating other parts of your retirement plan. Saving money is also important. It's never too early to begin saving, and doing so can help you live more comfortably when you stop working.
Benefits for family members may also be important to you. When you start receiving Social Security retirement benefits, members of your family may also qualify to receive benefits on your record. You can learn more at www.ssa.gov/benefits. Please share this information with family and friends to help them prepare for retirement."

In March, our nation celebrates Women's History Month. Today, more women work, pay Social Security taxes, and earn credit toward monthly retirement income than at any other time in our nation's history.
Social Security has served a vital role in the lives of women for over 80 years. With longer life expectancies than men, women tend to live more years in retirement and have a greater chance of exhausting other sources of income. With the national average life expectancy for women in the United States rising, many women have decades to enjoy retirement. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a female born today can expect to live more than 80 years. Women need to plan early and wisely for retirement.
Our benefits planner website at www.ssa.gov/planners provides detailed information about how marriage, widowhood, divorce, self-employment, government service, and other life or career events can affect your Social Security benefit."

Biden finished with 38.6% of Swansea's 2,271 votes casts in the Democratic primary in unofficial results — ahead of second-place Sen. Bernie Sanders (26.2%), third-place former New York City Major Michael Bloomberg (13.3%) and fourth-place Sen. Elizabeth Warren (12.2%).
President Donald Trump easily beat former Gov. William Weld among the 765 votes cast in the Republican primary with Trump at 94.9% to Weld's 3.1%.
Biden rode a wave of weekend momentum Tuesday night to win the Massachusetts Democratic primary, crashing what had been expected to be a two-person race between Sanders and Warren. The Associated Press called the race for the former vice president just before 11 p.m.
Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden Wednesday morning. Warren was reportedly reassessing her run after a poor showing on Tuesday.
Super Tuesday Latest Results From Around The Country

Massachusetts had 91 Democratic delegates at stake Tuesday. Sanders made a late play to pry them from Warren, rallying in Springfield Friday and on Boston Common Saturday. But it was Biden who swooped in with an unexpected victory."

What do you see as our biggest priorities in Fall River for 2020 and beyond? Can we identify legacy issues? I believe, for example, that one legacy issue is streets and roads in Fall River.
Not the repairing of streets — we see construction going on everywhere. I'm thinking of the constant digging up of our streets and roads, even newly paved ones. Over the decades I have heard of many reasons why this is done: repair old sewer pipes, water pipes, electrical lines, etc. I was reminded of this constant tearing up of newly paved roads recently when a relative visited from out of the area. This relative lived in Fall River all of his life, lives nearby, and visits frequently.
He visited for Thanksgiving. His first words after holiday greetings were: ""I sure do not miss the numerous street bumps from the streets that were new on my last visit (several months previous) but now bumps are all over the place.""
There must be an answer to change our past practices. Where could answers be found? I don't think that we would have to look too far. It seems that every community surrounding has better streets and roads than Fall River. Even the more heavily populated and older communities, such as New Bedford, have better roads.
What are they doing that we are not? For starters, I would include Westport on any such task force, as they seem to have the best kept roads and streets and lanes locally. Maybe a Street Task Force convened by mayor-elect (Paul) Coogan could find an answer. If so, he would establish a legacy we all would celebrate for endless years. I wish all a Happy Holiday Season.

John Oliveira, 54, a disabled Navy veteran and a member of the New Bedford School Committee, put the fence up a few weeks ago.
Oliveira told Southcoasttoday.com, which first reported the story, that he started displaying a Trump sign on his lawn in late May. The first one disappeared in July.
In all, six signs were taken, he told The Boston Globe.
His latest sign has not been stolen since the fence went up.
""I'm defending my property and my right to free speech,"" he said.
The yellow and black solar-powered fence, purchased from a farm supply store, is about 3 1/2 feet high. It has warning signs in English, Spanish and French.
He has informed police of the thefts.
The fence is not pretty, he acknowledged.
""But I'm not going to not put a sign up because somebody keeps stealing it or somebody keeps taking it because they don't like what I'm saying,"" he said."

Visitors will use the entrance nearest to the new bath house beginning on June 26th.To insure adequate social distancing the Committee has followed recommendations to limit capacity at the facility thus parking will be reduced to approximately half capacity this season. Also, to minimize personal contact, only Season Passes will be available this season and limited to Swansea residents ONLY. There will be no daily passes. Residents are strongly urged to pay for the season pass ($15) with a check. Illegal parking will be strictly enforced.After much consideration and discussion with Town officials, it was determined that adhering to sanitation requirements for the bath house would be impossible and very costly, thus there will be no rest room facilities at the beach this season. Sanitation requirements for Porta-Jon's are more demanding eliminating their availability as well. Although 2020 will be a different season at the beach, the Committee is excited for residents to come and enjoy this beautiful facility despite the limitations. It has been a challenge that could not have been pulled together without the assistance of the Board of Selectmen and their office, Board of Health, Swansea Police Department, Swansea Fire Department, Waterfront Revitalization Committee, and the tireless hard work of the staff of the Highway Services Department and their Director.
