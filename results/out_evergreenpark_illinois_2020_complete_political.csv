April 28, 2020
Dear Governor Pritzker,
During this unprecedented challenge to our state, you stressed multiple times your willingness and eagerness to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle and from every part of the state. As the women of the House Republican Caucus, we stand ready to offer solutions and work with you to implement a safe and reasonable regional plan to open Illinois. We are business owners, scientists, mayors, lawyers, community organizers, volunteers, officers, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, caregivers, and legislators. We represent 880,000 Illinoisans across all regions of the state—from the Chicago suburbs to regions in northern, western, eastern, southern, and central Illinois.
Our family members and constituents are fighting on the front lines as healthcare workers. We know and love people who are diagnosed with and suffering from COVID-19. We know, love, and represent people who lost their jobs, closed their small businesses, and exhausted their savings. For us, this is not political. This is personal.
We asked many questions concerning IDPH modeling, PPE procurement process and inventory, IDOC policies for transfers and releases, issues at IDES, safeguarding Long Term Care Facilities, and protecting state facilities for veterans and the developmentally disabled. We made many suggestions to promote physical and mental wellbeing, including opening state parks, locking down our prisons, housing our homeless, and protecting our most vulnerable populations. You did respond to our request for IDNR to open our state parks, thank you.
Unfortunately, a majority of our questions and suggestions are not acknowledged. We reached out to you, but you have not contacted one Republican woman legislator to discuss our concerns, suggestions, or solutions. We are writing to tell you as a matter of record the House Republican Women are here for Illinois. We are ready to offer suggestions, strategies, and solutions; and we are calling for the legislature to reconvene. We want to do our job as essential employees for our state and want to work with you to safely and regionally reopen our state.
SAFELY
● As elected officials, we have a responsibility to all Illinois citizens. Our number one priority as wereopen Illinois is to protect those who are vulnerable to this virus and ensure they have the appropriate support and necessary resources.
REASONABLY
● Illinois needs a reasoned and common-sense plan to reopen our state region by region understanding the virus affects each region differently. Some of these common sense steps include:
RESPONSIBLY
● Our constituents deserve a responsible government—a government where there are effective checks and balances and a government where all voices are heard. A responsible government means calling the legislature back to session.
REGIONALLY
● One size does not fit all. We must safely open our state on a regional basis. Other states including New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa proposed measured, regional reopening strategies.
We, the women of the House Republican Caucus, ask you to work with us. We are prepared to work on a serious plan to reopen Illinois safely, reasonably, responsibly, and regionally. We request you meet with us collectively as a group to share our ideas and offer solutions. We must continue to protect our vulnerable populations and safeguard our healthcare delivery systems, while we must also save our economy and our families. We are prepared to assist in developing and implementing a plan to safely get Illinois back to business reasonably, regionally, and responsibly.
Finally, as members of a co-equal branch of government, we request you call a special legislative session to start work on reopening Illinois safely and regionally.
We are ready and await a meeting with you.
Sincerely,
Rep. Avery Bourne
Rep. Terri Bryant
Rep. Amy L. Grant
Rep. Norine K. Hammond

Rush Hearing Set For Jan. 3,0,5,Lorraine Swanson,Patch Staff,"CHICAGO, IL — A third-year University of Chicago law student running for Congress plans to bring in a handwriting expert to testify on signatures on Congressman Bobby Rush's nomination petitions for the upcoming Illinois Democratic primary. An evidentiary hearing is set for Friday, Jan. 3 at the Thompson Center before the Illinois State Officers Electoral Board. Rush has smiled a motion to dismiss.
Sarah Gad is hoping to boot the long-serving, Democratic congressman off the ballot based on Rush's petition sheets, which she maintains demonstrate ""a clear pattern of fraud or substantial noncompliance with mandatory provisions of the Election Code."" Gad is one of three candidates running against Rush in Illinois's 1st Congressional District.""
Gad claims that Rush's petitions violate Illinois election statutes and are replete with the errors — misnumbered pages, missing dates, signature inconsistencies — that if made by candidate running for the school board or other local office thrown off the ballot.
The congressman has dismissed Gad's allegations, stating she ""is desperately throwing out ridiculous requests"" based on minor errors that don't affect the integrity of his nominating petitions.
A records review took place last month. Subpeonas were served Dec. 30 to Rush's notary public Darva Watkins, and circulator Harvey Cook, who gathered signatures to place the congressman's name on the primary ballot.
Gad plans to call Watkins, whom Gad accuses of acting inappropriately in her duties as a notary public. The challenge sites inconsistent addresses for petition circulators, which Gad claims fail to match up with addresses on their ID, voter registration or both. Gad also states that some sheets appear to have been notarized absent of the circulator's absence and show invalid addresses.
Cook is expected to be questioned on why his signature appears to be different on various petition sheets and not matching the signature on his voter registration. To bolster her claims of tampering, Gad plans to bring in forensic handwriting expert Warren Spencer, who will testify on certain petition sheets circulated by Cook and others.
Even if the outcome goes Gad's way, Rush's legal council is likely to be appealed in Cook County Circuit Court. A final decision will be made before the board at a future date.
Illinois's 1st Congressional District spans Cook and Will counties, including Chicago South Side neighborhoods and south suburbs, encompassing all or parts of Evergreen Park, Oak Lawn, Alsip, Crestwood, Oak Forest, Orland, Tinley, Frankfort, Elwood and Manhattan."

Thompson Center where officers are expected to determine if Congressman Bobby Rush remains on the Democratic primary ballot who is facing a petition challenge.
University of Chicago law student Sarah Gad, one of three challengers who have filed to run against Rush in the Illinois 1st Congressional District primary, filed an 11-page motion last week asking the electoral board to rule against Rush remaining on the ballot. Gad claims that Rush's petitions are replete with errors, such as missing dates, addresses and page numbers, which are required under Illinois election statutes. The third-year law student has also presented evidence of inconsistent signatures, forgeries and notary misconduct which Gad claims demonstrate ""a clear pattern of fraud or substantial noncompliance with mandatory provisions of the Election Code.""
Rush filed a motion to dismiss on Dec. 17, arguing ""ballot access."" The state electoral board is expected to battle it out on Monday.
The 26-year incumbent congressman represents a district that spans Cook and Will counties, including Chicago South Side neighborhoods and south suburbs, encompassing all or parts of Evergreen Park, Oak Lawn, Alsip, Crestwood, Oak Forest, Orland, Tinley, Frankfort, Elwood and Manhattan.
Over the years, Rush has been the target of numerous ethical probes of his campaign spending, personal finances, delinquent tax bills and a non-profit he founded. The 73-year-old congressman's payments of $130,000 in campaign funds to family members, as well as rent-free political office space, have resulted in fines and wage garnishments.
ProPublica ranked Rush tenth in votes missed in Congress — 22 percent — which he attributed to caring for his late, ailing wife. Earlier this year, Rush accused Mayor Lori Lightfoot of having ""an alliance with the devil,"" and a $1 million grant to build a technology center in Englewood never materialized.
A Chicago attorney consulted by Gad's campaign, Tom Cross, who is not affiliated with either party, says the allegations hold merit and may spell trouble for Rush.
""Let me put it this way, I've seen candidates kicked of the ballot for a lot less. If it were any other candidate, yes, I absolutely think it would get them kicked off.""
Gad says they've spoken to ""many attorneys"" who noted inconsistencies in Rush's filing petitions to put his name on the March 2020 primary ballot. Gad's campaign also provided screenshots of Rush petition circulators Ricky Morrow and Harvey L. Cook Jr.'s signatures, which Abour alleges appear to have been forged on Rush's circulation sheets.
""We pulled every opponent's petitions and challenged only those that demonstrated a clear pattern of fraud or substantial noncompliance with mandatory provisions of the Election Code,"" Gad's campaign said in a written statement to Patch. ""Mr. Rush's papers demonstrated a clear pattern of both. They were replete with errors, missing signatures and dates, forgeries, notary misconduct, not to mention, 222 out of 332 of the pages were improperly numbered.""
Gad is a recovering opioid addict and former Cook County Jail detainee, where she claims she was sexually abused. Given a second chance and a job by civil rights and wrongful convictions attorney Kathleen Zellner, Gad applied her medical background as Zellner's forensics director. She is a volunteer with the Chicago Community Board campaign to end cash bail and has founded an organization called Addiction 2 Action that works to raise awareness about the need for better opioid treatment in jails and prisons.
Gad said in a written statement that the objection was nothing personal and that she would simply like to see integrity restored to the electoral process.
""We can't continue to allow politicians to cut corners and then cry foul when they don't show up and do their jobs,"" she said.
Rush's campaign manager, Mary L. Datcher, responded to the Hyde Park Herald's questions of possible technical flaws on Rush's petitions, calling it a ""direct strategy to gain name recognition and media speculation by Ms. Gad in challenging our petitions.""
Also challenging Rush in the upcoming Illinois 1st Congressional District Democratic primary on March 17, 2020, are gun control activist Robert Emmons Jr. and Ameena Nuur Matthews.

Sen. Bill Cunningham, an Illinois Senate Democrat, supported the overhaul of Illinois' archaic school funding formula. The new formula will have pumped more than $7.6 million in additional money into schools in the 18th State Senate District during its first two years on the books.
""Superintendents are making meaningful changes in schools and classrooms across the southwest suburbs because of the new formula,"" Cunningham said in a news release. ""Schools that have gotten the short end of the stick for years are moving to the front of the line for support, and that's how it should be.""
Statewide, many school districts are rehiring teachers and counselors who were laid off because of budget constraints, reinstating vital programs, creating innovative new learning programs, and establishing much-needed stability so they can budget for the future.
Under Illinois' evidence-based model, no schools receive less money than they did the previous year, and last year's new money becomes part of the current year's base funding minimum. This allows long-underfunded schools to achieve adequate funding over time without penalizing schools that have already had adequate funding.
For example, last year – the first year under the new formula – Chicago Ridge District 127-5 received $1.2 million in new, additional state money. This year, more than $923,000 will be added to the district's total for 2018-2019 under the formula, bringing its total state funding for the academic year to nearly $9.6 million.
North Palos School District 117 received more than $620,000 under the new formula last year. This year, more than $1.3 million will be added to the district's total for 2018-2019 under the formula, bringing the district's total state funding to more than $11.1 million for this school year.

The deadline for homeowners in the following suburbs to file a property tax appeal is Monday, July 23, 2018, including these communities:
Appealing your home's assessed value is the only way to achieve property tax relief on your second installment property tax bill in July 2019, other than selling your home or claiming a new exemption. Assessments can be appealed every year, regardless of when a township was reassessed.
The Cook County Assessor's office encourages all homeowners to appeal to ensure fairness because they have publicly acknowledged that their initial assessments may not accurately reflect your home's fair value.
According to Kensington Research and Recovery, a Cook County property tax consulting company, homeowners can appeal directly with the Cook County Assessor via the assessor's website. However, unless you have thoroughly researched comparable properties (aka ""comps""), which are the most similar homes to yours, you may only win a reduction of hundreds of dollars while foregoing a reduction in the thousands.
A more comprehensive review of comps by an experienced third-party, especially one that purchases all home assessment data from Cook County as it becomes available (three times per year), can reveal a much more persuasive analysis that could lead to a reduction in the thousands.

Bruce Rauner, state Rep. Kelly Burke (36th District) is urging the governor to sign a measure into law the will expand grants for low-income college students.
""Education can help people improve situations for themselves and their families,"" Burke said in a news release. ""We as leaders in this state need to do everything in our power to establish access to education and to make sure the dream of a college education is one that is not exclusive to the wealthy.""
The Evergreen Park state lawmaker is the chief co-sponsor of HB 5020, a measure that prioritizes students currently receiving funds from Monetary Assistance Program, or MAP grants, to continue their college education. Students that remain eligible for MAP and renew by the established priority deadline each year would receive the grant as long as the program is funded.
""In the wake of the uncertainty created by the recent budget impasse, we need to offer as much positive assurance as we can to students and parents,"" Burke said. ""By making the process to receive MAP easier, colleges and universities in Illinois will be able to provide more certainty to prospective students regarding their financial aid packages, which could also help our schools to be more competitive with out-of-state institutions.""
House Bill 5020 passed both the House and the Senate without opposition and is expected to be sent to the governor for approval in the near future.

Kelly Burke (36th District) is hosting a book drive May 1 through 15 to collect both fiction and non-fiction books for female inmates at two local detention centers. Many inmates in women's correctional facilities are facing a critical lack of education resources. Residents are asked to drop off donated books at her district office in Oak Lawn.
""It is important that those who are incarcerated are provided educational opportunities that will build relevant skills once they are released; and for many, this education is provided through books borrowed from the jail's library,"" Burke said. ""If we provide more diverse opportunities while people go through rehabilitation in the system, they will be more prepared to be functioning members of society when they ultimately are released and face a lower risk of ending up behind bars again.""

Burke and co-organizers will be collecting lightly used books for the book drive from May 1 to May 15 at Burke's office, located at 5144 W. 95th St. in Oak Lawn. At its completion, the books will be donated to the libraries of both the Logan Correctional Center and the women's division of the Cook County jail.
Acting Warden Glen Austin at the Logan Correctional Center said he welcomes the new additions to the prison library. Austin said he plans to establish satellite branches in the residence building to make access to books even more accessible.
""As a former high school teacher who volunteers at Logan Correctional Center, I frequently hear how important books are to the women housed there,"" said Ron Browne, a constituent of Rep. Burke's. ""Bringing these literary options to women who are often forgotten about in the mainstream brings smiles to their faces and insight to their minds. I thoroughly enjoy making someone's day by bringing a book that expands their thoughts and their opportunities once they are released.""
Cook County Correctional Officer Mary Kim McCormick, who also volunteers with inmates, says a lack of reading material for detainees has always been an issue.
""With the new options that we bring, I think we will be able to show inmates different paths to living a successful life after they get out of the system,"" McCormick said. ""I spend a good amount of time with the inmates here at the women's division of the Cook County jail, and a lack of substantial reading materials has always been an issue. That is why we are here to help.""

It is disgusting and infuriating that the President remarks about immigration from ""shithole countries"" like Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries come on the eighth anniversary of the Haitian earthquake in which more than 200,000 people were killed.
Is the President not aware that immigrants of all races, nationalities, and religions built this country?

Everyone should condemn the racist remarks made by the President, especially those who were present in the meeting. Their silence is deafening. I commend Senator Dick Durbin for giving truth power.
We cannot continue to let this dangerous President erode this country's reputation. We must stand up for our nation's values because it is clear President Trump will not.

State Rep. Kelly Burke (36th District) helped pass IL House Bill 3298. The bill became law last month.
""As a parent, I believe we have an obligation to ensure our children have access to a high-quality education,"" Burke said in a news release. ""Our children's education should not stop when their teacher is sick or unable to be in the classroom, which is why we must reduce the burden for highly qualified individuals to become substitute teachers.""
HB 3298 waives the $50 renewal fee charged to teachers reapplying for a substitute teaching license if they have taught ten full schools days throughout the previous year. The measure also allows new applicants for a substitute teaching license to receive a refund for the license fee if the applicant has taught at least ten days within their first year of teaching.
""We should not be nickel and diming hardworking teachers who are trying to make a difference,"" Burke said. ""I am thrilled we are providing some relief to educators across our state and I will continue fighting for our teachers and students.""

Burke Joins Sexual Harassment Task Force,0,0,Lorraine Swanson,Patch Staff,"EVERGREEN PARK, IL -- Harvey Weinstein. Roy Moore. Bill O'Reilly. Charlie Rose. As women in Illinois and across the country continue to find their voice and demand an end to sexual harassment and discrimination, state Rep. Kelly Burke (36th District) was appointed serve on the Illinois State House's newly created Task Force on Sexual Discrimination and Harassment charged with researching new policies that will combat harassment in both state government and the private sector. The task force is set to meet on Nov. 29.
""It is clear we have a problem in our country when it comes to sexual harassment and discrimination, and we must take action to change our culture,"" Burke said in an announcement about her appointment. ""As a mother, I want my daughters and all young women to know they have the right to live and work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination.""
Burke joined her colleagues earlier this month to pass legislation creating a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of the legal and social consequences of sexual discrimination and harassment in both the public and private sector. The task force will make recommendations to the General Assembly to combat this behavior. A similar task force has been established in the Illinois Senate.
A letter circulating Springfield was signed by 130 legislators, lobbyists, attorneys and directors of nonprofit groups, described crude jukes, unwanted groping and widespread harassment involving male political candidates and those in legislative leadership positions.
Illinois State Senator Ira Silverstein was forced to step down from the Senate Democratic leadership team last month amid sexual harassment allegations against him. Debra Rotheimer, an Illinois lobbyist and a GOP candidate for the state house in Grayslake, alleged that Silverstein used ""tactics"" and ""mind games"" to invade her privacy and personal space. Most of the alleged harassment came through private messages on Facebook and texts.
""I think [the Illinois General Assembly] is taking it seriously,"" Burke said. ""We shouldn't only be looking at what goes on in government but other industries.
An eye-opener for Burke was a conference she attended last year about sexual harassment in the hospitality and restaurant industry, which resulted in the ""Pants On, Hands Off"" study and campaign.
""The results were absolutely shocking about what women in these industries encounter,"" Burke said. ""A lot of the issues we've been talking about we have the voice and power to highlight and address these in the government sphere. Most women who experience this type of harassment felt they weren't being heard.""
About 40 legislators have signed on to the task force, Burke said. Included are large number of male legislators. Burke thinks her male colleagues' intentions are sincere, not because an election is coming up.
""There will be an opportunity to have numerous voices,"" she said. ""I got a lot of thoughtful, caring guys in my life who've never done this who are appalled. I think the vast majority of men are concerned about this as well and want it stop. They have mothers, sisters and daughters.""
Burke is on record for cosponsoring a package of legislative measures to crack down on sexual harassment in state government, ensure offenders are brought to justice, and that steps are taken to continue combating workplace discrimination and harassment in both the public and private sector. She also supported legislation ensuring that the newly appointed legislative inspector general has enough time to complete investigations of all complaints pending, despite a one-year statute of limitations.
""I would love to be able to be part of an effort that can really find some profound ways to bring attention to the problems of sexual harassment and reduce it,"" Burke said. ""I'm a female working an arena where there are lots of men. I have two daughters, I wouldn't want them to experience this in school or the workplace. I'm doing this for our girls.""
The jury is still out whether or not sexual harassment and abuse can be eliminated -- or at least severely curtailed -- from the workplace and schools. Burke thinks the task force is a good start.
""Are we gong to eliminate it, probably not,"" she said. ""I think the awareness and the opportunity for people to reflect on how they treat others in the workplace and recognize that some behavior or comments deemed unwelcome from co-workers is going to be a plus. Are going to stop the next Harvey Weinstein, I don't know.""

Are you buying sweetened beverages, and maybe even your groceries, outside of Cook County? State Rep. Kelly Burke (36th District) and State Sen.

""With an honest, balanced state budget in place for the first time in years, I am focused on moving our state forward and healing the damage that the governor's budget crisis has been done to our social service agencies and higher education system,"" Burke said in a news release. ""I want to use this opportunity to speak with residents one-on-one to discuss the difficult choices we made in Springfield and push back against the fake news being spread by those who back the governor.""

The Evergreen Park state lawmaker is inviting residents to stop by and discuss local and state issues in a casual setting. Burke is also fighting to repeal the Cook County beverage tax and will be collecting signatures at her event in support of legislation to outlaw this unfair tax. She believes this tax unfairly impacts middle-class families and seniors and will jeopardize local jobs. The county's tax raises the average cost of a 2-liter soda by 67 percent, and raises the average cost of a bottle of fruit juice or iced tea by 43 percent.

""Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, this tax unfairly hurts middle-class families and seniors on fixed incomes,"" Burke said. ""I am also concerned the beverage tax will hurt small businesses and force people to shop outside the county. If you agree we need to can this tax, I am encouraging you to stop by and sign my petition repealing it."""

The bipartisan budget that Burke supported includes $327 million for the MAP Grant program. Included in release of funds is $6.6 million for Saint Xavier University in Chicago and $1.7 million for Moraine Valley Community College in Palos Hills to cover the MAP grants.
""We at Saint Xavier University appreciate Representative Burke and the other legislators' dedication to Illinois students and their commitment to ending this budget crisis"", said Laurie Joyner, president of Saint Xavier University.

Ten states already have a similar law: Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
The bill would allow people under 21 to drink in restaurants, but not bars, stipulating those 18 and older could drink ""on premises where a restaurant is operated and the sale of alcoholic liquor is not the principal business.""

Illinois voters put 20 electoral votes in Biden's pocket on Nov. 3.
In 2016, Hillary Clinton won Illinois's 20 electoral votes over Trump by 16.9 percentage points. With approximately 90 percent of the state's votes counted in 2020, unofficial vote tallies show Biden overcoming Trump by 13.2 percentage points, according to the Washington Post. The results are taking longer this year because of the large number of mail-in ballots.
Illinois has voted Democrat in the past six presidential elections. Barack Obama won by 16.9 percentage points in 2012. Most of the state's Democratic votes are clustered around Illinois's urban centers, such as Chicago, Springfield and Metro East, where some St. Louis suburbs spill across the Illinois-Missouri border.
The last time Illinois voted red during the 1988 presidential election between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, ending a Republican electoral winning streak of six presidential elections in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1988.
So how did Trump's support in Evergreen Park compare with his vote totals in 2016, when he was running against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Trump picked up four more votes in 2020 than Evergreen Park voters gave him in 2016. Clinton did better four years ago than Biden did in 2020, snagging 656 more votes.
Here is a precinct-by-precinct comparison of how Donald Trump fared in 2016 and 2020.

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Evergreen Park and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in the 2016 election, working with ProPublica to bring you information on broken scanners and long lines at the polls in Brooklyn, the extension of voting hours in Durham County, North Carolina, due to technical issues, voting improprieties in Texas, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and much more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:

Find a convenient location near you on the Cook County Clerk's website. Early voting sites will be open during the following hours:
Mail-In Ballot Drop Boxes: The drop boxes will circumvent the USPS as the mail ballots will be securely delivered directly to the clerk's office, according to its website. Voters can drop off their completed mail-in ballots between 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday through Nov. 2, the eve of the election, at the drop boxes located at early voting sites in Cook County. Mail ballots will be collected on a daily basis and will be time stamped. In addition, an election judge will be monitoring the drop boxes throughout the day.

The last day to register online is Oct. 18. If you miss both voter registration deadlines, you may still register to vote during the Grace Period or on Election Day.
Grace period registration and voting extends the registration period by allowing voters to register and vote up until Monday, Nov. 2, the day before the presidential election. Voters may register to vote during the grace period at any Cook County early voting location, but must cast their vote immediately upon registration.
Voters may also register to vote in person on election day, Nov. 3, but only at their home precinct.
Early voting started Oct. 19 in suburban Cook County. A full list of early voting sites for Cook County suburban residents is available on the county clerk's website. A list of early voting sites for Chicago residents is available on the Chicago Board of Elections website.

Candidates interested in running for village board offices have until Dec. 21 to submit the nominating petitions to get on the ballot next April. So far, no one else has filed.
A historic first for Evergreen Park, the slate is led by two women — mayoral candidate Kelly Burke and Cathy Aparo, who is running for another term as village clerk. Rounding out the ticket are Mark Phelan, Carol Kyle and Norm Anderson, who running for reelection as village trustees.
""This is such a good group of people,"" Burke said. ""I'm excited for the challenge and opportunity. I've lived in Evergreen Park for 27 years. I have raised my three kids here and have loved living here.""
>>> Mayor Sexton Surprises Many With Retirement Announcement
Mayor Jim Sexton stunned residents last week when he announced his retirement after 20 years as mayor, and prior to that 20 additional years as a village trustee and clerk serving under Mayor Anthony Vacco. Sexton has endorsed Burke for mayor.
""Kelly Burke is an incredibly talented lady,"" the mayor told EP Podcast. ""She's an attorney, she's our state representative. She's been around the block. She will know a lot of people and be able to help us a lot because of all her connections in Evergreen Park.""
For the past 10 years, Burke has served as state representative representing the 36th District in the Illinois General Assembly. She was elected as trustee on the Evergreen Park Village Board in 2019. Burke said she would continue to hold her seat in the Illinois State House if elected mayor.
The Illinois State Constitution allows legislators to hold multiple state or local offices. However, when the Illinois General Assembly is in session or the member is performing other official duties, such as committee meetings or public hearings, the legislator may not draw compensation from the other local or state elected office.
""If in Springfield, I would not get paid for that day as mayor. My pay [from the village] would be prorated,"" Burke said. ""I would be in contact with the village every day I'm in Springfield.""
Evergreen Park operates under a mayor-council form of government, where the mayor acts as the full-time chief executive officer, as opposed to hiring a village or city manager to run day-to-day operations.
The burning question of many residents is how Burke, plans to hold dual offices.
""I already have more than two jobs. I am an attorney and I teach a class at Loyola Law School,"" Burke said. ""I'm used to being extremely busy, and I'm good at multitasking.""
If elected mayor, Burke said she would resign from her job at a law practice. She will not take a pension as mayor and does not participate in the General Assembly's pension program.
""It's important to keep in mind that the state legislators do a lot of different jobs,"" she added. ""I have colleagues who are coal miners, professors, firefighters. The breadth of experience you bring in is important. I think that part strengthens us.""
As state representative, Burke collaborated with Sexton and Ald. Matt O'Shea in Chicago's 19th Ward on their shared problems with stalled CSX trains blocking street-grade crossings.
""I was able to work with Jim and Matt on the lawsuit against CSX with [Chicago's law department],"" Burke said. ""We put the pressure on CSX. It's not perfect, but it is better than what it was.""
Bringing the local economy back after the pandemic, particularly the village's bars and restaurants, would be one of the village board's biggest concerns.
""That's part of the fabric of this community,"" she said. ""When things get back to something approaching normal as the vaccine trickles down, people are going to be going out in confidence to bars and restaurants again.""
Should she win next April, Burke would become Evergreen Park's first female mayor. She knows she has big shoes when Sexton leaves.
""What I'm hearing is that people feel the mayor personally cared about them,"" Burke said. ""One of my strengths is that I do think I'm a people person. If you're going to be in public service, you should really like people and have that personal connection to the village that Jim has."""

Sexton also endorsed State Rep. Kelly Burke, also a village trustee, for mayor in the April 6, 2021 election.
Although rumors of his retirement had been swirling around for the past month, Sexton's announcement Thursday surprised some people.
Sexton was elected mayor in spring 2001, succeeding Anthony Vacco, who had served 33 years as mayor of Evergreen Park. Prior to that he spent eight years as a village trustee and six as village clerk. In 2012, he was hospitalized for more than a month with West Nile Virus.

>>> Listen to Sexton's full interview on EP Podcast
""You always know when it's time to hang it up,"" Sexton said in conversation with EP Podcast. ""Karen [his wife] and I had talked about it for some time. We thought this was a really good time. We have an incredible team still on the field.""
Sexton ushered in an era of re-development that included the Evergreen Plaza and Evergreen Country Club. The village was able to attract big box and department stores to 91st and Western, while preserving 51 acres of the land tract as green space.
While he doesn't like making endorsements, Sexton said he would support Burke's run for mayor next April. Burke was elected as a trustee to the Evergreen Park Village Board in 2019.
""Kelly Burke is an incredibly talented lady,"" the mayor told EP Podcast. ""She's an attorney, she's our state representative. She's been around the block. She will know a lot of people and be able to help us a lot because of all her connections in Evergreen Park.""
Burke plans to keep her seat in the Illinois House should she be elected mayor. Sexton said Village Clerk Cathy Aparo and village trustees up for reelection also plan to run. Filing for the April 2021 Consolidated Election begins next Monday. It is not yet known if seats will be contested.
Sexton will finish out his current term, which expires in May when the new board is sworn in. Meanwhile, he has one more economic development trick up his sleeve, and would like to see a brewery take up shop in Evergreen Park."
