A new app to be unveiled Thursday will provide Angelenos with early warning for quakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater in Los Angeles County.
It is the nation's first public early warning system, and it could be a major lifesaver. The app is part of a pilot program with the U.S. Geological Survey, AT&T and The Annenberg Foundation.
""Earthquakes are a matter of when -- not if. We're officially launching #ShakeAlertLA tomorrow, and today you can become one of the first to use our early warning technology,"" according to a statement on Mayor Eric Garcetti's Twitter account.
The ShakeAlertLA app will be officially unveiled at City Hall Thursday, but you can already download the app on many mobile phones at Mayor.LA/3pwx30nakMm.
Designed to save lives by giving people time to head to safety before major building damage, it remains to be seen just how much, if any, warning residents will get.
""ShakeAlert is NOT a prediction that an earthquake will occur. It signals that an earthquake has started and you may feel shaking. This app is meant to help provide alerts for your safety,"" according to the app.
The mobile app is designed to provide advance notice that an earthquake is about to strike through a text or other electronic means. It works with the system known as ShakeAlert, which is based on a network of in- ground sensors developed by USGS to detect seismic activity.
""You may receive the alert before, during or after shaking,"" the app tells users. ""Take protective action as soon as you receive an alert or feel or hear an earthquake. Drop, cover and hold on.""
The City Council in June approved the negotiation of a $300,000 contract with AT&T and the GRYD Foundation for the design, creation and deployment of the Early Earthquake Warning System Mobile Application.
In addition to providing quake alerts, the app also includes tips on preparing for and recovering from a quake. It also includes a listing and map of recent quakes.

1,/california/belmontshore/rep-alan-lowenthal-denounces-supreme-court-over-gerrymandering,2018-06-19T17:40:38Z,LA County Rep. Denounces SC Over Gerrymandering,0,0,California News Wire Services,News Partner,"LONG BEACH, CA – Rep. Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, decried U.S. Supreme Court rulings on gerrymandering cases Monday because they did not address the merits of the arguments against district maps in two cases.
""While I am disappointed in the overall ruling, I am hopeful a reconsideration by the lower court in Wisconsin will lead to a decision, either in Wisconsin or at the Supreme Court next year, on the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering,"" Lowenthal said.
""I truly believe that voters should pick their politicians, not the other way around. Voters should be guaranteed choices at the ballot box, not treated like political pawns to keep entrenched power embedded.
""Guardrails must be put on the redistricting process, otherwise, politicians will take advantage of the system and the result will be a continuation of the unfair, unconstitutional practice of gerrymandering.""
In September, Lowenthal was among 25 current and former House members – 17 Democrats, seven Republicans and former Rep. Tom Campbell, who was a Republican when he served in Congress but switched his registration to No Party Preference in 2016 – who filed an amicus brief in the Gill v. Whitford case the high court ruled on Monday.
Lowenthal was also among 34 current and former House members – 18 Democrats and 16 Republicans – filing an amicus brief in the Benisek v. Lamone case, which was also ruled on Monday.
In both cases, the high court kicked the cases back to lower courts to consider various issues with the lawsuits as they stand. Gill v. Whitford challenged Wisconsin's redistricting, but the justices ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to bring their case, but were allowed to return to the lower court to show they have the right to bring the lawsuit.
""I am pleased that the highest court in the land has unanimously reversed the trial court's erroneous decision invalidating Wisconsin's Assembly map,"" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said. ""Today is a win for the rule of law in Wisconsin.""
In the other lawsuit, a challenge was made to remapping of one congressional district in Maryland, but the justices unanimously ruled the challengers had waited too long to seek an injunction blocking the district, which was drawn in 2011.
Lowenthal argued that the congressional maps drawn following the 2010 census were ""some of the most partisan ever devised,"" and added that the rulings do ""nothing to prevent political parties from gerrymandering.""
Lowenthal told City News Service there isn't much Congress can do in the meantime, and expressed concerned that time was running out with the 2020 census looming that would affect how districts will be drawn in 2021.
""While I am disappointed in today's ruling, I recognize that there are still a number of promising developments that can still address the issue of gerrymandering before the 2020 decennial census and the next round of political redistricting,"" Lowenthal said in an emailed reply to questions from City News Service.
""Of these opportunities, sadly, the least likely to lead anywhere is through Congress. While there are some pieces of legislation addressing partisan gerrymandering, including (a resolution) co-authored by myself and Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, current Republican leadership has not shown a desire to take up any legislation challenging gerrymandering.
""Hopefully, the next Congress will address the issue, but I am not optimistic the president will support them.""
Lowenthal said he was encouraged that the two cases ""will be able to be re-argued at their respective federal courts, and if both go quickly can be brought back to the Supreme Court as soon as their next session.""
Lowenthal noted there is another case out of North Carolina for the high court to consider next.
""There are also many ballot initiatives being taken up in the states and the municipalities throughout the country that seek to change the ways their respective states and local governments draw political districts,"" Lowenthal said. ""Many of these voter-led initiatives are following California's framework, implementing independent redistricting commissions.""

Though taxpayers have an extra day this year to make the payment because Dec. 10 falls on a Sunday, Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector Joseph Kelly said it's not wise to procrastinate too long.
""To avoid late penalties, property owners should not wait until the last day to make payment; please pay early,"" he said.
Payments must be postmarked on or before the end of the day on Dec. 11 to avoid a 10 percent penalty.
Property owners who are unable to pay the total amount due can make a partial payment, which reduces the amount of delinquency penalties they will be charged.
Kelly said property owners can find the amount due on any parcel, and answer the majority of any other related questions, by visiting lacountypropertytax.com, or by calling the toll-free Property Tax Information Line at (888) 807-2111.
Payments can be made online here – select ""Pay Online"" under ""Payment Options""; by mail, or in person at 225. N. Hill St., downtown, in the first-floor lobby on weekdays between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. OR pay by credit or debit card over the phone by calling (888) 473-0835.

3,/california/belmontshore/long-beach-congressman-sued-displaying-pride-flag,2017-07-20T04:01:42Z,Suit Aims To Stop Legislators Flying  Pride Flags,0,0,Paige Austin,Patch Staff,"LONG BEACH, CA — Long Beach Rep. Alan Lowenthal Wednesday pledged to fight a lawsuit by a lobbyist, who wants to force him to ta his ""Pride Flag"" down from his Washington, D.C. office because it makes him feel uncomfortable.
Chris Sevier, a self-described ""former Judge Advocate General, combat Veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, DC lobbyist, overseas missionary, whistleblower and recording artist,"" filed the suit in federal court in Washington Tuesday. He specifically named Lowenthal and Reps. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) Donald Beyer, (D-Virginia) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Oregon) as defendants.
Sevier claims the flag makes him feel unwelcome in federal buildings and therefor unable to approach the defendants to perform his lobbying duties.
Lowenthal, among the first legislators to raise the Pride flag in his office, said he won't be intimidated by lawsuit.
""I fly the Pride Flag outside my office in support of every LGBTQ individual -- those in my district, those in our nation, and those around the world,"" Lowenthal said. ""It is a symbol of both how far we have come on equality for all Americans and, as these incidents illustrate, how far we still have to go. It is a symbol of love, of peace and diversity. I will fight this hateful attempt to silence equality and justice. We have come too far to allow the voices of bigotry and hate to win.""
Lowenthal has been flying the flag since in March 2013.
But the symbol of love is simply too hateful to Sevier, who has long wage war against marriage equality. In his 36-page complaint, Sevier said he was offended by the defendants display of the banner, a symbol of gay and lesbian pride, outside their offices but was not opposed to the flag being displayed inside congressional offices. The suit ""respectfully asks"" that a judge force the four lawmakers to ""remove the Gay Pride Rainbow Colored Flag on display.""
In his court papers, Sevier argues that ""homosexuality"" is a ""religion,"" so the display of the flag violates the 1st Amendment establishment clause.
Davis, one of the three defendants named in the case, also released a statement, saying it was ""disheartening that in this day and age this is still an issue.""
""Be assured that hateful lawsuits are not going to stop me from celebrating our nation's diversity. If anything, this lawsuit is a reminder of the need for us to work even harder for full equality for all Americans,"" she said. ""As the proud representative of the heart of LGBTQ San Diego, the rainbow flag in front of my D.C. office is a source of pride for me and my constituents. It is a symbol of our commitment to full equality.""
Among other things, Sevier has asked the court to declare homosexuality a religion and strike down rulings that led to the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage. He also seeks damages of $1 and to recoup legal fees. According to news reports, Sevier has also filed suit in Utah and other states demanding the right to marry his laptop computer, in light of the same- sex marriage ruling.

4,/california/belmontshore/long-beach-hosts-republican-debate-viewing-party,2016-01-28T18:32:09Z,Long Beach Hosts Republican Debate Viewing Party,0,0,Alexander Nguyen,Patch Staff,"Republican organizations will conduct viewing parties at four sites in Los Angeles County and two in Orange County for tonight's debate, which is expected to involve seven of the party's top eight presidential candidates.
The Los Angeles County watch parties will be held at:
The debate will begin at 6 p.m. on Fox News Channel. It is being held at the Iowa Events Center in Des Moines.
The debate's live stream will be made available for free without authentication on all desktop and mobile devices by FoxNews.com.
Front-runner Donald J. Trump has said he will not participate in the debate, calling a sarcastic press statement issued by Fox News on Tuesday the final straw.
The statement jokingly questioned how he would handle Russian president Vladimir V. Putin and Ayatollah Ali Khameni of Iran if he could not handle Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.
The Trump campaign has said the billionaire businessman will participate in what it is billing as a ""special event to benefit veterans organizations"" to be held at Drake University in Des Moines, coinciding with the debate.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul regained a spot in the top-tier debate after failing to qualify for the most recent one, which was held Jan. 14 and carried by Fox Business Network.
If Trump does not participate in today's debate, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will be at the center of the stage.
Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Paul will be to Cruz's left. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich will be to Cruz's right.
The arrangement of lecterns was determined by the candidates' standing in the polls.
Kelly, ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier and ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace will moderate the debate.
""There will be policy topics that have been covered before, but not asked in the way we're asking these questions and there will be some new issues that have not come up before,"" Baier said Wednesday on Fox News Channel's talk show ""The Five.""
""The real deal is to try to get them off the talking points and to phrase the questions in a way that they don't have an exit ramp to get back on their stump speech from the campaign trail.""
A debate involving second-tier candidates -- former Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore -- will precede the top-tier debate. Coverage will begin at 4 p.m. on Fox News Channel.
To qualify for the top-tier debate, candidates must place in the top six spots nationally in an average of the five most recent national polls, or place within the top five in Iowa or New Hampshire in an average of the five most recent Iowa or New Hampshire polls recognized by Fox News.
To qualify for the second-tier debate, candidates must register at least 1 percent in one of the five most recent national polls recognized by Fox News.
The polls must be conducted by major nationally and state-recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques -- live interviewers, including both landlines and cellphones, and employ either random digit-dial or registration-based sampling methodologies.

The East San Pedro Bay Ecosystem Restoration Study will evaluate options for increasing waves and water circulation in the bay and restoring wetlands while not disturbing maritime operations.
Mayor Robert Garcia and Maj. Gen. Donald E. Jackson Jr. of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are among those scheduled to take part in a 2:45 p.m. ceremony to formalize the agreement, which was announced in November.
""I can't thank the Army Corps enough for working with us to start this important and groundbreaking study,"" Garcia said in November. ""Improving the coastal experience and ecosystem in our city is a win for residents, visitors and will be a boost to the Long Beach economy.""
The Long Beach Breakwater is one of three in the area that prevents waves from rolling into the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
""The breakwater, built decades ago in part to protect the Navy fleet stationed in Long Beach, has dramatically changed our ecosystem, including water circulation and tidal flow,"" Garcia said. ""The Army Corps will determine if ecosystem restoration is possible without damaging existing properties -- including the port and most importantly coastal residences.""
The study is expected to take three years.

6,/california/belmontshore/long-beach-could-be-asked-subsidize-temporary-housing-costs-homeless-county,2016-01-08T03:21:41Z,Long Beach Could Be Asked to Subsidize...,0,0,Alexander Nguyen,Patch Staff,"Los Angeles and other cities could be asked to help subsidize temporary housing costs for homeless individuals and families, and to take other steps to reduce homelessness, under a draft plan released by the county Thursday.
Los Angeles County officials say the homeless initiative, still in its draft form, focuses on stronger coordination and a ""housing first"" approach of getting more homeless people into permanent housing.
The initiative makes 47 recommendations covering six goals, which are to prevent homelessness, subsidize housing costs, increase income, provide case management and services, create a coordinated system for homeless services and increase affordable housing.
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the draft plan in February. Prior to that, the county will be holding a community meeting about the plan on Jan. 13 and taking public input until Jan. 21.
Under the plan, cities are being asked to take on a greater role in helping the homeless, such as by subsidizing housing costs. Cities would also be called on to create policy that encourages more affordable housing to be built, and improve the way police and other public safety officers interact with the homeless.
Phil Ansell, the director of the county's homeless initiative, said that the draft strategy ""invites cities to partner with the counties.""
Leaders in the city of Los Angeles -- where more than half of the region's 44,000 estimated homeless people live -- recently said they would dedicate more city resources to helping to reduce homelessness. Mayor Eric Garcetti and the City Council announced last fall they will work to contribute city funds -- potentially about $100 million -- toward the effort.
Some of those funds could go into helping the homeless pay their rent for six to 12 months until they are able to get back on their feet.
Under the county homeless initiative, cities interested in helping with rent subsidy, under a program known as rapid re-housing, would pay $500 per month for each household receiving the assistance, while the county would match that cost.
Such assistant would be directed toward homeless families and individuals who need a stable place to live so that they have a better chance of finding a job and pay for their own housing costs.
The draft plan calls for the county to put in an additional $26 million to be put toward rapid re-housing rent subsidies, on top of $10 million already approved by the county board.
City officials recently agreed to dedicated $10 million to pay for rent subsidies.
Garcetti spokeswoman Connie Llanos said the mayor supports this rapid re- housing strategy and recently proposed to dedicate $10 million to pay for rent subsidies for the homeless.
In order to provide any additional dollars, the mayor is ""willing to put everything on the table when it comes to funding for homeless services,"" which could be done by ""creating new dollars or re-prioritizing existing funding,"" Llanos said.
The county initiative also calls on cities that distribute federal housing vouchers to direct more of the assistance to those who are chronically homeless and live in permanent supportive housing units, which are residences that come with counseling, health and other services.
Ansell also said federal housing subsidies, often referred to as Section 8 vouchers, ""are the best way to provide housing for chronically homeless individuals who need permanent supportive housing.""
The draft strategy asks cities to dedicate more of those dollars to the chronically homeless, while the county is being asked to commit 50 percent of these vouchers to this population, he said.

The funding -- which would go the West Coast Earthquake Warning System -- will exceed last year's $6.5 million amount approved for the same program, according to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank.
The proposed $8.2 million also is higher than the $5 million that was proposed by President Barack Obama for the fiscal year 2016 budget.
The House is set to vote on the funding Friday. If approved, the funding still needs the Senate and the president to sign off on it.
Japan, one of the world's most earthquake-prone country, already has an early warning system in place.
The added funding would send ""a message to the western states that it supports this life-saving system,"" Schiff said. ""But the federal government cannot do it alone and will need local stakeholders, both public and private, to get behind the effort with their own resources.
He said the increased funding would be a ""very substantial sum in these budget-constrained times,"" adding that the system ""is an investment we need to make now, not after the 'big one' hits.""
Language in the proposed budget states that a ""natural hazards program"" should get $60.5 million to address ""earthquake hazards,"" with $8.2 million of that amount used ""to transition the earthquake early warning demonstration project into an operational capability for the West Coast.""
The U.S. Geological Survey is working with Caltech, UC Berkeley, the University of Washington and the University of Oregon to create the early warning system, and is now in the testing phase.
It would cost $38.2 million to completely build out the system for the West Coast, with annual operating costs estimated at $16.1 million, officials said.

9,/california/belmontshore/parents-college-student-killed-long-beach-police-sue-city,2015-12-16T23:37:46Z,Parents of College Student Killed by Long Beach...,0,0,Alexander Nguyen,Patch Staff,"The parents of a college student shot and killed by a Long Beach police officer on May 27 sued the city Wednesday.
The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Amr Morad and Amal Alkabra, the father and mother, respectively, of Feras Morad, who are seeking unspecified damages.
A representative for the Long Beach City Attorney's Office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the lawsuit, which alleges wrongful death, negligent training and supervision, negligent infliction of emotional distress and civil rights violations.
PREVIOUSLY:
However, police previously said Morad appeared to be on drugs that night.
Family members said earlier that Morad had been studying with friends when they took hallucinogenic mushrooms to which he had a bad reaction, and after a fight ensued, he jumped through a second-story window.
At a news conference this morning at the Pasadena office of the family's attorneys, his father said: ""It was too early for him to go,"" his voice breaking.
""I do not understand for the life of me how could this happen?"" he said. ""So easy. A harmless boy wounded, bleeding, no shirt, no shoes ... 7 o'clock at that time it was bright daylight and he gets killed.""
Long Beach police Officer Matthew Hernandez -- who is named as a defendant, along with LBPD Chief Robert Luna -- confronted Morad near Cal State Long Beach, where the 20-year-old Woodland Hills native was due to begin classes in the fall, according to attorneys for the plaintiffs.
Morad was confused, bleeding from a serious cut on his arm and suffering possible head trauma after falling through a window of a second-floor apartment on East 15th Street, according to the suit, which says he was unarmed and in need of medical attention.
Hernandez, a 12-year-veteran of the force, shouted commands at Morad, who was ""clearly disoriented and injured,"" according to the complaint.
""Despite Morad's clear need of medical attention, Hernandez made the fatal and rash decision to use deadly force,"" the suit states.
Hernandez shot Morad five times at ""point-blank range, including twice in the chest,"" then turned the young man over onto his stomach and handcuffed him, according to the lawsuit.
""My son needed care,"" Amr Morad said. ""Instead, he got killed. My son Feras was a treasure, a natural leader, a friend. He was so intelligent. He was studying to be an attorney so he could help people. I only hope that there is a change so that the next young man gets the help he needs.""
Alkabra said a nightmare began for her the day her son was killed.
""My daughter and my neighbor woke me up, crying, to tell me my son was dead,"" she said. ""As a mother, I don't want anyone to ever feel the way I'm feeling. I hope some change will come out of this and we can make the world better. That's what Feras would've wanted.""
Morad attended El Camino Real Charter High School and later Moorpark College, choosing a longer commute in order to join Moorpark's accomplished debate team, according to the plaintiffs' attorneys.
A high school and junior college debate champion, he ranked nationally in both the Phi Rho Pi National Forensic Organization and the National Speech and Debate Championship Tournament, and competed in many other leagues, the attorneys said.
He was a ranking member of ROTC while at El Camino Real, according to the plaintiff's lawyers.
According to an account of the shooting provided in July by the LBPD, paramedics had been sent to the area along with the officer, on reports of a disturbance after the window was shattered.
The officer saw three people in an alley and, as he began to exit his patrol vehicle, one of the three began to walk quickly in his direction, covered with blood from a large cut, according to the LBPD.
The officer told Morad he was there to help him, but the man walked toward the officer, ignoring a command to stop so he could be treated, according to police.
""The suspect advanced more rapidly toward the officer, who perceived the suspect was now a threat and (was) going to assault him,"" according to the LBPD statement. ""During the next few minutes, the officer utilized verbal commands, an electronic control device, an impact weapon and physical force to gain compliance but was unsuccessful.
""Ultimately, the suspect again advanced toward the officer, telling the officer he was going to attack him. At that time, an officer-involved shooting occurred.""

Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City, did just that today while announcing he has introduced legislation that would name the Van Nuys post office in honor of the screen legend.
As noted in a statement from his office, the proposed legislation ""is going to be so good and so smart that it will completely make America great again. America is going to be the best.""
The sarcastic reference to Trump's presidential campaign slogan is no accident, as Cardenas clearly ramped up his sense of humor -- and Trump-like rhetoric -- for the announcement.
""All of the pieces of legislation introduced this year have been losers,"" Cardenas said. ""Anyone can negotiate a multi-year transportation funding program, but in order to do what I've done, you have to be able to make deals. That is the reason I was elected, because I know how to make deals and I've got the best people, and they also know how to make deals. That's how we got this done.""
Cardenas said he has already garnered the support of most of the state's congressional delegation for the Monroe post office bill, along with that of the Van Nuys Neighborhood Council, ""because they know it will be a super law.""
Monroe attended Van Nuys High School in the 1940s. Cardenas' office boasted that the bill to name the post office in her honor is ""the most important piece of legislation ever etched into the Congressional Record.""

""They can say what they want, but it's really child rape,"" Knabe said of perpetrators.
Interim County Counsel Mary Wickham told the board the way was clear to draft an ordinance that would provide for the publication of names and booking photos of those convicted of soliciting prostitution or loitering with intent to solicit prostitution. The emphasis of the ordinance will be on minors.
Supervisor Sheila Kuehl reminded Wickham that the county has formally agreed not to refer to the victims of child sex trafficking as prostitutes and asked that the language be carefully drafted.
Kuehl also questioned the practice of arresting people for loitering with intent, saying she thought the allegation amounted to ""mind reading.""
That raised the possibility that the final ordinance as drafted may not include those convicted of the loitering charge.
The Orange County District Attorney's Office already publishes the names of perpetrators on a website titled ""Sex Purchasers.""
Critics have questioned whether the practice is an effective deterrent. The Los Angeles Times editorial board, when Knabe first made his proposal, called the plan ""anachronistic"" and said it amounted to ""sensationalism.""
Knabe was undeterred, predicting the ordinance is ""going to have a dramatic impact.""

The Board of Supervisors agreed today to spend about $905,000 to open some homeless shelters six weeks earlier this winter and keep them open 24 hours a day during major storms.
Supervisor Hilda Solis proposed the plan, saying it was critical given the threat of a record-setting El Nino event.
""Recent storms felt throughout the county were mild in comparison to the potential devastation an El Nino event could cause this winter,"" Solis said, noting some people had to be rescued from rushing water near Cypress Park and in Pomona and South El Monte during recent heavy rainfall.
""We need to be prepared and offer our most vulnerable shelter so they won't sleep in riverbeds, where they face the possibility of being swept away by strong currents,"" she said.
The plan, which covers 600 beds to be made available from Oct. 15 to March 15, will be coordinated by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. The total represents nearly 40 percent of the roughly 1,520 winter shelter beds in the agency's program.

Supervisors Don Knabe and Michael Antonovich cast the dissenting votes. Two weeks ago, they independently proposed exempting nonprofit businesses, seasonal workers and some employees in training from the wage increase, but failed to gain sufficient support.
The ordinance gives businesses with 25 or fewer employees an additional year to reach the $15 hourly pay rate.
The board initially approved the county wage hike on July 21. A series of increases are planned over five years, beginning July 1, 2016, and reaching $15 an hour by 2020. The wage will go to $10.50 in July 2016, $12 in July 2017, $13.25 in July 2018, $14.25 in July 2019, and then to $15 the following year.
After 2022, the wage will be adjusted annually based on the cost of living.
Knabe opposed tying the minimum wage to a cost-of-living index, saying it would limit the county's flexibility in difficult financial times and hurt small businesses.

Backers of an initiative that would impose a property tax surcharge on real estate parcels with an assessed value of more than $3 million to finance projects intended to reduce poverty may begin gathering signatures, Secretary of State Alex Padilla announced this week.
The surcharge is based on a sliding scale ranging from .03 percent for real property assessed at $3 million to .08 percent for real property assessed at $10 million or more.
Tax revenue generated from the initiative would be allocated to programs including those providing prenatal services, expanded childcare, early childhood education, after-school and summer programs, job training grants, tax credits and monetary aid.
The surcharge would expire 20 years after passage.
Passage of the initiative would result in additional increased state revenues estimated to be between $6 billion and $7 billion for the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to an analysis made by the Legislative Analyst's Office and Department of Finance.
Valid signatures from 585,880 registered voters -- 8 percent of the total votes cast for governor in the 2014 general election -- must be submitted by March 21 to qualify the measure for the November 2016 ballot, according to Padilla.

Who is the little girl, who got a personal papal blessing Wednesday when she slipped through a barricade as Pope Francis was being driven by?
Sophie Cruz was a guest of Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City and her meeting was no accident.
The unscripted moment captured international attention as the plucky five-year-old made it past security to wrap her arms around the Pope and become an advocate for millions of undocumented immigrants living in limbo.
Sophie, whose parents are undocumented and whose father labors at a Los Angeles factory, was chosen as the most likely advocate to get close to the pope.
Alicia Flores, executive director of La Hermandad in Los Angeles, told MSN the group chose Sofie because the pope has previously shown a soft heart for children.
According to MSN, Sophie had already tried and failed to get through to the Pope at the White House.
So she tried again and managed to get around a metal fence as the Popemobile made its way down Constitution Avenue. She caught the pope's eye, and the pontiff -- known for interacting with people in crowds -- waved the little girl over.
A security guard at first tried to usher her away, but then carried her to the pope, who embraced her and kissed her head in front of a national television audience.
The little girl handed the pope a letter, in which she urged the pontiff to talk to President Barack Obama about immigration.
""For the immigrants, they are good people,"" she wrote in Spanish in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News. ""They know how to work in the fields, growing oranges, watermelons, onions and many vegetables. Because they deserve to come out of the darkness and be recognized for the hard work that they do, like my dad, who I almost never see.""
She also handed the pope a hand-drawn picture, depicting the pope holding hands with a line of five children. The photo is captioned ""My friends and I love each other, no matter the color of our skin."" She also gave the pope a yellow shirt.
Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City, said the shirt is worn by supporters of Hermandad Mexicana. Sophie and her father were among the members of the organization who received tickets from Cardenas' office to watch the pope's speech to Congress Thursday.
Sophie told MSN she rarely sees her father, because he works many days from 4:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. ""She hopes one day she won't live in fear that her father could be forced out of the country they call home,"" according to MSN.
Sophie's father, who has been working in the United States for 10 years, told MSN his daughter worries about losing her parents because she has seen families separated before.
""The fathers and mothers of U.S.-born children live in complete uncertainty,"" Raul Cruz said. ""I believe Pope Francis was sent by God.""

Los Angeles Times
reported.
""Quite honestly, I don't think he wants it that bad,"" retired insurance agent John O. Green of La Mesa is quoted as saying of Bush. ""It's like he's going through the motions.""
According to Green, Fiorina's command of the stage showed she could ""annihilate"" Hillary Rodham Clinton in a debate. He was torn between Fiorina and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the told the Times.
""She was just so awesome,"" he said. ""Her mind is so quick, so facile. And she has facts. Boom. Boom. Boom.""
Trump has characterized Hewlett-Packard under Fiorina as a ""disaster"" in an interview with CBS's ""Face the Nation.""
That doesn't bother Fiorina supporter Chris Elliott, a florist, who told the Times, ""I don't have any uncomfortable feelings about her getting kicked out at HP.""
""I'm tired of the Bushes, and I don't think Bush has the oomph to get us there,"" Ben Carson supporter Corky Frye of Murrieta told the Times.
Park Cockerill, a retired teacher who lives in La Cresecenta, backed Trump before the debate but changed his mind after watching Trump quarrel with multiple rivals and has switched to Rubio, he told the Times.
""I don't like the name calling,"" Cockerill said. He was thankful that Trump forced immigration to the top of the campaign agenda.
Rene Marcaux, a U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps commander who lives in Westminster, remains a Trump supporter, but she was left uneasy by his responses on foreign affairs questions, she said.
""I'd like to see a little more depth to him,"" she told the Times. ""He's entertaining, but if he's going to really go for it, he needs to step up and start producing.""
