November 9, 2020
Mayor Miro Weinberger and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) today announced that HUD has awarded more than $3.6 million to the City of Burlington to help protect low-income children and families from lead-based paint and home health hazards. The announcement took place at a home that is enrolled in the Burlington Lead Program.
With this funding, the City's Burlington Lead Program will be able to address lead hazards in 110 homes that are occupied by low- and very low-income families with children. The program also will use this funding to conduct education, outreach, workforce development, and capacity-building within Burlington and Winooski, and leverage local resources to further protect the community from lead poisoning.
""All Burlington families deserve homes that are safe, healthy, and affordable,"" said Mayor Miro Weinberger. ""Our Burlington Lead Program is a critical part of the City's work to make that vision of a reality, and this award means that that work will continue. With this funding, the lead program team will keep working to prevent childhood lead poisoning, and also expand the scope of our program to address other housing safety and health issues faced by the most vulnerable members of our community. I am grateful to HUD for this award, to Vermont's federal delegation for their support, and to CEDO and our Burlington Lead Program team for creating safer homes for Burlington families.""
""A healthy start at home translates to a successful life outside of the home,"" said David Tille, HUD New England Regional Administrator. ""We congratulate Mayor Weinberger and his team for their outstanding work to eradicate lead paint in Burlington homes. HUD is proud to be your partner in making Burlington homes safe for families and their kids.""
""Lead paint is a dangerous and invisible toxin that often hits us where we live: in our homes,"" said Senator Patrick Leahy. ""I've been glad to partner with Burlington and other communities to make lead removal a priority. With the hard work of organizations like the Burlington Lead Program, its risk to children and families can be avoided. During this pandemic, we all are spending more time at home. Vermont has one of the oldest housing stocks in the country, and this funding is more important than ever to help ensure that people living in housing built before 1978 stay safe and healthy.""
""Burlington is full of historic homes with character, but every resident deserves to know that their house is safe from poisonous chemicals like lead that have not been used for many years,"" said Congressman Peter Welch. ""This award is wonderful news for the Burlington Lead Program to continue their mission of protecting families and children from exposure to lead in their homes.""
""Lead dust is invisible and causes the most harm in children's growing bodies,"" said Margaret Williams, Coordinator of the Burlington Lead Program. ""Our program works to keep children safe from hazards that may be in their home by replacing windows, stabilizing paint, and other needed treatments. I invite members of the community to reach out to the Burlington Lead Program with any questions or concerns about home hazards, and our program currently is accepting applications.""
Funding Breakdown
The funding is made up of $3,093,992 from the Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction (LBPHR) Grant Program and $530,000 in Healthy Homes Supplemental Funding, and is part of HUD awards of $165 million across 44 state and local government agencies in 23 states, which will improve over 14,000 homes. The LBPHR program is designed to identify and clean up dangerous lead in low-income families' homes, and the Healthy Homes Supplemental Funding is designed to help communities with housing-related health and safety hazards in addition to lead-based paint hazards.

In November, we show gratitude for the many things we are thankful for throughout the year. Family usually tops the list. The strong women in our lives are one of the central figures we appreciate.
More women in the 21st century work, pay Social Security taxes, and earn credit toward monthly retirement income than at any other time in our nation's history. Yet, on average, women face greater economic challenges in retirement than men.
The majority of the people receiving Social Security benefits are women. Women generally live longer than men while often having lower lifetime earnings. And women may reach retirement with smaller pensions and other assets compared to men. These are three key reasons why Social Security is vitally important to women.
If you've worked and paid taxes into the Social Security system for at least 10 years, and have earned a minimum of 40 work credits, you may be eligible for your own benefits. Once you reach age 62, you may be eligible for your own Social Security benefit whether you're married or not and whether your spouse collects Social Security or not. If you're eligible and apply for benefits on more than one work record, you generally receive the higher benefit amount."

October 29, 2020
Today, Mayor Miro Weinberger announced a partnership between the Burlington International Airport and VGS in which the utility will provide the local match for the BTV Sound Mitigation Program, closing the gap needed to apply for $4.5 million in federal funds for soundproofing in 2021, and without any impact on the general funds of the communities around the Airport. Mayor Weinberger was joined at the announcement by South Burlington Council Chair Helen Riehle, Winooski Mayor Kristine Lott, and VGS President and CEO Neale Lunderville.
""From my first days in this office, one of my top goals for the Airport has been to put the millions of dollars that we receive from the federal government into improving homes instead of tearing them down,"" said Mayor Weinberger. ""Today we're announcing that we've nearly turned around the ocean liner, and are now on a route that should eventually make hundreds of homes in Winooski, Burlington, and South Burlington more energy efficient, comfortable, and quiet in the years to come. I'm grateful to Mayor Lott and Chair Riehle for the collaboration that brought us to this point, and to VGS for coming to the table with an innovative and impactful solution. I also want to thank Vermont's federal delegation for their work to secure vital federal funds, and the Airport team, with leadership from Nic Longo, for their tireless work to get to this outcome.""
Through the partnership, VGS will use Energy Efficiency Utility (EEU) funds to provide the 10 percent local match that is required to secure federal funding for the program. Starting in 2021, VGS is prepared to commit $550,000 in EEU funds to provide the local match for $4.5 million in federal funds. The years of 2021 and 2022 will be considered pilot years during which the program will be launched and adjusted as necessary, and VGS and the airport will work together to lay the groundwork for investment at similar levels in the years to follow. The Airport's previous FAA noise mitigation program was in place for 30 years, and it is expected that the new program also could be in place for a decade or more.
""Weatherization is a cornerstone strategy for achieving both Vermont's and VGS's bold climate goals,"" said Neale Lunderville, President and CEO of VGS. ""By pairing up weatherization and soundproofing, we help reduce our customers' carbon footprint, lower their monthly costs, and make their homes more comfortable. This innovative approach demonstrates the value of partnership and collaboration, and is the kind of thinking we need to fight climate change in the years ahead. I applaud our community leaders for their unwavering commitment to make this project a reality.""
""I welcome the collaborative approach and partnership that Burlington International Airport and Vermont Gas Systems are bringing to sound insulation efforts affecting the surrounding communities,"" said Senator Patrick Leahy. ""As Vice Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to do my part by advocating for the necessary federal funding for the FAA's Airport Improvement Program that supplies grants in support of those activities."" John Tracy, State Director for the Office of Senator Leahy, shared remarks at the announcement.
The Airport and VGS have signed a Letter of Intent, and now will be seeking further approvals. As an immediate next step, VGS will work with the Airport and the Airport's sound consultant, the Jones Payne Group, to continue planning for the rollout of the sound program. The pilot program will enable the design and construction of soundproofing for an estimated 10-12 homes in 2021, and position the Airport to apply for federal funds to design soundproofing for 50 homes in 2021, construct soundproofing for those homes in 2022, and continue serving a similar number of homes in the years to follow.
This partnership follows other recent advances in noise mitigation, most notably, a $3.49 million federal appropriation that did not require a local match for soundproofing and HVAC upgrades at Chamberlin Elementary School in South Burlington. The design of this project is currently underway, with construction anticipated to start in summer 2021.
New BTV Sound Mitigation Program Received Federal Approval on October 16, 2020
The partnership follows the recent approval of the new BTV Sound Mitigation Program earlier this month by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Previously, the Airport operated under a sound program that was in place from 1989 to 2019, which followed a model of acquiring and demolishing impacted homes as its primary noise mitigation measure.
The new program, which has been in development for several years, was formally approved on October 16, 2020, and adopts sound insulation as the primary noise mitigation measure. Under this program, the Airport will work with homeowners to determine if they qualify, and if they do, will then plan for and construct replacements of windows and doors, and in some circumstances, air conditioning and air sealing.
Partnership Follows Breakthrough Agreement between Burlington, South Burlington, and Winooski
The partnership follows two years of discussions and negotiations between the cities of Burlington, South Burlington, and Winooski, that improved strained municipal relations on Airport issues and culminated in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that Mayor Weinberger, Councilor Riehle, and Mayor Lott agreed to in the winter of 2020, and were on track toward finalizing when the process was interrupted by the pandemic. The MOU committed the municipalities to collaboration on multiple fronts including finding a source for the local match that is not the general funds of the three communities, and to work with local utilities to maximize weatherization money. Though the MOU is not yet finalized, the partnership with VGS flows directly from the work that led to this agreement.
""South Burlington has been committed to finding a way to preserve and improve housing affected by the military mission at BTV,"" said South Burlington Council Chair Helen Riehle. ""We have been very vocal at times and determined to achieve noise mitigation. This partnership is a real start and a classic example of the 'Vermont Way' — don't give up, talk through the differences, find a creative approach that works for all, collaborate with interested parties, and voila, you find a path forward! The City of South Burlington is pleased and looks forward to moving ahead.""
""The City of Winooski has prioritized preservation of quality affordable housing throughout this process,"" said Winooski Mayor Kristine Lott. ""We're very pleased to see this kind of collaboration that can bring joint benefits of both sound insulation and weatherization to many of our residents. This is a great start and I look forward to continued collaboration in the effort to fund mitigation for as many homes as we can as quickly as possible.""
That Memorandum of Understanding followed, in 2019, the Airport releasing an updated Noise Exposure Map that identified 2,640 homes in South Burlington, Williston, Winooski, Colchester, and Burlington that are within the contour lines of 65-plus decibels, and therefore may be eligible for Federal Aviation Administration funds for sound mitigation through the Airport Improvement Program.
""For over 30 years, BTV has committed to participating in the voluntary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sponsored Part 150 program that assesses and quantifies noise impacts from aircraft noise, which aids in the development of the Noise Compatibility Program (NCP) to minimize those impacts,"" said Gene Richards, Director of Aviation at Burlington International Airport. ""This partnership with VGS illustrates how the Airport has worked with diverse partners. The Airport is grateful for VGS' commitment to generating a win-win for our community.""

October 26, 2020
ANEW Place today announced the purchase of the Champlain Inn at 165 Shelburne Road, and its plans to transform the space to provide temporary housing for those in our community who are experiencing homelessness. The Inn will fill the void left by the closing of the low-barrier shelter on South Winooski Ave, and realize the goal of establishing a year-round low-barrier option in Burlington that Mayor Miro Weinberger articulated in his 2017 State of the City and has budgeted local funds for in recent budget cycles. The City actively worked to support ANEW Place's efforts through technical assistance, an emergency resolution, and funding for ongoing operations, and by fully backing and advocating for Covid-emergency funds to be used for this project.
At the Inn, there will be space for up to 50 people experiencing homelessness to access shelter in a way that is Covid-safe and available throughout the year. ANEW Place will provide Inn guests with onsite services, including case managers and assistance with finding permanent housing.
""ANEW Place is excited for the opportunity to purchase and reimagine the Champlain Inn,"" said Kevin Pounds, Director of ANEW Place ""Thank you to the Vermont Housing & Conservation Board for believing in this project and providing the federal funds to make it possible. All of us have been impacted in some way by the COVID crisis, and this is especially true for the increasing number of our neighbors experiencing homelessness. Our hope and prayer is the Champlain Inn will be a place where people, regardless of their situation and story, experience a new start. ANEW Place is blessed with an incredible team of people who've moved this project forward: Cindy Reid with Cathedral Square, Mark Sammut with Wright & Morrissey Inc., Bob Duncan with Duncan Wisniewski Architecture, Grace Ciffo with CEDO, and Hobart Popick with Langrock, Sperry, & Wool. I especially want to thank ANEW's frontline staff who've worked tirelessly to provide a supportive shelter environment in a basement, RVs, and tents while navigating the challenges of COVID. We're only as good as the team around us.""
""Low-barrier shelters save lives and are a critical resource for protecting some of our most vulnerable residents. The opening of a year-round facility represents a major expansion of our community's capacity to address the challenge of homelessness,"" said Mayor Miro Weinberger. ""I am so grateful to the many partners who came together to realize this goal that we have labored for years to achieve. I am thankful to ANEW Place and their committed team led by Kevin Pounds, Cathedral Square, and the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board for finding a way to leverage the great need presented by this global pandemic and turn it into long-term opportunity, and to the neighbors and South End City Councilors who supported this initiative. Having a year-round low-barrier solution is just one of the ways that our community is going to emerge from this pandemic even stronger.""
ANEW Place closed on the purchase of the Champlain Inn on Friday, October 23, and funded the purchase with $2.5 million in Coronavirus Relief Funds granted by the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board (VHCB). ANEW Place will use the 33-unit motel to offer free rooms year-round for projected occupancy of 50 people. The property also includes a 2,800 square foot house that will provide space for on-site services, group meetings, and laundry facilities.
Now, ANEW Place will make several needed repairs to the property, and plans to re-open to serve clients on December 1.
Meeting the Needs of People Experiencing Homelessness During Covid-19 Pandemic
Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, ANEW Place was operating the Burlington Low-Barrier Shelter at a location at 179 South Winooski Avenue. However, when the pandemic hit, it became clear that the facility was not safe for staff and guests. It did not allow for physical distance, had poor ventilation, and did not have space where symptomatic individuals could isolate.
As a result, ANEW Place, the City of Burlington, and the State of Vermont worked quickly to find an alternative. ANEW Place shut down the site on March 26, and as a temporary solution, moved the remaining guests into 26 RVs at the City's campground at North Beach. In June, this transitioned into a sanctioned tenting area with ANEW Place staff continuing to provide support.
The demand for a low-barrier shelter typically decreases during the warm weather months, but this year, by August, up to 40 people were staying at the campground, approximately two-thirds of whom were not staying at the Low-Barrier Shelter during the winter months before Covid-19. This is true even as more than 400 people experiencing homelessness are using State vouchers to stay in Chittenden County hotels.
With the need for a low-barrier facility clear, and the winter months approaching, the City of Burlington and ANEW Place began pursuing a plan to create a tiny home community for people experiencing homelessness on City-owned land on Sears Lane. However, funding for that plan proved difficult to secure. ""It was August, our backs were against the wall, and we were praying for a miracle,"" says Kevin Pounds, Director of ANEW Place. Kevin met with Champlain Housing Trust COO Michael Monte to identify possible facilities, and only the Champlain Inn met the needs of a low-barrier facility. Though the Inn was not for sale, Kevin reached out to the owner and initiated a discussion about purchase.
Hurdles remained. On October 5, the Burlington City Council approved an emergency resolution to amend the zoning of the inn so that people experiencing homelessness would have a Covid-safe option before the freezing temperatures of winter. The resolution aligns the occupancy permitted for a residential use with the occupancy that the Inn was permitted as a commercial use. Then, on October 13, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board approved ANEW Place's application for Coronavirus Relief Funds to purchase the Inn.
At the Champlain Inn, each room will provide guests with a private or semi-private sleeping area, electrical outlets to recharge phones and for other needs, and direct access to ANEW Place's programs and services. The facility provides space for physical distancing, has appropriate ventilation, and allows for the isolation of symptomatic guests – making it a space that meets the needs of the Covid era and where people experiencing homelessness will be able to access shelter with dignity and respect.
""The Board believes the successful application for a grant of $2.5 million to acquire and rehabilitate the Champlain Inn reflects both the tenacity and heart of ANEW and the City of Burlington,"" said Gus Seelig, Director for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board. ""In this time of responding to a pandemic, it has never been more clear that Housing is Health Care. The Champlain Inn will keep people warmer and healthier in the months ahead. We thank CHT for identifying this opportunity and deeply appreciate the hard work of Cindy Reid and the Cathedral Square Corporation in developing the application and planning for improvements. Finally, much thanks go to Senators Jane Kitchel, Tim Ashe, and Michael Sirotkin, Speaker Mitzi Johnson, and Chair Tom Stevens for insisting the a portion of the Coronavirus Relief Fund be used to expand Vermont's supply of affordable homes.""
""This project is one of several collaborations between Cathedral Square and ANEW Place,"" said Cindy Reid, Director of Development for Cathedral Square. ""The pandemic has certainly highlighted systemic inequities in our housing system. We share ANEW's compassion for treating people in need with dignity, and for identifying and mobilizing resources to provide safe homes and services to help those in need.""
History of Effort to Create Low-Barrier Facility in Burlington
Until several years ago, there was no low-barrier facility in Burlington, meaning a facility that welcomes any adult regardless of their sobriety or mental health. That changed in 2014, when Mayor Miro Weinberger ended the City's long-standing opposition to a low-barrier shelter, and several organizations worked with the City's support to establish a low-barrier shelter for the winter months. In the years that followed, the facility took several forms:

If you rely on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments or Social Security Disability (SSDI) benefits and want to start working or return to work, we can help. A Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is a rule under SSI to help people with disabilities return to work. If you receive SSI or could qualify for SSI after setting aside income or resources so you can pursue—or achieve—a work goal, you could benefit from a PASS.
How does a PASS help someone return to work?
We base SSI eligibility and payment amounts on income and resources (things of value that the individual owns).
PASS lets a disabled individual set aside money and things he or she owns to pay for items or services needed to achieve a specific work goal.
The objective of the PASS is to help disabled individuals find employment that reduces or eliminates SSI or SSDI benefits.
You can read all about the PASS program at www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-11017.pdf.
The plan must be in writing, and Social Security must approve it beforehand. To start, contact your local Social Security office for an application (Form SSA-545-BK) or you can access the form at www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-545.html."

October 6, 2020
Proposed zoning ordinance would use science-based carbon pricing to accelerate electrification of thermal systems for all new construction
At Monday's City Council meeting, the City presented a proposal for building electrification, the latest step in progress toward making Burlington a Net Zero Energy city. The proposal, called the ""Building Electrification and Carbon Price Ordinance,"" would create two pathways to incentivize new development to use efficient and electric power for heating needs and to dramatically reduce the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure in Burlington in the years to come. The proposal was heard by the Council and will next go to the Council's Ordinance Committee as part of the process toward adoption.
""Even as Burlington has sought to respond to a global pandemic and national uprising for racial justice, we've also kept focus on our other central emergency – the climate crisis,"" said Mayor Weinberger. ""It is increasingly clear that strategic electrification of buildings and vehicles is a critical way to both help save the planet and sustain our standard of living. Burlington is aggressively leading the country toward this essential and promising vision, and our building electrification proposal represents the City's next big step forward.""
Building Electrification and Carbon Price Ordinance
Efficient and electric buildings are one of the most important areas in which to reduce fossil fuel emissions in Burlington, according to the ""Net Zero Energy Roadmap"" for local-level climate progress that the City released in September 2019. Making buildings efficient and electric means incorporating comprehensive weatherization and using renewable electricity for space and hot water heating by installing technologies like cold climate heat pumps and heat pump water heaters.
Accordingly, the ""Building Electrification and Carbon Price Ordinance"" proposal that the City presented on Monday night creates two pathways. In pathway one, a new building does not connect to fossil fuel infrastructure and, therefore, no further requirements apply during the permit process. In pathway two, the new building connects to fossil fuel infrastructure and, therefore, the owner would pay a ""building carbon fee"" of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent to the expected emissions for the first 10 years of building operation. This process would repeat every 10 years until the building no longer is using fossil fuels. The building also would be required to be constructed as ""electric ready,"" so it can add electrification technologies in the future. Further detail about the proposal is available online.
Work to decarbonize the heating of new buildings started in October 2019, and was endorsed by a City Council resolution in May 2020 that directed several City departments to develop a policy proposal that would include consideration of a ban on new buildings connecting to fossil fuel infrastructure for thermal needs. Since May, Burlington Electric Department (BED), Office of City Planning, and Department of Permitting and Inspections have been collaborating to develop this proposal, including holding a well-attended public meeting, consulting with building developers, and seeking technical assistance from the Building Electrification Initiative that included a review of building energy policies in other communities. Next, the City team will work to develop draft ordinance language and the Council's Ordinance Committee will consider the proposal.
Progress Toward Net Zero Energy Goal
The building electrification proposal follows other recent progress. In July, BED presented a new analysis that contains encouraging numbers on Burlington's progress. Takeaways from the analysis include:
While there is much more focused and hard work ahead, this early progress demonstrates the possibility of continuing to respond meaningfully to the global climate crisis at the local level.
""This policy proposal to reduce fossil fuel use and increase the use of technologies such as cold-climate heat pumps in new buildings would accelerate our progress toward Net Zero Energy and continue Burlington's long record of climate leadership,"" said Darren Springer, General Manager of BED. ""Burlington Electric's analysis shows that moving in the direction of Net Zero Energy is not only going to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also can reduce rate pressure for our customers, providing a true win-win for our community.""
Even as the City is focused on charting a path through the climate crisis at the local level, BED also has prioritized affordability and now is heading into its twelfth year of holding electric rates steady. Further, BED recently submitted an analysis [PDF] to the Vermont Public Utility Commission that shows that, even as electrification continues, with strong management of peak demand, additional sales revenues can outpace BED's investment in new infrastructure – or in other words, that electrification can reduce rate pressure and be a net positive for BED customers.
About Burlington's Goal to Be a Net Zero Energy City
Decarbonizing Burlington will take all of us. To become a Net Zero Energy city by 2030, the Burlington of the future will be one where all our buildings are energy efficient and use new electric heating technologies, such a cold climate heat pumps, where our land use and transportation policies help support less energy use, where nearly all vehicles are powered by 100 percent renewable electricity, and where we replace 15 percent of the miles we drive each year with forms of alternative transportation.
The City asks all Burlingtonians to consider efficiency and electrification every time you make a decision about your homes, businesses, and transportation. In return, the City is working to make those choices as easy and affordable as possible.

We're often asked, ""What's the best age to start receiving retirement benefits?"" The answer is: there's not a single ""best age"" for everyone. The most important thing is to make an informed decision. Base your decision about when to apply for benefits on your individual and family circumstances.
Would it be better for you to start getting benefits early with a smaller monthly amount for more years, or wait for a larger monthly payment over a shorter timeframe? The answer is personal and depends on several factors, such as your current cash needs, your current health, and your family longevity. You should also consider plans to work in retirement and other sources of retirement income. Most importantly, study your future financial needs and obligations, and calculate your future Social Security benefit.
We encourage you to weigh all the facts carefully before making the crucial decision about when to begin receiving Social Security benefits. This decision affects the monthly benefit you will receive for the rest of your life, and may affect benefit protection for your survivors.

September 25, 2020
Today, Mayor Miro Weinberger announced that he is appointing Kyle Dodson, the President and CEO of the Greater Burlington YMCA, to a new, temporary position titled Director of Police Transformation to help lead the City's work to forge a new consensus on policing in Burlington. This work will include oversight of the Burlington Police Department's planning, policy, and engagement efforts during a period in which the City is advancing a wide range of transformation efforts. Kyle will take a temporary leave of absence from his position at the YMCA to accept the position, which is anticipated to have a term of six months.
Mayor Weinberger also announced today a series of additional actions intended to help ensure that policing incidents like the ones that have caused community pain over the last two years become even more rare, and that when they do happen there is greater transparency and accountability around them.
""The events of this summer across our nation, from Minneapolis to Kenosha to Louisville to Burlington, have made unmistakably clear that as a country and a community we are at a moment of crisis in policing that has been building for a very long time,"" said Mayor Weinberger. ""In this critical moment, we have an opportunity and a necessity to finally root out systemic racism from all our institutions, including policing, and at long last to fully deliver to our Black and brown residents the fairness, safety, and solidarity that they are due. This is hard work that no American community has fully figured out. To get this right, I am expanding the City's capacity and adding the perspective of a widely-respected, Black community leader from outside of law enforcement. We must move forward from the policing challenges of the past two years to build a new community consensus around policing. I am grateful and our community is fortunate that Kyle has agreed to lend us his considerable experience, skill, and vision to lead this work and help us make good on the promise of this moment.""
""In Vermont, we like to think about ourselves as a place apart,"" said Kyle Dodson. ""And there is something special about our physical environment and the character that it fosters. But we are also fully rooted in the American context. And America has a brutal history of institutionalized racism that continues today. It is pervasive. And therefore it is irresponsible, and it totally undermines any integrity we might want to claim, when we turn away from this reality. This move on the part of our Mayor is a definitive step in the direction of acknowledging the pain of BIPOC communities, and beginning the healing. I feel honored and humbled to be called upon to assist in this work.""
""There are a lot of people pulling for change right now—the Mayor, the City Council, the Police Commission, protestors and advocates, myself and the men and women at the BPD,"" said Chief of Police Jon Murad. ""We're still coalescing around what that change should be. How can we transform public safety while continuing to keep people safe? Because that's the bottom line—keeping people safe. I'm eager for Director Dodson to help get all these stakeholders to pull in that same direction and pull together, and I'm excited about the transformation we can achieve.""
New Role of Director of Police Transformation
As Director of Police Transformation, Kyle will bring deep leadership experience, strong community relationships, and his perspective as a BIPOC leader in Burlington to this work. He will report directly to the Mayor, and his role will focus on identifying areas for change, guiding the development of new policy, and including a broad range of community members and organizations in this work. A key part of his role will be managing, day-to-day, the multiple police transformation processes that the City already has committed to, which include:
Even as the City undertakes this work to examine policing, it also is committed to identifying and addressing the root causes of systemic racism city-wide in multiple ways. These include the City's new Director of Racial Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (REIB), Tyeastia Green, beginning a strategic planning process for REIB, and the City hiring a public health equity manager to coordinate work on the social determinants of health that make racism a public health emergency.
Kyle Dodson Brings Vision, Leadership, and New Capacity to City's Work to Transform Public Safety
Kyle Dodson has served as President and CEO of the Greater Burlington YMCA since 2016. During that time, he has led the YMCA through pivotal changes, including constructing and relocating to its new location in the heart of Burlington, successfully completing the capital campaign for the new facility, and deepening its community service mission through changes like lower membership rates and expanded early childhood education. Kyle has served on the Board of the Burlington School District, as director of Champlain College's Center for Service and Civic Engagement, and as a school principal in Massachusetts. He has lived in Burlington since 2008.
""Y communities all across the country are increasingly being called to provide service and leadership in new and unprecedented ways during these troubling times,"" said Lisa Ventriss, President of Vermont Business Roundtable and Chair of the Board of the Greater Burlington YMCA. ""The Greater Burlington YMCA family is proud that we are able to support the City of Burlington during its time of need. This will, indeed, be a sacrifice for the organization, but we are Y Strong and are confident that this is the right move by the City, and that Kyle Dodson is the right leader at the right time.""
Kyle will receive a salary of $75,000 for a six-month engagement, which is equivalent to his salary as President and CEO of the YMCA and will be funded from the Police Department and Mayor's Office budgets.
Five Additional New Actions to Advance Transformation of Policing in Burlington
To complement all of this work, Mayor Weinberger today also announced five additional substantive actions. These actions respond directly to concerns raised by the Burlington residents protesting in Battery Park and other members of the Burlington community.
These additional actions are: issuing an executive order on disciplinary decisions; directing the City Attorney to review the City's contract with the Burlington Police Officers Association and to make recommendations for areas of future change; requesting that the Police Commission approve a new body camera footage release policy by the end of October; creating a Community Service Liaison pilot program; and developing a new policy on the release of investigations into officer conduct. These actions are described in more detail in Attachment A.
Mayor Calls for Community to Include Police Officers as Partners in This Work
Also today, Mayor Weinberger called on the community to view the Police Department itself as a partner in this work to redefine public safety. ""Long-term change in policing culture or practice is possible only with buy-in and support from Burlington police officers,"" said Mayor Weinberger. ""Further, when we talk about policing in Burlington, we are talking about dozens of officers who devote themselves to the very hard job of responding to violent situations, solving crimes, and keeping our community safe, even as their profession and the definition of safety are rapidly changing. We must find a way to support, value, and engage our sworn officers, and include them in the new consensus we are forging on what public safety means – and the work itself will be better and more enduring as a result.""
These announcements follow the approval earlier this week by the City Council of a separation agreement with Burlington Police Department Sergeant Jason Bellavance. Mayor Weinberger's full statement about the agreement and the three officers whose actions have been at the center of recent protests in Battery Park, is available on the City website. The agreement seeks to bring some measure of resolution and finality to the controversies surrounding the actions of these three officers.
Today's announcements are aimed at the future and designed both to accelerate the transformation processes already underway and advance additional changes that the community has called for around police governance, discipline, body camera footage policies, and accountability.

Did you know you can see your work history online all the way back to your first job? Your earnings history is a record of your progress toward your Social Security benefits. We keep track of your earnings so we can pay you the benefits you've earned over your lifetime. This is why reviewing your Social Security earnings record is so important.
If an employer didn't properly report just one year of your earnings to us, your future benefit payments could be less than they should be. Over the course of a lifetime, that could cost you tens of thousands of dollars in retirement or other benefits to which you are entitled. It's important to identify reporting problems as soon as possible. As time passes, you may no longer have easy access to past tax documents, and some employers may no longer exist or be able to provide past payroll information.
While it's your employer's responsibility to provide accurate earnings information to us, you should still review and inform us of any errors or omissions so you get credit for the contributions you've made through payroll taxes. You're the only person who can look at your lifetime earnings record and verify that it's complete and correct.
The easiest way to verify your earnings record is to visit www.ssa.gov/myaccount and set up or sign in to your personal my Social Security account. You should review each year of listed earnings carefully and confirm them using your own records, such as W-2s and tax returns. Keep in mind that earnings from this year and last year may not be listed yet."

16,/vermont/burlington-vt/city-files-suit-against-developer-cityplace-burlington,2020-09-10T16:11:10Z,City Files Suit Against Developer Of CityPlace...,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"From the City of Burlington:
September 10, 2020
On Tuesday, September 8, the City of Burlington filed suit in Vermont Superior Court against BTC Mall Associates, LLC, the developer of the CityPlace Burlington project. The City also filed a motion for preliminary injunction to promptly compel BTC to build the public improvements as required in the written Development Agreement with the City. The City's complaint and motion are below.
Developer Initiated Legal Action
Prior to this filing, on Friday, September 4, the developer, through two letters from Don Sinex, informed the City that it was attempting to terminate the Development Agreement with the City, and that it was attempting to relinquish its existing zoning permit. These two letters are included below. Also prior to the City's filing, BTC filed suit against the City seeking court approval of its unilateral termination of the Development Agreement. BTC's letters and its lawsuit demonstrate that the developer is attempting to avoid its contractual commitments to the City.
The Development Agreement does not allow one party to unilaterally terminate the agreement once construction starts. Remarkably, the developer is attempting to shirk its responsibilities by arguing that construction never started, despite the clear facts on the ground and the Development Agreement's terms that construction starts with structural demolition of the former mall building.
In Accordance with Specifically Negotiated Terms, City Seeks Prompt Injunctive Relief from Court
The Development Agreement specifically gives the City the right to seek injunctive relief to compel compliance with its terms and requirements. The City's lawsuit seeks just that: to hold the developer accountable to the people of Burlington. It alleges breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and it seeks a declaratory judgment from the court that the Development Agreement is enforceable against BTC. Through the motion for a preliminary injunction and specific performance, the City is requesting the court to order the developer to immediately rebuild St. Paul Street and Pine Street, activate Bank Street and Cherry Street, and construct additional improvements to the public streets as promised.
City Remains Open to Settlement Negotiations Based on Terms of Existing Development Agreement
The City's goal continues to be to transform this long-troubled part of downtown Burlington into a vibrant, mixed use neighborhood. The City is seeking to hold the developer accountable to its commitment to that vision. While the City remains open to mediation with the developer to advance that outcome, that discussion must be based on the existing Development Agreement.
""The City has complied with all of its obligations under the Development Agreement,"" said attorney Marc Heath of the firm Downs Rachlin Martin PLLC, who represents the City in this litigation along with a team of litigators at the firm. ""BTC's unilateral attempt to walk away from its contractual obligations to the City is meritless. We intend to compel BTC to comply with its contractual obligations; specifically to provide the public improvements as required in the Development Agreement.""
""The developer's recent letters make explicitly clear that it is attempting to renege on its longstanding, binding commitments to the people of Burlington by arguing that it never started construction,"" said Mayor Miro Weinberger. ""Anyone who has looked at the construction site in the last two years knows that's absurd, and we're not going to let them get away with it. With this lawsuit, we are fighting for the reconnected and dramatically improved public streets and infrastructure that Burlington has been promised, and ultimately, for the widely shared vision of restored homes, jobs, and vitality in this long-troubled part of our downtown.""

Mayor Weinberger released the following statement regarding the protest at Battery Park:
""As Mayor, the safety of Burlingtonians is my top responsibility.
""I am concerned about the safety of the protestors who have demonstrated in Battery Park for the last week since the shooting of Jacob Blake. I applaud the work of the Burlington Police Officers who investigated Jordan Atwood for repeatedly approaching the demonstrators in Battery Park while brandishing an assault-style rifle, and arrested him for violating conditions of a prior criminal release.
""I am also concerned for the safety of the police and the general public after a rock was thrown at one of our officers last night, and the passage of emergency vehicles was temporarily blocked. I strongly urge all demonstrators to avoid a repeat of these public safety violations.
""Further, if the demonstrators wish to continue protest in the street, I urge them to coordinate such actions with the City so that their safety, and the safety of the public, can be assured.
""I respect and support the first amendment rights of the protestors, have met twice with a group of organizers, and share their sense that we must dismantle systemic racism in this country and this community, and in policing. The City is working hard on many fronts to achieve that goal, and I intend to keep talking with these organizers to find areas of consensus and potential progress.""
