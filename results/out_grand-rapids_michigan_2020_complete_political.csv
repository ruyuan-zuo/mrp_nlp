Justin Amash, a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump who quit the GOP and became an independent, announced Saturday he would not seek the Libertarian nomination for the White House, weeks after saying he was running because voters wanted an ""alternative"" to the two major parties.
In deciding to drop out, he cited the challenges of trying to campaign as a third-party candidate during the coronavirus pandemic.
""After much reflection, I've concluded that circumstances don't lend themselves to my success as a candidate for president this year, and therefore I will not be a candidate,"" he said in one in a series of tweets explaining his decision. He said ""the new reality of social distancing levels the playing field among the candidates in many respects, but it also means lesser known candidates are more dependent on adequate media opportunities to reach people.""
Amash said he still thinks such a candidacy could prove successful in the future.
""I continue to believe that a candidate from outside the old parties, offering a vision of government grounded in liberty and equality, can break through in the right environment,"" he tweeted. ""But this environment presents extraordinary challenges.""
Amash would have faced nearly impossible odds of winning the presidency. But third-party campaigns can have unpredictable consequences for the Democratic and Republican candidates in the race.
In 2000, Ralph Nader's Green Party presidential bid cost Democrat Al Gore crucial support and was a contributing factor in Republican George W. Bush's narrow victory. Democrat Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss to Trump has been blamed in part on the support that Green Party candidate Jill Stein picked up in states such as Pennsylvania.
Amash left the Republican Party last year and later supported Trump's impeachment in the Democratic-led House.
In announcing his intention in late April to seek the Libertarian nomination, Amash said he wanted to represent the millions of Americans who do not feel well represented by either major party."

September 18 2019
City Announces New Economic Development And Engineering Appointments
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. – City Manager Mark Washington today announced two appointments: Jono Klooster as acting director of economic development services and Tim Burkman as city engineer.
Klooster will lead the City's efforts around improving Grand Rapids' business environment, which include economic development programs and initiatives that create employment opportunities, encourage sustainable business development and result in business recruitment, retention and expansion. Burkman will lead the City's engineering operations, which include construction projects involving public roads and City-owned utilities and facilities.
Klooster is a familiar face in the City's Economic Development Department. He has been an integral part of the team for more than eight years, most recently as a senior economic development coordinator who has helped to deliver such projects as Studio Park, The Rowe apartments, Michigan State University Grand Rapids Research Center and the newly constructed Warner Building and Hyatt Place hotel.
Klooster has served as the department's second in command under Managing Director Kara Wood, who is leaving later this month for an opportunity in higher education. Klooster begins his new role Sept. 25.
""I am confident Mr. Klooster will continue to lead us forward and advance our strategic priorities around economic prosperity and affordability,"" Washington said. ""He is a rock star within our organization and he is a trusted policy expert who is well-respected in both the business community and the community at large.""
Most recently, Klooster has managed the City's Brownfield Redevelopment program, completing more than 50 projects that have resulted in more than $1 billion in investment. He also has managed the City's real estate acquisition and disposition, resulting in more than 15 acres of riverfront property to support the river restoration project and tax-foreclosed properties for affordable housing. He has assisted new and existing businesses in locating and expanding in Grand Rapids, completing more than 50 business development projects that have resulted in more than $400 million in investment.
""I am committed to ensuring Grand Rapids continues to have a prosperous, vibrant and equitable economy,"" Klooster said. ""I look forward to leading our talented team of economic development professionals to make sure this happens.""
Klooster began his career as a carpenter framing custom homes in Seattle, overseeing small crews of carpenters and laborers. He then spent a year teaching at a bilingual school in Central America before returning to Grand Rapids to use his carpentry skills in the renovation and historic restoration field. He spent three years with a small locally owned contractor, focusing on interior and exterior restoration and remodeling work in Grand Rapids' historic districts, before joining the City. He has a bachelor's degree in business from Calvin College and a master's degree in public administration from Grand Valley State University.
Washington said he was grateful for Woods' 12 years of service to the City, adding she would be missed.
""Ms. Wood has been an instrumental part of a decade of economic development in our city,"" he said. ""I am thankful to her for creating and overseeing many economic development programs and initiatives that have resulted in business recruitment, retention and expansion. I wish her the very best in her future endeavors.""
Burkman, a 17-year professional engineer, will join the City on Oct. 21. He most recently has served as executive director of Macatawa Area Coordinating Council (MACC), the metropolitan planning organization for the Holland-Zeeland area. While serving at the MACC, Burkman was responsible for developing the region's four-year transportation improvement program. This consisted of more than $117 million in federal, state and local investment in roadway, pathway and transit-related projects. He also worked to improve water quality in local lakes and streams through the promotion and implementation of best management practices.
Burkman has spent most of his career working in the City of Valparaiso (Ind.) Engineering Department – first as assistant city engineer for four years and then as city engineer for 11 years – where he earned a reputation for innovative solutions that engaged the community. During his tenure, he helped set the framework for the successful U.S. 30 corridor improvement project. This project reimagined the city's main thoroughfare, making it more walkable and more memorable. Roundabouts were introduced in Valparaiso under his leadership to improve safety at several dangerous intersections. He also led the development of a stormwater management plan and investments based on the plan that reduced neighborhood flooding across the community.
Prior to joining the City of Valparaiso, Burkman served as an engineering consultant for several other cities. The northwest Indiana native received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Valparaiso University.
""Grand Rapids is a phenomenal city, and I am thrilled to join the team here to continue the great progress already in the works and beyond.""
Burkman said.Burkman and his family moved to West Michigan last year to be part of the community they love. He said he has enjoyed developing partnerships with many local, regional and statewide leaders.
Washington touted Burkman's experience and ability to build relationships in the community.
""Mr. Burkman is a proven leader who brings experience and a record of innovation to the table,"" Washington said. ""I look forward to working with him to advance our strategic priorities around mobility, health and environment and safe community.""

The earlier you start saving, the more you can accrue in a 401k individual retirement account and other types of IRAs. Social Security helps secure your future, but Social Security is only one part of a more complete retirement plan.

Financial literacy includes having access to not just the correct general information, but also to your personal financial information. You can open your own personal my Social Security account at www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount/ and quickly have access to your information from anywhere. There, you can do many things, but the most important thing is to view your Social Security Statement.

Your Social Security Statement is an easy-to-read personal record of the earnings on which you have paid Social Security taxes and a summary of the estimated benefits you and your family could receive, including potential retirement, disability, and survivors benefits. Once you have an account, you can view your Statement at any time. You'll want to verify that your recorded earnings are correct, because your future benefits are based on your recorded earnings.

We also offer the online Retirement Estimator at www.socialsecurity.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html that provides immediate and personalized benefit estimates based on your earnings record.

7,/michigan/grand-rapids/twins-opposite-parties-run-county-board-michigan,2018-07-19T20:36:36Z,Twins Of Opposite Parties Campaign For Same Board,0,0,Beth Dalbey,Patch Staff,"KENTWOOD, MI — Twins Jessica Ann Tyson and Monica Sparks are identical in many respects, but not in their political leanings. But in a country where recent elections have strained some family relationships, the western Michigan siblings running under opposite party banners for positions on the same county governing board say that won't happen to them.
Both are running for seats on the Kent County Board of Commissioners. Tyson, a Republican, filed first for District 13. Democrat Sparks followed her sister, filing for District 12. Tyson is sure to advance to the November midterm elections as the only Republican on the ballot in her district in the Aug. 7 primary, but Sparks has a tougher climb in a four-way race.
The twins are determined not to be divided by their separate campaigns and opposing party ideology. They do agree on some issues, such as equality, justice and liberty for all. Both also say issues like mental health funding and services for senior citizens, veterans and children should be priorities.
""The left wing and the right wing belong to the same bird,"" the women said in unison to television station WXMI.
The twins became interested in politics as children. As kids, they didn't know what party their parents belonged to, but understood as youngsters that voting and civic engagement were not only a right, but a responsibility. Their parents drilled into them that people have died to protect their freedoms.
""My thing is, at the end of the day our parents taught us that we need to stand and stand for something and because we stand and we stand strong, we don't necessarily have to agree on politics or even what we're gonna drink for the evening,"" Sparks said. ""We don't have to agree on that, but one thing we have to do is coexist.""
Their early childhood experience fueled their desire to serve and make life better for Michigan families. Their biological mother was addicted to heroin, and they were abused by foster parents to the point of starvation before they were adopted by a loving family.
""It's so amazing just to be able to sit here and run for county commissioner, are you kidding me?"" Sparks said.
But campaigning separately does bring back some of that pain. The twins were separated from when they were removed from their biological mother's home and ""that was really, really hard,"" Tyson said.
It's not the same thing to be on opposite sides politically, ""but you know, that memory just took me back for just a second,"" she told the television station.
""We are not divided,"" Sparks said. ""Separated for a season, guess you could say because after this we will figure out whichever way it goes.""

In exchange for pleading guilty to three charges, Nassar, 53, will escape prosecution on more serious charges of sexually exploiting children at his home, his swimming pool and during ""interstate/international travel,"" according to the agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan. The plea agreement drew a sharp reaction from an attorney representing Team USA gymnasts who said they were molested by Nassar at national and international competitions and at the training ranch run by former national team coaches Bela and Marta Karolyi, ESPN reported.
Nassar was a physician for Team USA Gymnastics through four Olympics Games. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts and newsletters from Grand Rapids Patch,or click here to find your local Michigan Patch. Also,if you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
Nassar's agreement with the Justice Department was signed June 23 and is expected to be filed Tuesday in federal court in Grand Rapids. In it, Nassar pleaded guilty to three charge, including receipt and possession of child pornography and destruction and concealment of records, The Detroit News reported.
Federal agents arrested Nassar on pornography charges last December. According to the testimony of an FBI agent, authorities found 37,000 images or videos of child pornograpy on Nassar's property, including some videos the agent said showed Nassar sexually assaulting young girls in his swimming pool.
Separately, Nassar faces three criminal trials in the assault of nine women or girls in the Lansing area, and civil lawsuits by more than 100 women or girls alleging he sexually abused them.
Among those whose cases won't be prosecuted under the federal plea agreement are two children who said Nassar abused them during international travel between 2006 and 2012, according to the court document obtained last week by The Detroit News.
After news of the settlement broke, Irvine, California, attorney John Manly called the government's agreement not to prosecute Nassar on the most serious cases ""cowardly,"" and said young athletes who gave up their childhoods to compete for their country ""deserve better than this,"" ESPN reported.
""They've told our clients that they are not prosecuting their cases,"" said Manly, one of the lawyers representing more than 90 women or girls who have accused Nassar, including former Olympians and national team members.
""Many of our clients have spoken to and given evidence to the FBI. They gave that evidence and went through the trauma of reliving their experiences with the expectation that they would get justice,"" Manly said. ""Dr. Nassar molested young women at the Olympics. He molested young women at national competitions. And our country is not going to charge him? The message that sends these women is: 'You don't matter.' ""
Nassar exited the international stage without notice just before the 2016 Rio Olympics, and before the Indianapolis Star's explosive report on USA Gymnastics' handling of sexual abuse allegations against Nassar and others associated with the team. The story broke on the eve of the Rio Olympics.
Nassar, who has been denied bond, could spend up to 40 years in prison on the federal charges he is admitting to in the plea agreement.

10,/michigan/grand-rapids/hungry-michigan-goats-devour-union-jobs-grievance,2017-07-06T19:30:26Z,Hungry Michigan Goats Get Union's Goat,0,0,Beth Dalbey,Patch Staff,"KALAMAZOO, MI — A herd of 20 goats grazing the Western Michigan University campus in Kalamazoo are at the center of a complaint filed against the school by the nation's largest public employee bargaining unit. The 400-member Local 1668 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees filed a grievance against the university, arguing the goats are essentially ""scab"" labor and are devouring union jobs along with vegetation on a 16-acre lot the animals have been assigned to clear.
The university says the goats are doing a job that hasn't been assigned to a union crew, clearing away the overgrown brush, shrubbery, trees and weeds from the lot — and with more efficiency than human-operated heavy machinery.
The goats, supplied by an outfit known as Munchers on Hooves, were brought in specifically to clear the lot because they have insatiable appetites. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts and newsletters from Grand Rapids Patch,or click here to find your local Michigan Patch. Also,if you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
No one complained about the grazing goats, Muncher on Hooves owner Garrett Fickle told WOOD-TV. The university used goats in a pilot project last year, liked the results and brought the herbivores back for another year.
""When you use a Bobcat to try to clear things, it just compacts the ground, tears up your seeds,"" Fickle said. ""It takes your seeds that are dormant and brings them to the surface, then allows them to grow. Well, when a goat goes to the bathroom, the seed doesn't grow.""
Fickle and his wife, Gina, have been raising Boer goats for seven years and began using them to clear buckthorn from their property near Coldwater, Michigan, in 2015.
""Our goats all have their own personalities and work together as a team in hard-to-reach places. Every site that they go to is seen by them as a new salad bar,"" Gina Fickle said in a Western Michigan University press release. ""They're friendly and used to working 24 hours a day, whether in the country or city. Noise doesn't bother them — they just kept on munching even with the recent fireworks.""
In the complaint, AFSCME Local 1668 says the deal with Munchers on Hooves for goats to clear overgrown vegetation violates its collective bargaining agreement, the Battle Creek Enquirer reported. The university didn't notify the union that it was planning to use goat crews, according to a chief steward report obtained by the newspaper.
University spokeswoman Cheryl Roland told the Enquirer that the goats weren't brought on campus to cut grass, a union job, and that they tackle weeds and vegetation overgrowth that can be dangerous to humans, such as poison ivy. Goats are also environmentally sound, Roland said.
""Not wanting to use chemicals, either, we chose the goat solution to stay environmentally friendly,"" Roland said. ""The area is rife with poison ivy and other invasive species, and our analysis showed the goats to be a sustainable and cost-effective way of removing them.""
The goats aren't, well, fickle about flora species that can send humans racing to the doctor for antidotes, owner Garrett Fickle said.
""They're happy as long as they've got plenty of food to eat,"" he told WOOD-TV.
The lawsuit could be a foreshadow of litigation to come as goats gain traction in Michigan and around the county as a sustainable and economical way to clear overgrowth and do other landscaping jobs previously handled by human workers.
For example, the Ottawa County, Michigan, Parks and Recreation Commission has used goats in its land management program since 2014, and the University of Michigan Golf Course rented some last year for clean-up work, according to the WMU website. Goats also are happily grazing at major airports in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco, as well as at higher education institutions such as Clemson and Oregon State universities and the universities of Georgia and Wisconsin-Madison, WMU said.
Nick Gooch, a WMU horticulturalist overseeing the project, says it costs about $1,618 to clear a quarter acre using labor, machinery and herbicides, but using goats for the same job can shave $1,280 from the costs. The goats' effectiveness depends on topography and the variety of diversity of plant species, and in areas where vegetation is especially invasive and aggressive, two or three repeat grazings may be necessary.
Goats can also navigate steep slopes, ditches and stream banks, and they won't destroy beneficial plants if carefully managed to avoid overgrazing, Gooch said. They leave sites fairly clean, reducing the labor-intensive work to remove torn, tattered and uncut material, he said.
In June, AFSCME Local 1668 commented on its Facebook page about media coverage about the goats: ""Cute story. Too bad they didn't interview the 9 actual employees who are laid off without work or unemployment. Not so cute to a single mom without work.""

11,/michigan/grand-rapids/live-asian-carp-found-near-lake-michigan-officials,2017-06-23T20:17:03Z,Asian Carp Found Near Lake Michigan: Officials,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"TRAVERSE CITY, MI — A live Asian carp has been discovered in a Chicago waterway about nine miles from Lake Michigan — well beyond an electric barrier network designed to prevent the invasive fish that have infested the Mississippi River system from reaching the Great Lakes, officials said Friday.
The silver carp was 28 inches long and weighed about 8 pounds, officials with the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee said. It was caught Thursday by a commercial fisherman under contract with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources about 2 miles below the below the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam in the Calumet River, on Chicago's south side.
The location is 34 miles closer to Lake Michigan than silver carp previously were known to have reached, said Charlie Wooley, Midwest deputy regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Silver carp are among four types of Asian carp threatening to invade the lakes, where scientists say they could compete with native species, unravel aquatic food chains and devastate the region's $7 billion fishing industry. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
Even so, officials cautioned the discovery doesn't mean Asian carp have become established in the rivers and canals between the barriers and the Great Lakes, or in the lakes themselves. It's more likely the carp was a loner that somehow made its way into the Chicago area, Wooley said.
""This is concerning but it's not a three-alarm fire right now and we don't expect it to be,"" he said in an interview.
The fish carcass is being sent to Southern Illinois University, where biologists will attempt to determine where it came from, said Kevin Irons, the state agency's aquatic nuisance program manager. They will examine its inner-ear bones for chemicals that are characteristic of particular waterways, he said.
They'll also determine its gender and, if female, study its ovaries for indications of spawning.
Under a plan developed by the multi-agency coordinating committee, the find triggers two weeks of ""intense"" searching for others. Crews will use nets and electric stunning devices to comb the area where the silver carp was found, plus other sections of the Chicago-area waterways and Lake Michigan's Calumet Harbor.
This is the second time a live Asian carp has been found beyond three electric barriers clustered in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal 37 miles downstream from Lake Michigan. The other was a bighead carp caught in Chicago's Lake Calumet in 2010.
Bighead and silver carp are of special concern because of their voracious appetites for plankton — tiny plants and animals on which nearly all fish depend at some point in life. Silver carp are notorious for hurtling out of the water when startled, which can lead to bone-breaking collisions with people in motorboats.
The electric barrier system, operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is intended to prevent fish from swimming between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed. Federal officials say it performs well, although a study has found that juvenile fish might get pulled through when caught in barge currents.
Members of Congress from some states in the Great Lakes region contend the electric barriers aren't enough. They want barriers in the Chicago-area waterways to separate the lakes from the Mississippi system, a step opposed by Illinois lawmakers who say it would disrupt shipping.
The Army Corps was scheduled to release an interim report in February on measures that could strengthen defenses against invasive fish at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Des Plaines River in Joliet, Illinois, a choke point several miles downstream from the electric barriers. But the Trump administration has delayed making it public.
Lawmakers from Great Lakes states introduced bills this week that would order its release.
""The discovery of Asian Carp this close to Lake Michigan demonstrates how the window of opportunity to protect the Great Lakes is closing,"" said Rep. Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican.
The silver carp found this week was the first detected in the water past the barriers, Wooley said. Still, the main front for adult bighead and silver carp remains well downstream and is being thinned by continuous fishing, reducing the odds that enough will reach the lake to establish breeding populations, he said.
Environmental groups weren't satisfied.
""The lack of action by the administration is putting the Great Lakes at risk,"" said Molly Flanagan of the Alliance for the Great Lakes.

Court documents allege Schultz was a junior in November 2015 when he posted, ""Gonna shoot all black people ...... A smile tomorrow,"" on a social-media app.
He was expelled and arrested after another student sent the university a screenshot of the post, altering it to say only, ""Gonna shoot all black people.""
Schultz says the post wasn't a threat and he intended it to mean he was going to smile at black individuals.
The university says its response was appropriate given nationwide school shootings.
Criminal charges were dropped against Schultz, who is from the northwest Michigan city of Norway. The settlement awaits court approval.

McCloughan refused treatment and risked his life nine times to rescue wounded and disoriented comrades. Now, 48 years later, President Trump will present the 71-year-old retired high school teacher and coach with the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration.
Trump will present the Medal of Honor, the first of his presidency, to McCloughan during a ceremony at the White House on July 31.
McCloughan was 23 at the time and was serving with Company C, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 196th Infantry Brigade, Americal Division. He was wounded by shrapnel and small arms fire three times in the May 13-15 firefight, but he selflessly persevered, saving 10 soldiers' lives, the White House said. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts and newsletters from Grand Rapids Patch, click here to find your local Michigan Patch. Also, if you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
McCloughan didn't sleep, eat or drink from the time the campaign started on the morning of May 13 until after the last medevac chopper was loaded, and then he collapsed, his platoon leader, Lt. Randall J. Clark, wrote in a letter nominating him for the high honor, The Detroit News reported. Clark had tried to put McCloughan in for a Distinguished Service Cross but was told that honor wasn't available to a private first class. Instead, he received Bronze Stars with a ""V"" device for valor.
In an interview Tuesday, McCloughan said he is ""very humbled, very humbled,"" The Detroit News reported.
""And, of course — as many individuals who are blessed to receive something like this — I'm receiving it for all of my men,"" McCloughan said.
The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry above and beyond the call of duty while:
The meritorious conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life. There must be incontestable proof of the performance of the meritorious conduct, and each recommendation for the award must be considered on the standard of extraordinary merit.
McCloughan was drafted into the Army after graduating from Olivet College with a bachelor of arts in sociology and a teaching certificate. After Vietnam, McCloughan was discharged as a specialist five and returned home and spent nearly 40 years teaching and coaching sports at South Haven High School in Michigan.
He also earned a master of arts in counseling and psychology in 1972 from Western Michigan University.
McCloughan is a member of the Michigan High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame, the Michigan High School Football Association Coaches Hall of Fame, the Michigan High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame and the Olivet College Athletic Hall of Fame.
He is married to Chérie McCloughan and has two sons, Jamie and Matt, one daughter, Kami, and one stepdaughter, Kara.
