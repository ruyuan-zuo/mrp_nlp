The extension comes after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sent a letter to the president on May 27 urging him to extend the deployment as the state works to reopen its economy.
""The Michigan National Guard has been instrumental in our efforts to flatten the curve and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and will continue to play a vital role as we slowly and safely reopen our economy,"" Whitmer said. ""We need to keep working to expand testing and this extension will ensure we can continue to ramp up testing throughout the state. Moving too fast without the tests we need could put Michigan at risk of a second wave of infections.""

The Michigan National Guard has played a critical role in flattening the curve of coronavirus cases in Michigan by distributing personal protective equipment, food and medical supplies, providing warehousing support, disinfecting public spaces and assisting the Department of Health and Human Services with testing, Whitmer's office noted in a news release.
The extended deployment allows Michigan National Guard members to receive federal pay and benefits. The deployment was set to expire on June 24 due to a deadline set by the Trump Administration.
In addition to allowing Michigan to fully utilize the National Guard for recovery and reopening efforts, the extension means that many National Guard members will qualify for federal retirement and education benefits made available under the GI Bill. Without an extension, some National Guard members would not have been eligible to receive these benefits.
""The Michigan National Guard looks forward to continuing its work with Governor Whitmer in our state's response to COVID-19,"" said Maj. Gen. Paul Rogers, Adjutant General and Director of the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA). ""This approval allows Michigan National Guard members to continue to serve our communities and protect Michigan families."""

Whitmer highlighted the state's aggressive action against the coronavirus while testifying remotely.
""Since I first declared an emergency in response to this pandemic, my administration has taken aggressive measures to fight the spread of COVID-19, prevent the rapid depletion of the state's critical health care resources, and lower the chance of a devastating second wave,"" Whitmer said. ""We need the White House to create a specific, long-term plan outlining how the federal government will ensure we have adequate testing supplies so we can gather the data we need to make informed decisions about re-engaging our economies.

""As we re-engage Michigan's economy, we know it is crucial we do this incrementally,"" Whitmer continued. ""The worst thing we can do is to open up in a way that causes a second wave of infections and death, putting our front-line heroes at further risk and extending the economic crisis.

The testimony was delivered before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Whitmer called on the federal government to help states like Michigan ensure and promote widespread testing for the coronavirus. The governor also highlighted the state's efforts to secure personal protective equipment for front-line workers, expand testing capacity and eligibility and address health disparities in communities of color.
The governor also echoed her calls on the federal government to help states address the significant revenue shortfalls they are facing after dedicating resources to saving lives and protecting front-line workers.
""Right now, the language in the CARES Act does not provide states with the flexibility we need to address our revenue shortfalls,"" she said. ""A broader solution is needed to provide states with additional support and this critical flexibility. I thank members of the House for their work and hope that Congress and the Administration can come together to get it done.""

The Michigan Department of Treasury announced Monday that beginning June 15, some retailers will be reopening their bottle return facilities.
The announcement applies to retailers with bottle return facilities located at the front of the store or housed in a separate area and serviced exclusively by reverse vending machines requiring minimal or no person-to-person contact, the department said in a news release.
Retailers re-opening their bottle return facilities must ensure those facilities comply with all state-mandated safety protocols and restrictions, the department said in a news release.

In addition, retailers may take any or all of the following steps:
During this initial phase, retailers must limit the volume of weekly returned beverage containers to no more than 140 percent of their average weekly collection volume for the period April and May 2019.
Consumers have the option of recycling their returnable beverage containers if they choose not to return them to a bottle deposit redemption facility.
Treasury will issue further guidance regarding additional phases of the reestablishment of the bottle deposit program in the near future.
The collection of returnable beverage containers was temporarily suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. With the stay-home order being lifted and retail operations being allowed to reopen, the treasury department announced some would be reactivated."

The president is expected to arrive in Michigan around 1:40 p.m. and should arrive at the Ford Rawsonville Plant shortly after 2 p.m. His tour is expected to begin around 3 p.m. before he gives a statement at 3:20 p.m.
Trump's visit to the Ford plant is in part because the location makes ventilators for those needing them during the coronavirus pandemic, The Detroit Free Press reported. Ford Motor announced plans to produce more than 50,000 ventilators in March, and expressed the intention to have the ventilators completed and distributed by July 4, according to the Free Press.
Trump's visit has drawn some criticism because he has not addressed whether he will wear a face mask covering during the visit. The Free Press reported that while the visit contradicts rules put in place by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to stop the spread of the virus, she isn't planning to stop it.
""Ford and the UAW are doing incredible work for the country and their ingenuity will save lives,"" Whitmer's communications team told the Free Press. ""While the president's visit is contrary to the governor's order, this is an opportunity to showcase how important Michigan is to the response to COVID-19 and rebuilding our nation's economy.""
Trump, meanwhile, said he hasn't even thought of whether he'll don a mask while touring the facility, according to a report by Bloomberg.
While Ford Motor has a policy requiring all people visiting their factories to wear a mask, they are becoming a little more flexible ahead of the president's stop in Michigan, Bloomberg reported.
Prior to touring the Ford Motor factory, Trump is expected to meet with Detroit-area black leaders, according to a report from MLive.
The president's meeting will focus on efforts to help distressed communities recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the outlet reported. The meeting will take place outside the Ford plant and will include national African American leaders as well, according to MLive.
Thursday's visit will be Trump's third trip to a 2020 battleground state in as many weeks. The president visited a Honeywell N95 mask facility in Arizona May 5. Last week, Trump was in Pennsylvania, where he visited a facility that distributes personal protective equipment.
Trump's visit comes after he blasted Michigan election officials for mailing absentee ballots to registered voters, going so far as to threaten to cut the state's relief funding amid the coronavirus pandemic. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson corrected Trump in a statement, saying the state was mailing applications for the ballots, not the ballots themselves."

Shortly after, Benson's office responded.
The president tweeted that Michigan was sending absentee ballots to all registered voters. However, the state is not; it is sending applications for absentee ballots in case voters want to vote absentee in the wake of the pandemic.
""Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,"" the President tweeted. ""This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!..""
Just over an hour later, Benson's office responded in a news release offering a statement calling Trump's statement ""false.""
""The Bureau of Elections is mailing absent voter applications, not ballots,"" the statement said. ""Applications are mailed nearly every election cycle by both major parties and countless advocacy and nonpartisan organizations. Just like them, we have full authority to mail applications to ensure voters know they have the right to vote safely by mail.""
Benson also responded via Twitter.
On Tuesday, Benson's office made the announcement that applications for absentee ballots would be mailed to all Michigan residents who are registered to vote.
The move was made with the intention of providing voters with a safe way to cast their vote in the upcoming elections while concerns surrounding the new coronavirus continue.
""By mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,"" Benson said in a news release accompanying the announcement. ""Voting by mail is easy, convenient, safe, and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it.""
Of the 7.7 million registered voters in the state, about 1.3 million are on the permanent absent voter list, and their local election clerk mails them applications ahead of every election, Benson's office said. Some jurisdictions are mailing applications to all local registered voters. The Michigan Department of State's Bureau of Elections has ensured all remaining registered voters receive an application.
After threatening Michigan's coronavirus relief funding, Trump made similar threats towards Nevada, which sent ballots to voters for its June 9 state primary due to the coronavirus, the Associated Press reported."

""We know from the elections that took place this month that during the pandemic Michiganders want to safely vote.""
The May 5 election saw record-breaking turnout, with roughly 50 elections held across 33 counties and nearly 25 percent of eligible voters casting ballots and 99 percent of them doing so by mail or drop box, Benson's office said. From 2010 to 2019, average turnout in local elections in May was 12 percent.
The application mailing from the Bureau of Elections includes a cover letter with instructions from Benson. Once a voter signs their application, they can mail it or email a photo of it to their local clerk, whose contact information is included on the application. The application is also available for download at Michigan.gov/Vote. At the same website, voters can also register and join the permanent absent voter list so they always have the option to vote by mail.
""The vast majority of voters across the political spectrum want the option to vote by mail,"" Benson said. ""Mailing applications to all registered voters is one of the ways that we are ensuring Michigan's elections will continue to be safe, accurate and secure."""

As of Monday morning, Michigan has reported 51,915 cases of the coronavirus, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive announced Monday. Of those, 4,915 people have died. However, Khaldun noted, over 28,000 people have recovered from the virus as of Friday.
Despite the large number of cases, officials have said in recent weeks there is reason for cautious optimism as the number of new cases has plateaued. Monday's announcement of the reopening of some businesses in some sectors of the state adds to that optimism.
Earlier in May, Whitmer extended the statewide stay-home order to May 28, but allowed manufacturing workers to return to work. Prior to that, she allowed construction work to continue. The moves were early steps in reopening the state workforce.
Whitmer said businesses reopening in the northern Michigan regions are required to adhere to worker safety requirements mentioned in her MI Safe Start Plan. To ensure this, Whitmer signed an additional executive order requiring businesses to follow strict guidelines pertaining to the virus.
Under Executive Order 2020-91, businesses that resume in-person work must, among other things, develop a coronavirus preparedness and response plan and make it available to employees and customers by June 1.
Businesses must also provide coronavirus training to workers that covers, at a minimum, workplace infection-control practices, the proper use of PPE, steps workers must take to notify the business or operation of any symptoms of the coronavirus or a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of the virus, and how to report unsafe working conditions.
The decision to open also involves the respective region's local governments, Whitmer said, meaning if municipalities opt not to allow businesses to reopen they do not need to.
""We've confident that in some regions of the state, they've just not been hit as hard with COVID-19,"" Whitmer said. ""The data has shown in these regions of our state that we can phase more sectors into reengagement of our economy. When it comes to new cases per million percent of positive tests and deaths, these regions are far below the statewide average."""

The recession caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in Michigan is ""as bad or worse than"" the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, according to state Budget Director Chris Kolb, but Michigan will be able to weather the storm with sufficient support from the federal government.
State fiscal analysts and top economists from the University of Michigan presented their economic findings and projections to lawmakers Friday as part of the state's biannual Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference (CREC), which determines how much money the state has.
In January, economists painted a somewhat lackluster economic picture, but that was before COVID-19 hit the state. Now the bulk of the economic outlook for the next few years now depends largely on public health and epidemiology assumptions about COVID-19 and how the pandemic will continue to play out.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Michigan especially hard, which has done substantial enough economic damage to set that progress back for some time.
""We have seen some pickup in economic activity already, and we expect that to continue, but at a measured pace this spring and summer,"" said Gabriel Ehrlich, director of U of M's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE).
But an important part of that forecast is the assumption that there will not be a major ""second wave"" of COVID-19, or at least not a second wave that causes the same level of economic disruption as the first.
RSQE models estimate that assuming ongoing resumption of economic activity throughout May and June, there are still more than one million expected payroll job losses in the second quarter of 2020.
Dr. Daniil Manaenkov, a U.S. forecasting specialist for RSQE, said he hopes RSQE's models turn out to be pessimistic.
""Some businesses should not expect to rebound anytime soon,"" Manaenkov said. That timeline may be a year from now, if a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes widely available by then, or even later for certain businesses.
RSQE models also show that small businesses, and those who rely heavily on foot traffic for revenue (like movie theaters, bars, hotels and shopping malls) have taken a larger economic hit from the pandemic.
Michigan is now past its peak of state-imposed restrictions on businesses, although many still remain to protect against a second wave of COVID-19. At the point where those restrictions were the strictest, economics say about half of the state's businesses closed.
That led to a huge peak in weekly unemployment insurance claims in Michigan, which dwarfs that during the Great Recession.
Weekly unemployment insurance claims | U of M's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE)
Ehrlich says Michigan's high rate of unemployment, which peaked at about 22% (compared to the national peak of 17.4%) can be attributed largely to Michigan's more cyclical economy — which is due to the presence of Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers — as well as Michigan's relatively heavy burden of the COVID-19 outbreak.
""When the unemployment rate rises nationally, Michigan's unemployment rate also rises, but by more,"" Ehrlich said.
That record-high unemployment rate will likely not return to pre-2020 unemployment rate levels until after 2022.
Unemployment rate | U of M's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE)
Ehrlich estimates that about 70% of Michigan workers, with about 33% working remotely, were able to return to their jobs in April. However: ""An additional 550,000 workers were out of work because of the decline in demand,"" he said.
As for Michigan's overall pace of economic recovery, MSQE models show that Michigan will likely recover about 90% of this quarter's job losses by the end of 2022 — but this, again, is based on somewhat optimistic assumptions.
Overall, the auto industry has experienced a sharp drop in consumer demand due to fewer people using and purchasing cars during the pandemic.
In Michigan, vehicle sales from Detroit's biggest automakers were already on a slow decline before COVID-19. Those auto sales experienced an even sharper decline in 2020 with 13.3 million unit sales.
Those numbers are down from about 16.9 million in 2019, and are not expected to bounce back to 2019 levels until after 2022 – but are still about three million more units sold than in 2009.
Annual light vehicle sales | U of M's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE)
Going forward, future COVID-19 trends will continue to play a large role in determining public policy and economic shifts across the county — though predicting those trends are extremely uncertain and difficult to predict.
The national unemployment rate is expected to peak at 17.4% during the second quarter of 2020, which is much higher than the almost 10% reached at the height of the last recession.
However, that number is projected to jump back down quickly. Ehrlich said this is because most of the recent layoffs have been temporary in nature, meaning that many workers can expect to get their jobs back once it becomes safe to lift more business restrictions.
U.S. unemployment and labor force rates | U of M's Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE)
The RSQE assumes that restrictions on businesses across the country will be eased gradually, with new safety strategies put into place to help prevent a ""second wave"" of COVID-19.
Otherwise, service industries with the highest perceived risk of infection (e.g. eat-in restaurants, air travel, public transportation, concerts and sporting events) will take longer to rebound. The RSQE estimates the time for these industries to fully recover to be mid-2021."

The state budget is estimated to be $6.3 billion short in the next two fiscal years as state revenues fall due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and state leaders are hoping for a massive bailout from the federal government to help ease the damage.
State budget experts called the state's economic forecast ""sobering"" and ""unprecedented"" at Friday's Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference (CREC), where top officials from the Treasury Department and the nonpartisan House and Senate fiscal agencies agree to economic and revenue forecasts.
""To say that the numbers that we just saw are sobering is probably the understatement of my career,"" said state Budget Director Chris Kolb, a former state lawmaker. ""There's no playbook that's on the shelf to really address the loss of revenue of this size this quickly.""
Preliminary projections made in recent weeks pegged the two-year budget hole between $4 and $7 billion, so Friday's estimate falls on the higher end.
Michigan has two main discretionary spending accounts, the School Aid Fund that's primarily for K-12 education and the General Fund, which funds a variety of priorities, including roads, higher education, environmental protection, the Michigan State Police and safety net programs.
The General Fund is estimated to see a $2 billion drop in tax revenue for Fiscal Year 2020, which ends on Sept. 30, while the School Aid Fund will see an almost $1.2 billion decrease.
The per-pupil funding for K-12 students, which sits at a minimum of $8,111 per district for this fiscal year, is expected to see a cut of about $650 per student.
State Rep. Camilleri (D-Brownstown Twp.) said that a slashed budget could be even more detrimental to school districts amid a health crisis when parents may be pulling students from school based on health concerns.
""We want to maintain a level of funding for our school districts, but if all of a sudden not only are we seeing a budget shortfall, but then we see enrollment drop, then some of these school districts just won't be able to survive,"" Camilleri said.
Back at the January CREC, the state had a somewhat optimistic fiscal outlook with an overflow of about $700 million. The state was forecasted to have $321 million more in revenue for Fiscal Year 2020 and about $412 million more for Fiscal Year 2021.
Michigan's annual budget is roughly $60 billion.
But now, the budget hole is so deep that Kolb said he could completely eliminate 12 state departments and the budgets for the Legislature and judiciary branch, and the state still couldn't come up with $2 billion.
Michigan has about $1 billion set aside in a rainy day fund, but Kolb noted that won't cover the shortfall, even for the current FY 2020 budget.
""And what we're seeing is potentially as bad, if not worse, than the Great Recession,"" Kolb said. ""And we were only able to make it through that, because the federal government provided us resources, so we could backfill our losses.""
The Democratic-led U.S. House is expected to vote Friday on another COVID-19 relief package, the HEROES Act, that would include $1 trillion in aid for states and local governments, as the Advance previously reported.
However, President Donald Trump shot down the Democrats' package Wednesday, calling the relief proposal ""dead on arrival.""
But many lawmakers and stakeholders in Michigan are holding onto hope that the feds will provide aid.
""Just like every other state that's been ravaged by COVID-19, we will need a national solution to address this national problem,"" Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D-Flint) said in a statement.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has until September to work with the Republican-controlled Legislature to decide on budget cuts for the current fiscal year if Michigan doesn't receive enough financial assistance from D.C. to cover revenue losses.
The Legislature also only has until July 1 to get the Fiscal Year 2021 budget to Whitmer under a law signed after last year's rough budget fight.
""We are delayed in terms of receiving some of the information that makes us most comfortable in terms of making these forecasts,"" said Jim Stansell, a House Fiscal Agency senior economist.
Typically, CRECs take place in January and May. However, Stansell called for another revenue estimating conference in August or September to get ""one last estimate … after we have a chance to review the delayed returns to ensure we have a Fiscal Year '20 budget in line."""
14,/michigan/detroit/michigan-governor-signs-3-executive-orders-late-thursday,2020-05-15T14:06:53Z,Whitmer Signs 3 Executive Orders Thursday,0,1,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — Several executive orders were passed late on Thursday by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Whitmer extended a previously signed order that temporarily suspended evictions during the coronavirus pandemic. She also signed an order expanding telehealth options for Michiganders and another that provides relief from tax appeal deadlines.
Whitmer's extension of the executive order suspending evictions allows residents falling on hard times due to the coronavirus to not be subjected to the loss of their home.
""It's critical Michiganders can self-quarantine and continue staying safer at home without fear of being evicted,"" Whitmer said. ""This executive order gives renters and mobile home owners some peace of mind as we continue to flatten the curve.""
Executive Order 2020-85 ensures tenants and mobile home owners can remain in their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, even if they are unable to pay their rent. The order also relieves courts from certain statutory restrictions so they can stay eviction-related proceedings until after the coronavirus emergency has passed.
The order has been enforced as recently as April in southeast Michigan area, in which 80 people were prevented from being evicted from their apartments.
Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-86, which expands telehealth options for Michiganders by authorizing and encouraging health care providers to use these services when appropriate and after getting consent from patients. The order takes effect immediately and continues through June 10, 2020.
""Telehealth provides a way for patients to safely consult with their doctor and receive health care services while continuing to practice social distancing and limit potential exposure to COVID-19,"" Whitmer said. ""This Executive Order ensures Michiganders who need health care during this ongoing pandemic can still receive care while staying safer at home.""
Under Executive Order 2020-86, many health care services, such as mental health care, drug treatment and home health services may be provided via telehealth. Additionally, insurance carriers must cover virtual check-ins and e-visits, to facilitate the affordability of telehealth services.
Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-87, which provides an extended opportunity for individuals to dispute the assessed value of their property, extends certain equalization filing and meeting deadlines for local and county officials, and extends the deadline for filing petitions to appeal assessment determinations as to commercial and industrial property.
""With county offices closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic it's important to ensure business owners have an opportunity to appeal their property tax assessment and get questions answered, and for local and county officials to have more time to file reports,"" Whitmer said. ""This Executive Order extends several important deadlines ensuring we can continue to flatten the curve.""
Under Executive Order 2020-87, boards of review meeting in July will also meet to hear assessment protests for individuals who were not able to file protests in March. Additionally, the May 31 jurisdictional deadline to file a petition with the Michigan Tax Tribunal to challenge assessment determination to properties classified as commercial real property, industrial real property, developmental real property, commercial personal property, industrial personal property or utility personal property is extended to July 31.
The order, however, does not change or otherwise affect the July 31 jurisdictional deadline for assessment disputes of property classified as agricultural real property, residential real property, timber-cutover real property or agricultural personal property."

As part of state's involvement in the federal Unemployment Insurance Agency Work Share program, impacted state employees will take two temporary layoff days per pay period beginning Sunday until July 25, resulting in up to $80 million in decreased wage costs.
""As we continue to combat COVID-19, it's clear that we're facing unprecedented challenges that will lead to serious budget implications for the state of Michigan,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement. ""Utilizing this federal program keeps state employees working so they can continue to provide critical services to Michiganders and protects their paychecks so they can continue to support their families.""
This federal program allows the state to keep employees working with reduced hours, while employees collect partial unemployment benefits to make up a portion of the lost wages. State managers at the 17 level and above will not participate in the program but will take one layoff day every other pay period resulting in roughly a 5 percent reduction in gross pay. Over 31,000 state employees will be impacted.
Impacted employees will retain their health insurance and other benefits and will be automatically enrolled into the unemployment process to help ensure they have the support they need during this challenging time.
Last month, Whitmer announced she was taking a 10 percent pay cut and directed her executive team and cabinet appointees to take a 5 percent pay cut for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, the governor's executive office will participate in the work share program.
Wednesday's layoffs do not impact anyone working on the front lines of the state's coronavirus response. Law enforcement, the prison system, veterans' homes and other key health and human services all remain fully staffed with on-site employees, the governor's office said."
16,/michigan/detroit/michigan-ag-capitol-commission-can-ban-guns-building,2020-05-08T17:42:12Z,Nessel: Commission Can Ban Guns at State Capitol,0,2,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — The Michigan State Capitol Commission has the legal authority to prohibit the presence of firearms in the state Capitol if it so choose to do so, according to the state's attorney general.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the authority to make that decision is consistent with the current state of the law regarding guns in public buildings and sent a letter to the commission informing them of that.
""The capitol is a place for free expression of thought and debate,"" Nessel said. ""But the freedom of civil discourse does not imply the right to threaten others with harm or violence. In our current environment and as the chief law enforcement officer in this state, I am gravely concerned for the safety of both our legislative members and the public at large.""
During recent demonstrations at the capitol, many people protested the governor's stay-home order while carrying guns. The protests lead to some lawmakers and other capitol employees to express that they felt threatened and feared for their safety.
Nessel said the only way to ensure violence does not occur in the capitol is to not allow anyone outside of security and police to carry guns in the building.
""The employees at our capitol and members of the public who visit are entitled to all the same protections as one would have at a courthouse and many other public venues,"" Nessel said. ""Public safety demands no less, and a lawmaker's desire to speak freely without fear of violence requires action be taken.""
Nessel wrote in her letter to commissioners that the commission, which manages the capitol grounds and building, has the legal authority to ensure the ""safety of the visiting public, as well as those who carry out the People's work by prohibiting firearms within the Capitol building.""
Nessel said that the regulation of firearms generally stems from state statute, but the prohibition of firearms from public spaces does not need to originate from the Legislature.
The Michigan Supreme Court, for example, adopted an administrative order that bars firearms from any courtroom, office or other space used for official court business or by judicial employees without prior approval. That order applies to open carry of firearms as well, Nessel notes, as it was cited in a Court of Appeals decision in an open carry challenge to a school district prohibition of weapons on school grounds.
""The concept of 'open carry' in Michigan law does not provide the unfettered right to bring firearms into any public space,"" Nessel wrote in her letter.
The Supreme Court also ruled that state law, which preempts regulations by local units of government, does not apply to school districts. Therefore, a non-local unit of government — such as a school district, the supreme court or the Michigan State Capitol Commission — may lawfully impose regulations that impact firearms.
Nessel notes in her letter that residents are currently permitted to enter the Capitol while clad in body armor and armed with high-capacity loaded semi-automatic assault weapons.
""This is permitted during active legislative sessions and during moments of controversial debate where emotions and passions are known to run hot,"" she wrote. ""At the risk of stating the obvious, this is an absurdly dangerous combination that would cause the heart of any security expert to skip a beat."""

As the governor extended her order, Michigan experienced another day in which it reported fewer than 1,000 new cases of the virus. The state's case total is over 45,000.
Under the order, manufacturing facilities must adopt measures to protect their workers from the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures includes conducting a daily entry screening protocol for workers and everyone else entering the facility, including a questionnaire covering symptoms and exposure to people with the coronavirus, together with a temperature screening as soon as no-touch thermometers can be obtained. They must also create dedicated entry points at every facility and suspend entry of all nonessential in-person visits.
""Governor Whitmer has brought together leaders in business and labor to ensure our workers can return to the job safely,"" said John Walsh, president and CEO of the Michigan Manufacturers Association. ""The safety of our workers is our top priority, and I am confident that Michigan manufacturers are prepared to deliver on the worker protections included in today's order. We believe the manufacturing industry has a big role to play in Michigan's economic recovery, and we're ready to lead the way. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the governor to bring the manufacturing industry back up to full strength.""
Manufacturing facilities must also train workers on how the coronavirus is transmitted from person to person, signs and symptoms of the virus, steps workers must take to notify the business or operation of signs and symptoms of the coronavirus or suspected or confirmed diagnosis, and the use of personal protective equipment.

By Laina G. Stebbins - June 27, 2020
At long last, environmentally minded Michiganders got their wish this week as Canadian oil company Enbridge was forced to halt operations on its controversial oil pipeline, Line 5.
Attorney General Dana Nessel had called for, and was subsequently granted, the court-ordered shutdown on Thursday. That action, however, is only temporary. Long-term solutions rely on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's actions — although all roads still lead to the courts.
So what would it take to permanently make good on the now decade-old rallying cry to ""shut down Line 5?""

Environmentalists told the Advance that a combination of three steps would be the most effective at halting the Line 5 oil pipeline, which every day transports roughly 23 million gallons of oil under the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac.
Line 5 splits into two parallel 20-inch pipelines underwater that run from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace, just several miles west of the Mackinac Bridge. Jurisdiction over both the east and west leg of the underwater pipeline is held by the state through a 1953 easement with Enbridge.
""Barring action from the company itself, the final authority to shut down Line 5 will ultimately lie with the courts,"" Nessel spokesperson Ryan Jarvi told the Advance Friday. ""The Attorney General's office is pursuing that goal through her litigation, which has resulted in, at least, a temporary shutdown of Line 5.
""Should the circumstances necessitate future action by the state to shut down Line 5, those actions will likely end up before the courts either as a result of the state bringing its own claim or Enbridge challenging an action by the state,"" Jarvi said.
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy denied that any kind of Line 5 shutdown is necessary.
""We have not found any damage to either pipeline,"" Duffy told the Advance on Wednesday, adding that ""the west leg is 1,300 feet from the east leg and doesn't have any safety or integrity issues and was restarted after fully updating our environmental regulator, PHMSA.""

Whitmer spokesperson Chelsea Lewis did not respond directly to an inquiry about whether the governor plans to take either of the two avenues at her disposal, but said: ""The governor directed the Department of Natural Resources [DNR] last year to conduct a review of the easement, which is not yet complete.""
DNR spokesperson Ed Golder said in an email Thursday that the review is still ongoing, and the department does not have a timeline for its completion.
So what, exactly, would it take to force Enbridge's hand in shutting down both underwater segments of Line 5? Here are the three main actions environmentalists say need to happen. The first is already in the works.
On Monday, Nessel took advantage of the most significant option at her disposal as attorney general when she successfully called on circuit court Judge James Jamo to put a (temporary) emergency halt to both legs of the Line 5 pipeline.
In his decision granting the motion Thursday, Jamo wrote that Nessel ""retains a duty to protect public trust lands, and it is currently unable to do so as a result of [Enbridge's] failures. Furthermore … the danger far exceeds the risk of financial loss to defendants if the west pipe of Line 5 is shut down pending hearing and further related court order.""
Enbridge responded Thursday evening with a statement expressing its ""disappointment"" with the ruling, but indicated that it had complied and ceased operation in both legs of Line 5.
The motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction were filed in Nessel's ongoing lawsuit against Enbridge in the Ingham County Circuit Court, in Nessel v Enbridge Energy LP, et al., which ultimately seeks to decommission Line 5.
The grounds for Nessel's actions stem from decisions made by Enbridge following significant damage to one of Line 5's anchor supports discovered last Thursday. Enbridge initially shut down both legs of the pipeline, but did not wait for an OK from state officials before resuming operation of the west leg.
Whitmer's calls for a full shutdown and further information about the damage before proceeding were largely ignored by the company. Enbridge said federal regulators at the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) had no objections to Enbridge's plan to restart the pipeline.
Since Jamo has now granted Nessel's request, the timeline for further actions within the case depends on the pace he sets for subsequent proceedings. Oral arguments on Nessel's motion for preliminary injunction are currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.
The amount of time that Line 5 could stay shut down also hinges on the pace set by Jamo. Either way, the order legally forces both lines out of operation until Enbridge is able to appeal.
So, although this is the most significant action Nessel could have taken for a swift shutdown of both lines, it is also the most temporary option — and Enbridge has already signaled that it intends to fight the motion vigorously in court.
As for PHMSA's decision to let Enbridge reboot the west leg of Line 5, despite Whitmer's request for it to remain closed, much is still unclear.
A spokesperson at PHMSA's central region enforcement office declined to issue a statement on the record Tuesday about the decision-making process for allowing Line 5's operation to resume and said the agency is monitoring the situation.
PHMSA is housed under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and headed by Howard ""Skip"" Elliott, a former railroad executive who's a political appointee of President Donald Trump.
Elliott also has served as DOT's acting inspector general since May, when Trump fired his predecessor and others at inspectors general offices and appointed his own choices to oversee departments. Elliott's appointment, in particular, has come under scrutiny, as he essentially serves as a watchdog for the same department which houses the agency he leads.
Elliott has said he will recuse himself from any inspector general actions regarding PHMSA.
The next two courses of action to shut down both dual pipelines rely on Whitmer.
One of those is, again, in the courts.
If Whitmer joins Nessel's lawsuit to decommission Line 5, Nessel v Enbridge would be strengthened considerably, environmentalists say. It would also be a show of solidarity between two of Michigan's top officials against Enbridge's presence in the Great Lakes.
""That would strengthen the attorney general's case, as well as show unity within the state that the easement for this pipeline is no longer something that is in the interest of the state of Michigan,"" said Beth Wallace, a pipeline safety advisor and Great Lakes Freshwater Campaigns Manager at the National Wildlife Federation (NWF).
Environmental activists have long expressed disappointment about Whitmer's decision to hold off on joining the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Whitmer did not comment specifically on the subject.
Last year, Jim Lively of the Traverse City-based Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities told the Advance that this has been ""a point of frustration"" among his and other environmental groups in the state — especially as Whitmer (like Nessel) ran her campaign on a promise to shut down Line 5.
""The governor didn't choose to join that lawsuit … it would be much stronger if [Whitmer did], as opposed to just the AG suing on behalf of the state of Michigan. It's a stronger case if we have the governor with us,"" Lively said in September.
However, even if Whitmer does come on board, this option is by no means a guarantee. The final ruling could still be well down the road — and could ultimately end in favor of Enbridge.
In the case that Nessel does come out on top, such a ruling would translate to an orderly, court-ordered decommissioning of Line 5. That's about as permanent as it gets, but it's still far from being an immediate and guaranteed method of shutting down both underwater segments of Line 5.
That's where the third option comes in.
The third — and what environmentalists view as possibly the most effective option — involves Whitmer dissolving the original agreement that allows Enbridge to operate in the Straits in the first place.
That easement was agreed to by the state of Michigan in 1953, giving Enbridge (then known as Lakehead Pipe Line Company) the authority to transport oil across the public trust-protected bottomlands between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron as long as the company adhered to a set of rules ensuring the area's safety.
The agreement can be terminated by the state if Enbridge is found to have breached those terms and conditions. Based on the emergency situation caused by Line 5's significant anchor support damage and Enbridge's restart of the west leg without state input, there likely are more grounds to do so now than ever before.
And even if Enbridge reports to PHMSA rather than the state on matters of pipeline operation and safety, as the company has argued is the case, the 1953 easement explicitly puts Michigan in charge of both Enbridge's sitting location under the Straits of Mackinac and the company's due care of operating those underwater lines.
""The state can completely and wholly go after those two parameters, and the governor absolutely should,"" Wallace said.
Citing the emergency situation and Enbridge's violations of the easement, Whitmer could order the DNR to fully revoke Enbridge's easement with the state. Dissolving that agreement means Enbridge would no longer have any legal permission from Michigan to operate in the Straits and would presumably be forced to decommission those segments of Line 5.
""Because this is an emergency situation, Whitmer does have executive authority to have a similar situation play out that the AG is doing currently, where she can ask the DNR to set the pace to revoke the easement. And she can invoke emergency authority to call for the shut down,"" Wallace said.
Even then, it's possible that Enbridge stands its ground and refuses to comply by arguing that their jurisdiction falls within the PHMSA rather than the state. It is uncertain how the revocation could be enforced in that case because there is no real precedent, thanks to the uniqueness of the 1953 easement.
In an absolute worst-case scenario, Wallace said the Michigan State Police could be called in to forcefully ensure Enbridge's compliance.
""This is new territory. We don't have an easement like this in any other scenario,"" Wallace said. ""… [The Great Lakes are] held in public trust, so in order to even be in this location, they have to adhere to what is stipulated in that easement.""
To do that, Wallace said Enbridge also must ""view the governor as the keeper of that easement and the keeper of public trust. For us to see [Enbridge's] about-face on her authority in her jurisdiction is concerning. And I know that she is very concerned about their behavior as a company,"" Wallace continued.
There is a good chance that Whitmer's call for the DNR to revoke the easement based on immediate risk would also end up in the courts, but the emergency injunction that Whitmer would also likely invoke would mean at least another temporary court-ordered shutdown — like Nessel's — until an investigation occurs.
""I think it really comes down to the governor having to hold her ground and use her executive authority, as well as the management of our state,"" Wallace said.
A Whitmer spokesperson on Thursday did not rule out this possibility, only telling the Advance that the DNR is still in the process of reviewing the 1953 easement.
The governor had directed the DNR to conduct a thorough review of the easement last June after Whitmer's negotiations with Enbridge broke down, the company filed a lawsuit against the state and Nessel filed a countersuit against Enbridge. The DNR said this week the review is ongoing and there is not a set timeline for its completion.
Wallace said a combination of all three of the available options would put sustained pressure on Enbridge by the state and would be the most effective at shutting down both Line 5 segments. Either way, nothing is certain.
Sean McBrearty, legislative and policy director for Michigan Clean Water Action and campaign coordinator for the anti-Line 5 Oil & Water Don't Mix coalition, agreed that the second two steps need to be taken as soon as possible.
""Due to the ongoing threat that Line 5 poses to the waters of the Great Lakes and Enbridge's most recent violation of the due care clause of the 1953 easement by reopening Line 5 before even knowing what caused the significant damage last week, the time is now for Gov. Whitmer to join AG Nessel's legal actions and immediately order the DNR to revoke the 1953 easement,"" McBrearty said.
""The Great Lakes are at risk and Enbridge has again shown that they can't be trusted to act with the due care required by the 1953 easement,"" he continued.
After Nessel's action Monday evening, environmental groups and state officials sent out statements applauding her move, as did U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing), U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Dearborn).
Dingell announced in a statement Thursday that she led the Michigan Democratic congressional delegation in sending a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, urging a federally mandated order to keep Line 5 shut down until a full investigation can occur.
Many groups are urging Whitmer to take action, as well.
""Attorney General Nessel has lived up to the oath she took to protect the public trust waters and bottomlands of the Great Lakes, and we thank her for her leadership,"" said Mary Brady-Enerson, Michigan director of Clean Water Action.
""Governor Whitmer has likewise taken an oath to protect our Great Lakes. We hope she will uphold that oath and join the Attorney General's legal actions, as well as use her authority as Governor to revoke Enbridge's easement.""
One concern has been that many U.P. residents use propane from Line 5 to heat their homes in the colder months, which is one of Enbridge's primary arguments for continuing operation of Line 5.
After talks broke down with Enbridge last June and lawsuits began flying back and forth, Whitmer created by executive order the U.P. Energy Task Force. The panel is tasked with assessing the Upper Peninsula's energy needs and studying alternative sources of propane transportation to the U.P. outside of Line 5 dependence.
The task force's work isn't done, but it presented part one of its recommendations to Whitmer in mid-April. The next meeting is scheduled for 1 p.m. July 15.

Gretchen Whitmer Friday.
The order also creates the Eviction Diversion Program, which outlines a process for renters to get fast rental assistance or establish a manageable payment plan to keep Michiganders in their homes. Rental assistance under the Eviction Diversion Program will be available beginning July 16, according to a news release.
""No Michigander should have to worry about losing their home during a global health pandemic and, at the same time, landlords and management companies need rent from their tenants to sustain their businesses,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This innovative new program will save lives, save money, and save businesses by keeping families in their homes and providing immediate financial relief to landlords for back rent they're due.""

Under the executive order, $50 million of rental assistance will be made available in the form of lump sum payments to landlords in exchange for allowing tenants to remain in their homes, forgiving late fees and up to 10 percent of the amount due. Tenants whose back rent is not completely covered by the Eviction Diversion Program will be entered into manageable payment plans facilitated by Supreme Court Administrative Order 2020-17.
The program was created following the passage of Senate Bill 690, which passed unanimously out of both the Michigan House and Senate on June 17. The legislation appropriated $60 million in Coronavirus Relief Funding to the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity for the creation of a rental assistance program to assist tenants and landlords after the eviction moratorium concludes.

Jamo on Thursday granted Attorney General Dana Nessel's motion for a temporary restraining order requiring Enbridge Energy to cease all transport operations of its Line 5 twin pipelines, which carry crude oil and liquid natural gas in the Straits of Mackinac. The judge also ordered Line 5 disclose information in its possession related to the recent damage caused to the pipeline's eastern segment.
Nessel filed motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Monday after Enbridge's disclosure late last week of significant damage to an anchor support on the east leg of the Line 5 pipelines. The motions were filed in the parties' ongoing case, currently pending in Ingham County Circuit Court.
In a six-page order, the court granted Nessel's request and ordered that the east line of the pipeline remain shut down and that the west line, which is currently operating, be shut down as soon as possible. Both lines are to remain closed until a hearing on Nessel's motion for preliminary injunction is held on Tuesday.
""Enbridge has failed to provide the State with information about the cause of this significant development involving Line 5, and so I'm very grateful for the Court's decision today,"" Nessel said. ""While the fact that Enbridge reactivated one of the lines before consulting with the State is concerning, the fact that the company has failed to disclose the cause of this damage is equally alarming, considering the impact a breach in the pipeline could have to our state residents and economy. With the continued operation of this pipeline, the risk of severe and lasting environmental damage to Michigan's most important natural resource continues to grow every day.
""However, this ruling, while significant, is only a short-term fix,"" Nessel continued. ""If the lines are put back into operation, one mismanaged incident or accident would result in a historic catastrophe for our state. Work must continue toward complete removal of Line 5 from our waters.""
Enbridge reported the pipeline damage to State officials on June 18, and shut down both east and west legs of Line 5 to inspect the damage. The company failed to immediately provide the state with information surrounding the incident – including the cause of the damage – as requested by Whitmer in a letter sent June 19, Nessel's office said.
Enbridge then unilaterally reactivated the west leg of the pipeline Saturday, without first providing the state with an opportunity to discuss it, according to Nessel.
On Thursday, Whitmer's office also issued a statement on the order.
""Governor Whitmer applauds the court's decision to issue a temporary restraining order to shut down Line 5 immediately, following severe damage to an anchor support,"" the statement said. ""Enbridge's decision to continue pumping crude oil through the Straits of Mackinac with so many unanswered questions was reckless and unacceptable. Enbridge owes a duty to the people of Michigan and must answer to the state for how it treats our Great Lakes. The governor will continue working to keep our water safe."""

Nessel said Michiganders need to be aware that offers via social media to assist them with the benefit process are likely scams, and that the answers provided to unemployment-related questions may contain misinformation that encourages claimants to commit fraud.
""Our state has seen an unprecedented uptick in unemployment claims as a result of COVID-19. Delays in processing have caused a great deal of frustration for hundreds of thousands of Michiganders who are simply doing all they can to make ends meet, but I want to urge residents to stay alert when taking to social media for answers or advice,"" Nessel said. ""There is no guarantee that these answers have been vetted or that the individuals promising to help can actually do so. Do not under any circumstance pay a fee or offer up your personal information to someone on social media.""
Do not fall for scams
If a post is offering to help you with any portion of the benefit process for a fee, do not fall for it, Nessel said. There is no guarantee that the person behind the post actually intends to assist residents or can help them, and those who fall for scams may never receive the services they pay for. In addition, if a user offers to assist you and requests personal information, do not fall for it, Nessel said. This is likely an attempt to steal your personal information to commit identity theft and obtain the benefits that you are rightfully entitled to.
Inaccurate answers
The information provided on social media has not been vetted and may not be accurate, Nessel warned. While the answers may seem to provide quick fixes, you may ultimately be led down the wrong path. This could result in further delays in your receipt of benefits, the denial of benefits and in the case of fraud, administrative or criminal penalties.
To ensure you have accurate information and follow the proper channels, Nessel said to visit the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency's (UIA) website. Claimants can also call the UIA Customer Service line at 1-866-500-0017 Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and follow the prompts."

For the 11,824 workers who applied prior to May 1 and are still awaiting a decision on eligibility, the agency will pay out benefits, determine that the claimant is ineligible and communicate why, or deem the claimant unreachable after multiple attempts to make contact. Unpaid claims filed before May 1st represent only 0.5% of all claims, the state said.
""Our goal is to have every unemployment claim filed before May 1 resolved by the end of next week,"" said UIA Director Steve Gray. ""While most of our eligible workers have been paid, the unprecedented number of claims during this crisis means that there are still tens of thousands of real Michiganders needing one-on-one review to pay benefits. We know COVID-19 continues to cause fear and frustration for these families and we are working work around the clock and enhance our resources to quickly eliminate the remaining backlog and get every worker the emergency financial assistance they're entitled to.""
The UIA also provided an update on unemployment claims related to the coronavirus in Michigan. Since March 15, 2.2 million eligible claimants have applied for state and federal benefits, with over $14.3 billion in benefits paid to over 2 million workers, the state said. Over 94 percent of eligible claimants have received or are approved for benefits, according to the state.
The state reported that of the remaining unpaid claimants, most are flagged for potential impostor fraud. Currently, 90,000 unpaid claims are flagged as potentially fraudulent while 33,000 unpaid claims are held pending adjudication for other reasons.
The UIA has made adjustments to its claims processing system to more efficiently adjudicate claims, but in many instances, the agency still needs additional information from the claimant before a determination can be made. For eligible unpaid claimants, the agency will make attempts to contact them if needed. There remains a path for individuals to protest any determination made by the agency on their claim.
The agency will soon announce a target date to make a determination on claims filed after May 1"

Ware discussed the use of violence Thursday at a commission meeting and gave a presentation on the topic.
""With all the injustices going on, this is something we need to do,"" Ware, who sponsored the resolution, said in a statement.
Wayne County commissioners unanimously adopted the resolution, which also calls on the
Michigan Legislature to provide additional funding for police training.
Ware's resolution was inspired by worldwide protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African American man whose death led to criminal accusations against four Minneapolis officers, as well as similar events over the past decade, Ware said.
The resolution specifically urges police departments to:
• Ban chokeholds and strangleholds.
• Require officers to de-escalate situations before using force.
• Require officers to give a verbal warning before shooting.
• Require officers to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before using deadly force.
• Require officers to intervene to stop another officer from using excessive force.
• Ban officers from shooting at moving vehicles.
• Require comprehensive reporting of police encounters.
• Require officers to be trained to identify and recognize those who have mental and
physical disabilities.
• Review body camera and police car recordings as a form of accountability.
The resolution supports Michigan Senate Bill 945 and Michigan House Bill 5837, which
would amend the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards Act, to establish
minimum standards for the training and continuing education of law enforcement officers to
avoid incidents of violent or fatal encounters.
It also supports The Justice in Policing Act of 2020, H.R. 7120, recently introduced in the
U.S. House of Representatives to establish a national standard for the operation of police
departments and that would provide accountability for, training of and restricted use of force by
police officers.

By Ken Coleman - June 21, 2020
About 300 people attended a public tribunal on a sweltering 90-degree Saturday evening at Hart Plaza in Detroit where organizers stepped up their call for the police to be policed.
The newly formed group Detroit Will Breathe organized the effort designed to hear directly from protesters who have been arrested or harassed during the 23 days of demonstrations in Michigan's largest city. They began on May 29 following the Memorial Day Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, an African-American man. Four men charged in connection with the death have been fired from the force.
Lead organizers Nakia Wallace and Tristan Taylor wanted to have a public display, ask that all charges against demonstrators be dropped, and continue the call for the Detroit City Council to oversee an independent investigation of the Detroit Police Department.
""The purpose of this tribunal is to expose the excessive and dangerous use of force against citizens,"" Wallace said during the demonstration.
The tribunal was reminiscent of a mock trial held on Aug. 30, 1967, after the Detroit Rebellion, a response from the Black community to decades of police harassment and brutality by white cops. At the center of the 1967 tribunal was the police killing three Black teenagers at the Algiers Motel on July 25, but officers weren't charged. Civil rights icon Rosa Parks was among the judges.
At the Saturday event, Ellie St. Clair of Detroit said she had brought her 13-year-old daughter to a recent protest and found the police presence unsettling.
""So I grabbed my daughter's arm tight,"" St. Clair said. ""This was actually happening. When it came time to run our eyes began to burn. Our noses were overcome with smoke and it became increasingly difficult to breathe.""
Ellie St. Clair speaking at the Jay Bass speaking at the Detroit Will Breathe police tribunal, June 20, 2020 | Ken Coleman
""It was painful. It was terrifying. And the worst part, it was nothing that I could do to get my daughter to a safe space.""
Michael Stauch, a professor at the University of Toledo, was arrested by the Detroit Police on June 1 during one of the demonstrations. He argued during the tribunal that city residents have endured continual police harassment and brutality, even under Black mayors and police chiefs. In recent decades the Detroit Police Department has sought to carry out a philosophy known as community policing, a system of placing officers in particular areas so that they become familiar with neighborhood residents.
""The problem with community policing comes down to who counts as the community, and who is placed outside that community, and is subjected to the order of policing forces,"" Staunch said.
Detroit Will Breathe police tribunal, June 20, 2020 | Ken Coleman
""That is the problem with community policing,"" he continued. ""It maintains and enforces existing hierarchies of inequality as policing as always done.""
Jay Bass, a 24-year-old Detroit man, said he was disappointed in how the police reacted to protesters. He said that he was tear gassed and arrested. ""I really thought that I could die,"" he said.
""I was committed to making change happen,"" Bass continued. ""I am committed to making justice happen and what I understand at that point is the leadership in Detroit is [Mayor] Mike Duggan was committed. [Detroit Police] Chief [James] Craig was also committed. But they were committed to silencing us. They weren't committed to justice. They were committed to silencing us.
Baylee Huffman, a 20-year-old from Port Huron, said that a friend, Nadia, was injured by tear gas during a demonstration that they attended.
""We were turning around to leave, and they shot her,"" Huffman said. ""Turning around to leave. Turning around to run.""
Willie Burton, a member of the Detroit Police Board of Commissioners, attended the tribunal and supports the effort of Detroit Will Breathe.
""We expect for our police officers to be peace officers. Not an occupying army,"" Burton said.
Detroit Police Chief James Craig did not attend the tribunal.
""I respect the right of the protesters to express their views during tonight's public tribunal,"" he said. ""However, the protesters continue to fail to acknowledge the serious danger the city faced in those first few nights."""
31,/michigan/detroit/census-undercount-michigan-could-leave-billions-table,2020-06-19T19:18:46Z,Census Undercount in MI Could Prove Costly,1,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"As we pass the halfway point for taking this year's census, nearly two out of every five U.S. households have yet to respond to the survey, stoking fears that billions of federal dollars could be left on the table — dollars that fund crucial services including during the pandemic.
The new coronavirus erupted just as the 2020 census was getting underway. In the wake of mass layoffs and unprecedented economic damage, studies are projecting that more than 4 million people could be undercounted this year.
U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, a Democrat from New York City who represents one of the most diverse districts in the nation, is also anticipating an undercount, leaving her fearful for communities.
""Any mistake or inaccurate count we make becomes a 10-year mistake and affects our neighborhoods and communities for a very long time,"" Meng told The Associated Press this week.
The purpose of the once-each-decade count is to help determine where $1.5 trillion in federal funding goes and how many congressional seats each state gets.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's self-response map, 67.8 percent of Michigan households have responded to this year's census either online, by phone or by mail.
Nationally, about 61.5 percent of households have responded.
This means two out of every five households are still unaccounted for.
Should these households not respond, billions of dollars that fund crucial services before, during and after the coronavirus pandemic will be lost. Services include hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and dozens more.
Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.
Both the National Urban League and the NALEO Educational Fund have sounded the alarm that communities with large concentrations of black and Hispanic residents are trailing the rest of the nation in answering the 2020 questionnaire, AP reported.
A more detailed analysis of response rates in late May and early June conducted by the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center showed that neighborhoods with concentrations of black residents had a self-response rate of 51 percent, compared with 53.8 percent for Hispanic-concentrated neighborhoods and 65.5 percent for white-dominant neighborhoods.
These populations are also among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Young people and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, according to one study. So are women and people of color, Department of Labor data says.
This is causing outreach challenges for both the Census Bureau and organizations providing services to impacted communities.
The Census Bureau suspended field operations in March, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This also included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
The Census Bureau told the Associated Press on Thursday that it had finished dropping off questionnaire forms to almost all of the 6.8 million mostly rural households.
Organizations throughout the country have also put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media and telephone calls.
Fadia Mohama, census director for Commonpoint Queens in New York, told NBC News the organization previously got 300 people to fill out the government survey in a single day. Last month, it was lucky to get 50 to watch a webinar.
""I want to be positive and say that we are getting through to the community,"" Mohama told NBC News. ""A lot of people that we've talked to have said that now is not a good time because their family member is sick or they have just lost their job.""
Because of the pandemic, the bureau pushed back the deadline for finishing the 2020 census from the end of July to the end of October, and it asked Congress for a delay in handing over apportionment and redistricting numbers.
Census officials have encouraged Americans to respond to the decennial survey online, a first for the census.
In a move designed to cut costs and keep up with digital lifestyles, the census questionnaire is available at my2020census.gov. Americans can access the online questionnaire by using a 12-digit ID code included with their census invitation sent by mail.

This includes the clearing of over 200,000 of the 340,000 active claims with claimants' benefits resuming within days.
Over 100,000 of the 200,000 newly flagged claims were also cleared. In just the last week alone, the UIA has cleared a combined 150,000 active and new claims flagged for identity verification.
Over 93 percent of people eligible for benefits and who filed for the have received or are approved for benefits. Of the remaining 7 percent of unpaid claimants, most are flagged for suspicion of impostor fraud. Currently, 100,000 unpaid claims are flagged as potentially fraudulent while 37,000 unpaid claims are held pending adjudication for other reasons, the UIA said in a news release.

State unemployment insurance systems across the country have been targeted by well-organized criminals using previously stolen or false personal information. The U.S. Secret Service issued a national alert in May regarding an international criminal ring and the Inspector General of U.S. Dept. of Labor has warned that the criminal activity during the pandemic could result in a ""significant amount of fraud.""
In response, the Michigan launched an Unemployment Insurance Fraud Task Force, led by Attorney General Dana Nessel, to help identify, locate and prosecute criminals suspected of unemployment fraud. Working with law enforcement and fraud experts, the UIA developed additional fraud protections, including additional identification verification steps, with the agency placing a Stop Payment hold on more than 340,000 active accounts, the UIA announced.
With an additional 60,000 cleared active accounts announced Friday, coupled with more than 140,000 announced last week, the UIA has cleared more 200,000 active accounts suspected of fraud. The UIA continues to work through the remaining 140,000 active accounts to move eligible claimants back into benefits.

But Michigan's unemployment system, like other systems across the country, remains under attack. Over the last few weeks, tens of thousands of new claims filed are suspected of fraud, the UIA said.
The UIA has received over 58,000 reports of unemployment identity theft and fraud since March 15th, with more than 25,000 coming since June 1st. Over 90,000 of the more than 200,000 new claims flagged as potentially fraudulent have also been cleared, with around 110,000 remaining. No payments were previously sent to these new claims.
Working with fraud experts, forensic accountants and law enforcement, the agency said it is using data analytics and direct outreach to identify legitimate claimants and release benefits as quickly as possible."

The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don't protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBT people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school.
The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs.
Aimee Stephens, a Metro Detroit woman who was the focus of the first case about the civil rights of transgender people to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, died earlier this year at. She was 59.
Stephens had worked for nearly six years as a funeral director at R.G. and G.R. Harris Funeral Homes when she was fired for being a transgender woman, according to previous reports by the ACLU. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Aimee's employer engaged in unlawful sex discrimination when it fired her because she's transgender.
Stephens was cited in a statement Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer offered shortly after the court's ruling.
""Today, in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court confirmed what we already know – that nobody deserves to lose their job because of who they are or how they identify,"" Whitmer. ""This is good news for the countless LGBTQ+ Michiganders who have been fighting for equality for decades, and would not have been possible if not for one of the plaintiffs, Aimee Stephens, a brave Michigander who fought for transgender rights until the day she died.
""There is still more work to do. We must continue fighting to expand the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to protect members of the LGBTQ+ community and make Michigan a state where more people want to move to for opportunity. In honor of Aimee, take today to celebrate this victory, and tomorrow, let's continue fighting to ensure equality for all Michiganders.""
Dana Nessel, the second openly gay person elected attorney general of a state in the United States as well as the first openly LGBTQ person elected to statewide office in Michigan, said Monday's ruling holds a special place in her heart.
Oakland County Executive David Coulter said Monday's decision was ""an important step forward.""
""Today's historic Supreme Court opinion is a major victory for equality and fairness in our country,"" Coulter said in a statement. ""No one should be fired simply for whom they love, and today America took an important step forward toward a more just and perfect union. Oakland County is proud to support this right for all our residents.""

Matthew Schneider, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, has floated the idea of the government taking control of the union and has pushed for letting each member vote on its leadership.
The government's corruption probe has been embarrassing for the UAW. Ten union officials and a late official's spouse have pleaded guilty since 2017, including former President Gary Jones.
Some officials used union dues for golf, lodging and fancy meals, while others tapped cash from a Fiat Chrysler-UAW training center with approval from an FCA executive. Others took kickbacks from union contractors.
Dennis Williams, another former president, has not been charged but his California home was searched last summer.
In a joint statement Monday, the union and Schneider said current UAW President Rory Gamble will meet with Schneider June 30 in Detroit to start negotiations on changes for the union. ""Both men seek to work together to restore the trust and confidence of the UAW's membership in the union's ability to represent them,"" the statement said.
Schneider said he looks forward to working with Gamble to resolve some of the serious issues that the UAW has faced. ""The UAW's membership deserves our concerted push to bring about significant and important reforms,"" he said.
Currently the 400,000-member union elects its leadership by voting for delegates who attend a convention every four years. The UAW represents about 150,000 workers employed by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors, but it also includes casino workers, university graduate assistants and others."

By Laina G. Stebbins - June 12, 2020
Michigan has yet to spend $2.8 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds, and some legislators are hoping that Congress will allow that money to fill substantial budget holes.
So far, Michigan has received $3.1 billion in federal relief money through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. But as the Detroit Free Press first reported Friday, the state has so far only spent about $250 million of it — roughly 8% of what has been allotted, as the Department of Management and Budget (DTMB) confirmed to the Advance.
Michigan is facing a $6.3 billion budget deficit over the next two fiscal years. That gap includes shortfalls of $2 billion in General Fund tax revenue and $1.2 billion in the School Aid Fund for Fiscal Year 2020.
That's not far off from the amount left in federal funding. CARES Act dollars, however, come with strict requirements that the money can only go toward efforts specifically geared toward COVID-19 relief.
""Right now, the language in the CARES act doesn't allow states the ability to use federal funding for existing items in the budget that are affected by lost revenue,"" DTMB spokesperson Kurt Weiss told the Advance Friday.
""We really need additional flexibility on the use of existing federal funding so we can better address the budget shortfall, especially now knowing that Congress may not look at additional aid for the states until later in July. Our revenue shortfall is a direct result of COVID-19 and this is a 50-state problem that requires action,"" Weiss added.
Lawmakers this week put forward two resolutions that would urge Congress to change that. House Concurrent Resolution 26 and Senate Resolution 124 essentially request that Michigan be given more flexibility of use for the federal COVID-19 money, so those dollars can soften the pandemic's blow to the state government, local governments and schools.
There's some bipartisan support for that idea.
So far, the Legislature has taken little action to fix the FY 2020 budget or hammer out the FY 2021 budget. Senate Appropriations Chair Jim Stamas (R-Midland) said Thursday he doesn't expect to wrap next year's budget until August or September. The new fiscal year starts Oct. 1.
A number of FY 2020 supplemental bills have been introduced, but have not made it to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's desk — although there is a hope legislation will move next week. After that, the Legislature takes several weeks off until late July.
It's not clear what might make it in a final deal.
""The House, Senate and the governor's administration are working together on a plan right now. Conversations are ongoing,"" said Gideon D'Assandro, spokesperson for House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R-Levering).
Amber McCann, spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) also said that ""discussions on a supplemental are ongoing."" But she added that Shirkey ""is not specifically waiting for flexibility from the federal government."""

Whitmer signed Executive Orders 2020-118 , which extends the duration of protections for tenants and mobile home owners from being evicted from their home until June 30, and Executive Order and 2020-119, which extends protections for people housed in Michigan's county jails, local lockups and juvenile detention centers until July 9.
""By extending the protection against eviction for non-payment we can ensure that COVID-19-infected individuals and vulnerable populations can isolate in the safety of their homes while continuing to protect incarcerated persons in our prisons, jails, and juvenile detention centers,"" Whitmer said.

Executive Order 2020-118 also relieves courts from certain statutory restrictions so they can stay eviction-related proceedings until after the coronavirus crisis has passed.
Executive Order 2020-119 temporarily suspends transfers into and from Michigan Department of Corrections facilities unless jails adopt certain risk-reduction protocols. Many counties—including Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb, have already resumed transfers. The order also allows local officials more flexibility in releasing vulnerable populations who do not pose a threat to public safety.
Michigan has reported more than 59,000 cases of the coronavirus as of Thursday. The state has also reported more than 5,500 deaths due to the virus."

The lawsuit seeks compensation, civil fines and the cleanup and restoration of damages.
The suit was filed by the Department of Attorney General on behalf of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
""This suit seeks to hold the dam owners accountable for the damage they caused and recoup the money the taxpayers have spent responding to the ongoing emergency created by this devastating flood,"" said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. ""We know the owners of the dam, with their long history of neglect, are responsible for the dam's failure. We can see already the devastating results of their inaction. This suit seeks an order requiring the dam owners to pay to remediate the harm they caused, and to take action to ensure it does not occur again.""

The eight-count suit will be followed by a motion to compel Boyce to immediately comply with a state order to fully inspect potentially dangerous cracks and erosion in a damaged portion of the Edenville Dam still remaining to determine what steps should be taken to protect public safety, the AG's office said in a news release.
The suit also requests Boyce to repair damages to Michigan's natural resources, clean up discharges of debris and hazardous materials caused by the dam failures and pay civil fines and damages related to the disaster.
Federal regulators identified deficiencies at the dam as early as 1993, according to Nessel. Those deficiencies were well known to Boyce at the time they purchased the dam in 2004, the AG's office said in a news release. Boyce repeatedly failed to comply with orders by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to upgrade the dam through 2018, when the Commission revoked the company's permit to generate hydroelectric power.

The dam's spillway capacity was just one of those deficiencies. ""Thirteen years after acquiring the license for the project, the licensee has still not increased spillway capacity leaving the project in danger of a [probable maximum flood] event,"" FERC wrote in a 2017 compliance order. ""The licensee has shown a pattern of delay and indifference to the potential consequences of this situation. A situation that must be remedied in order to protect life, limb, and property.""
The license revocation shifted regulatory oversight to the state of Michigan in late 2018. The state was working to both ascertain the dam's compliance with state safety standards and to facilitate the transfer of ownership to a group of local stakeholders. Those stakeholders, organized as the Four Lakes Task Force, had a plan in place to upgrade the dam's spillway capacities, strengthen its embankment and make other repairs so it could regain the federal hydroelectric generating license.

The AG's office said the transfer of the dam to the Four Lakes Task Force was imminent when the failure occurred, and was a much faster path to improve safety than attempting to get the private owners through regulatory means to undertake the repairs. That process could have taken close to a decade to complete, but the task force's construction schedule was already underway at the time the dam failed. The state was providing technical assistance and a $5 million grant to assist in the repairs and the transfer of ownership to the Task Force.
""Recently, progress toward modernizing the dam appeared to be moving forward,"" said Liesl Clark, EGLE director. ""Tragically, it was not soon enough. At any point in the preceding 15 years, Boyce could have chosen to abide by federal orders and bring the dam into compliance. Unfortunately, they refused to make the improvements necessary to retain their federal license. EGLE, in partnership with federal and local officials, will now proceed with addressing the heartbreak and loss for thousands of Michigan residents who are victims of the dam's failure.""

By Andrew Roth - August 2, 2020
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones have the distinction of both winning elections to represent Michigan's 13th Congressional District in the 2018 midterms.
Now, the two candidates are headed for a rematch in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
Jones and Tlaib both ran for the seat after U.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-Detroit) resigned in December 2017 amid reports of sexual harassment. He died in 2019 at age 90.
Jones narrowly won a special selection to serve the remainder of Conyers' term – about five weeks – while Tlaib narrowly won the seat for a full term.
Both candidates made history at the time: Tlaib becoming the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress and one of the first two Muslim women in Congress, and Jones setting new precedent allowing her to serve her partial term in Congress without resigning from the Detroit City Council.
But in 2018, there were four other Democrats on the ballot; this year, Jones and Tlaib are the only two. The winner of the primary will almost certainly win the November general election for the heavily Democratic seat.
With all four former opponents – former state Sen. Coleman Young II, former state Sen. Ian Conyers, former state Rep. Shanelle Jackson and Westland Mayor Bill Wild – having endorsed Jones, that could make Tlaib a vulnerable target for a moderate primary challenge. (In fact, Slate called Tlaib the ""most vulnerable member"" of the Squad, a group of four progressive women of color elected to Congress in 2018.)
But Tlaib has one major advantage: She's now the incumbent. That often translates into higher fundraising and more national endorsements – like that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), several labor unions and multiple progressive groups.
""It's absolutely more difficult to unseat an incumbent, even when the incumbent hasn't really been a part of what you would consider a real level of deliverables for the district,"" said Marvin Beatty, a Jones campaign executive. ""First of all, it's the economics. The economics of the fact that most incumbents will have raised and had a couple years to raise the dollars they need to run a pretty efficient campaign.""
Tlaib has a commanding financial lead, having raised $2.2 million this cycle with roughly $913,000 left in the bank as of June 30, per the Federal Elections Commission. Jones has raised just $147,000 and has about $21,000 cash on hand.
Jones' campaign has criticized Tlaib as being more focused on increasing her star power than on helping her district.
""In the midst of this pandemic, being able to provide the appropriate internet access for children who are in the learning mode so that every household in the district is supported by internet and computers, those are the kind of things you're not hearing from Tlaib,"" Beatty said. ""She's not speaking on those kinds of issues. Which only indicates that she's separated from the district.
""Her interest is that she has an international presence. That's what she's working on, being able to reflect in the international marketplace, versus being recognized in the community for doing things that are important and significant in the community.""
But Tlaib says she has focused on issues like health care, climate change and structural racism.
""You all know it's not my name on the ballot. It's Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, fighting against structural racism, really truly trying to combat poverty in our country with the Boost Act, ending discrimination with the auto insurance industry, and really taking on the corporate bullies. So know all of that, right now, is on this ballot,"" Tlaib said in a video posted to Facebook. ""I can't wait to show our nation that this is what people want right now. They want real change and they want it now.""
Jones' campaign also argued that Tlaib's influence is limited by the fact that she is not a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, even though she comes from a majority African American district.
""You don't see the Congressional Black Caucus crossing over and supporting Rep. Tlaib, who is not a member, which means that her sphere of influence is five people in the Squad, versus being part of the Congressional Black Caucus where you have a considerable level of influence and respectability that comes out of that group,"" Beatty said.
But Tlaib said she has gotten results for her constituents, pointing to the fact that she has held two congressional hearings within the district on environmental justice and housing justice.
Pelosi endorsed Tlaib over the more moderate Jones, saying that ""her leadership has secured critical funding to stop water shutoffs and replace lead pipes,"" after an independent group backing Jones sent out mailers featuring a photo of Pelosi standing next to Jones.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced in 2019 that it would not grant contracts to pollsters, strategists, communications specialists or other operatives working with Democrats primarying incumbents in the 2020 election.
Beatty said those rules – created after fellow Squad member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) unseated now former Rep. Joseph Crowley in a primary two years ago – have made it difficult for the campaign to find support.
""It's been a real hurdle,"" Beatty said. ""We recognize that in many instances we would have gotten support from some of the traditional Democratic leadership or Democratic organizations, but we've been absolutely shut out of those opportunities."""

By Allison Donahue - July 31, 2020
The U.S. Census Bureau was supposed to wrap up its door knocking efforts at the end of October, but on Wednesday quietly moved that date up to the end of September — which could cut critical funding allocated based on census data for the state of Michigan.
NPR reported Thursday that the in-person interviews for the census will end on Sept. 30, rather than Oct. 31 when efforts were expected to conclude.
Kerry Ebersole Singh, director of the Michigan 2020 Statewide Census campaign, said she learned of the change in plans from media reports and is concerned that the shortened timeline will affect Michigan's overall count.
As it stands, without any in-person efforts yet started in Michigan, 68.7% of Michiganders have filled out their census form.
This is only a small increase of 1% from mid-June.
During a U.S. House hearing Wednesday, Democrats raised concerns that the push to expedite the census count could be part of a scheme from the Trump administration to get President Donald Trump the numbers by the end of 2020.
""President Trump and [U.S. Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are demanding the American people finance their political manipulation of our democracy,"" U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement after the hearing. ""Rushing the census to completion means that census workers will not have enough time to follow up on the non-responses, an essential operation designed to find and count the hardest to reach communities.""
When asked why and when the decision was made to change the date for door-to-door operations, the Census Bureau replied in a written statement to NPR: ""We are currently evaluating our operations to enable the Census Bureau to provide this data in the most expeditious manner and when those plans have been finalized we will make an announcement.""
The ""Michigan Be Counted"" campaign, a collaboration between the state of Michigan, U.S. Census Bureau and the Michigan Nonprofit Association, set out with a big goal of 82% participation for the 2020 census.
Because the participation rate is calculated differently than the response rates, that would mean the total response goal for Michigan is about 71.7%, Ebersole Singh said.
""Responses have slowed, and this is where the work of the census gets really hard, and why that door-to-door operation by the U.S. Census Bureau is so critical,"" she said.
Non-response follow up interviews pre-pandemic were expected to begin in May and continue to the end of June. Due to health and safety concerns, the in-person operations were rescheduled to start mid-August.
For much of the southern portion of Michigan, in-person interviews will begin Aug. 5, and for the rest of the state will begin Aug. 11.
""The U.S. Census Bureau cutting door-to-door operations from three months to six weeks is a big concern,"" Ebersole Singh said. ""I would say that also, we have dealt with a lot of uncertainty with a pandemic. But now there are additional questions as the U.S. Census Bureau moves the timelines around, so I fear that will create confusion.""
While this change in the timeline has thrown the campaign for a loop, Ebersole Singh said it doesn't change the mission.
""Our strategy after we saw where the state was at in May, we decided that we wanted to deploy about 90% of our resources by mid-August when the non-response follow up with this Census Bureau was scheduled to start,"" she said.
Now, with less time to collect census responses on the ground, the campaign is concerned how it will affect its efforts, especially in contacting ""hard to count"" communities in Michigan.
As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, ""hard to count"" communities are hard to locate, hard to interview, hard to contact and hard to persuade.
In both rural and urban areas, hard to count populations are usually composed of young people, racial minorities, people with low incomes, people experiencing homelessness and undocumented immigrants.
""We still want to encourage everyone to complete the census before someone comes to your door,"" Ebersole Singh said. ""So, this change from the US Census Bureau doesn't change that mission, if anything, adds urgency, and I think it also adds a moment for us to share additional innovative ways to reach hard to count communities.""
An unprecedented $16 million was allocated by the state Legislature for census outreach and participation, making it the largest census campaign in state history.
The census determines how much federal funding Michigan receives for public safety, health care, education, roads and infrastructure through 2030.
For every person that goes uncounted, the state could lose $1,800 of federal funds each year, according to the Council of Michigan Foundations.
It's unclear if Michiganders will still have until Oct. 31 to fill out the census online, by phone or by mail, but Ebersole Singh urges everyone not to wait.
""The biggest thing I want everyone in the state to understand is that being counted in the census is one way we get the resources back into our state we deserve and allocated representation for our population. It's really important. Don't wait for the deadline. Fill it out today,"" she said."

It's time for the president to get his priorities straight and work with Congress on a bipartisan recovery package that protects our families, frontline workers, and small business owners.""
Trump floated the idea of a ""delay"" to the election Thursday morning on Twitter. The president tweeted: ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???""
According to The Associated Press, the dates of presidential elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Trump has mentioned before his concerns with mail-in voting, suggesting it could lead to voter fraud and other issues. In May, he called out Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson without using her name after her office said it would send applications for absentee ballots ahead of elections held during the coronavirus pandemic.
""Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,"" the President tweeted at the time. ""This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!..""

Benson's office on Wednesday said it was taking extra precautions ahead of August and November elections, which included:
""For the past 19 months my administration has worked in partnership with local clerks and national experts to strengthen and modernize our elections system to meet the mandate of the voters,"" Benson said in a statement. ""That work has continued even in the midst of a pandemic, and our collective efforts have made it easier to vote and harder to cheat in Michigan.""
""These are truly unprecedented times, yet our clerks, the Bureau of Elections and my administration have all worked tirelessly to ensure voting rights are protected. No matter how you choose to vote next week and in November, know that our elections are secure, you will be safe, and your ballot will be counted.""

Gretchen Whitmer and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Monday issued a joint response to a threat by President Donald Trump to send federal law enforcement to Detroit to combat people demonstrating against police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd.
Trump made statements about sending federal law enforcement to the city while discussing cities across the nation.
""It is deeply disturbing that President Trump is once again choosing to spread hateful rhetoric and attempting to suppress the voices of those he doesn't agree with,"" Whitmer said. ""Quite frankly, the president doesn't know the first thing about Detroit. If he did, he would know that for nearly two months now, Detroiters have gathered to peacefully protest the systemic racism and discrimination that Black Americans face every day.
""There is no reason for the president to send federal troops into a city where people are demanding change peacefully and respectfully. If the president actually wants to help the people of Michigan, he can start by picking up the phone and telling Mitch McConnell to pass the HEROES Act, so we can provide immediate relief to Michigan's families, schools, and small businesses.""
Nessel called Trump's threat ""politically motivated"" and said it ""has nothing to do with with protecting public health or safety.""
""It is about using the power of his office as a cudgel to punish those who use their constitutionally guaranteed rights to express views he disagrees with,"" she said. ""Such threats undermine peace and stability in our communities by unnecessarily escalating tensions and encroaching on states' rights. We are a nation of laws, and the President's attempts to intimidate our communities with threats of violence could not be more un-American.""
Trump has recently deployed federal forces in cities such as Portland to suppress protests against police brutality. Trump described Chicago, one city that had large numbers of protests, as ""worse than Afghanistan.""
Early on Monday, federal law enforcement used tear gas to disperse groups of demonstrators near a federal court house in Portland, according to The Detroit News.
""The fact is (city police are) restricted from doing anything. They can't do anything. Well, I'm going to do something, that I can tell you,"" Trump said Monday. ""Because we're not going to let New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore ... we're not going to let this happen in our country.
""We're going to have more federal law enforcement, that I can tell you,"" Trump added. ""In Portland, they've done a fantastic job."""

By Ken Coleman - July 19, 2020
Union workers at several metro Detroit nursing homes plan to strike Monday as they face significant health risk during the COVID-19 pandemic, SEIU members said.
""Here in Detroit, us nursing home workers are at the center of the COVID-19 crisis,"" said Trece Andrews, who works at Regency at St. Clair Shores, a long-term care facility. ""We're putting our lives on the line every single day without proper PPE [personal protection equipment], paid sick days or fully-paid testing because facility owners treat us as disposable, not essential. Thousands of workers and residents have needlessly lost their lives. I've seen firsthand how this virus is devastating the Black community, exposing the systemic racism that has always existed.""
The effort is being billed as a ""Strike for Black Lives."" It will be a work stoppage at Hartford Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Lodge at Taylor, Regency at Taylor, Villa at Great Lakes Crossing, Villa at City Center and Regency at St. Claire Shores. The strike will culminate with a 2 p.m. action at the Hartford facility.
More than 50,000 nursing home residents and workers across the country have died from COVID-19, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reports that as of Friday, that the state has 7,508 confirmed COVID-19 cases among residents and 3,581 among staff in long-term care facilities.The department reports 1,983 deaths among long-term care residents and 22 staff deaths.
About one-third of the coronavirus deaths in Michigan have occurred in nursing homes. Michigan ranks 11th among states and the District of Columbia in the number of nursing homes deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's National Healthcare Safety Network. New Jersey; Massachusetts; Connecticut; Rhode Island; Delaware; Washington, D.C.; Pennsylvania; Maryland; Louisiana; and New York rank ahead of Michigan.
The top 10 states for cases are New York, California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, per the New York Times. Michigan has slipped to 13th after an extended lockdown in response to being one of the hardest hit states during the spring.
Residents and staff at long-term care facilities make up about 45% of national coronavirus-related deaths. Only seven states — Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Louisiana, New Hampshire, New Mexico and New York — have ongoing, required testing of residents, staff or both, according to a Stateline report.
Out of the 45 nursing homes in Michigan that have reported the most deaths linked to COVID-19, nearly half — 22 — have been cited by state inspectors in the last four months according to a Detroit News review of hundreds of pages of state records. Forty percent of total coronavirus deaths, which includes nursing homes and other sites, in Michigan are African American, yet Blacks compose just 14% percent of the state's population.
Workers are calling for increased safety protections such as masks and gloves.
They also want a $15 minimum wage for all service workers, an $18 wage for certified nursing assistants, an end to mandatory overtime and short-staffing, and improved benefits such as health care and paid sick leave. Michigan's current minimum wage is $9.65 per hour.
SEIU has been working to negotiate dozens of contracts with nursing homes in metro Detroit. It represents 66 nursing homes and more than 6,000 nursing home workers in Michigan. There are approximately 444 nursing homes in the state.
Nursing homes have The Trump administration in recent months has pushed for a suspension of federal rules for homes that receive Medicaid and that has relaxed training requirements for nursing home staff.
Prioritized nursing home testing began in April for every resident, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has reported. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday signed executive orders to protect nursing home residents and staff from the spread of COVID-19. She also created a bipartisan task force to address the issue.
""We have taken great strides here in Michigan to protect families from the spread of COVID-19 and lower the chance of a second wave, but it's crucial that we stay vigilant and work around the clock to protect our most vulnerable residents and those who have dedicated their lives to caring for them,"" said Whitmer.
""These actions will help our state protect more nursing home residents and staff in the case of a second wave. Moving forward, I will work closely with the task force and with everyone who wants to help us protect our most vulnerable communities, the heroes on the front lines, and our families from this virus.""
The Michigan Nursing Homes COVID-19 Preparedness Task Force will be charged, Whitmer said, with analyzing relevant data on the threat of COVID-19 in nursing homes, and making recommendations to her on improving data quality, and releasing periodic reports on its findings and recommendations. The task force must produce an action plan by Aug. 31.
Meanwhile, the National Governors Association, American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living have sounded off on what they describe as ""imminent outbreaks at nursing homes and assisted living facilities.""
""With the major spikes of COVID cases in many states across the country, we are very concerned this trend will lead to a dramatic increase in cases in long-term facilities,"" their letter reads.
An independent research by Harvard Medical School, Brown University's School of Public Health and University of Chicago showed the level of COVID-19 cases in the surrounding community was the top factor in outbreaks in nursing homes.
Over the last couple months, there's been a growing political debate on the issue. The GOP-led Legislature has been looking into COVID-19 and its presence in nursing homes across the state. A special bicameral panel on the Whitmer administration's coronavirus actions has convened several hearings on nursing homes.
The Michigan Senate has passed SB 956, sponsored by Sen. Peter Lucido (R-Shelby Twp.), that would require the state health department to identify facilities for the exclusive care of nursing home residents with COVID-19.
Some Republicans have blamed coronavirus spread in nursing homes primarily on Whitmer. They have argued that she should have acted sooner to provide directives that could have prevented COVID-19 spread such as mandatory testing.
Attorney General Dana Nessel last month sent a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis in response to its request that she investigate Whitmer's executive order relating to nursing homes.
""While I appreciate and share your concern for the impact of COVID-19 on the health and safety of our elderly population, I am curious as to why similar requests have not been sent to states with Republican governors,"" Nessel wrote.
As for the SEIU members, their strike effort next Monday is about fairness.
""I am striking for better working conditions across the board,"" said Robert Ruff, a certified nursing assistant at Regency in Taylor. ""Conditions at some of the nursing homes are not the best — they could do much better."""

The Eviction Diversion Program launched Thursday will coincide with Wednesday's end of the state eviction moratorium, which had temporarily halted residential eviction for missed rent payments.
""At a time filled with a lot of uncertainty, the Eviction Diversion Program offers some peace of mind for tenants and landlords,"" said Kelly Rose, MSHDA's chief housing solutions officer. ""We understand how important housing is as a foundation for success in many other areas of life. That's why we're committed to leveraging the EDP to preserve tenant housing in as many cases as possible across the state.""

As part of the program, an allocation of $50 million was set aside to help tenants and landlords resolve eviction filings with conditional dismissals. Tenants making up to 100 percent of area median income are eligible for the rental assistance. Participating landlords can receive up to 90 percent of a tenant's unpaid rent in one lump sum. In exchange, landlords must dismiss all late fees, up to 10 percent of the amount due, and allow tenants to stay in their homes.
Funding for the EDP comes from Senate Bill 690, which appropriated $880 million in federal dollars from the CARES Act. The Senate bills called for $60 million to be set aside to establish a rental assistance program – of which $50 million will be dedicated to rental assistance with the remaining $10 million covering case management, legal, and administrative costs.
MSHDA will administer the EDP through Housing Assessment and Resource Agencies, a statewide network of homeless and special housing needs service providers. HARAs are responsible for collaborating with local stakeholders to design an eviction diversion process that notifies tenants and landlords about the program and ensures eviction filings are resolved by conditional dismissals in as many cases as possible."

The AGs office said the 2016 borrower defense regulations established protections for student borrowers who have been misled or defrauded by predatory schools by providing borrowers an efficient pathway to get relief from their federal student loans, and creating robust deterrents for schools that engage in predatory conduct.
Under the Trump administration, USDE repealed the 2016 regulations and replaced them with new ones that make it difficult for victimized students to obtain financial relief, while rolling back critical oversight measures, Nessel said.
In the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the coalition argues that USDE's decision to repeal and replace the Obama-era regulations violates the Administrative Procedure Act, and asks the court to vacate USDE's new regulations.
""At a time when the Department of Education should want to make every effort to ensure student borrowers are protected as they seek an education, my colleagues and I are left with no other choice but to take Betsy DeVos to court,"" Nessel said in a statement. ""We are calling on the Department of Education to do right by student borrowers who get robbed by for-profit institutions, rather than to make it more difficult for them to seek relief by rolling back the protections already in place.
""We have seen thousands of Michiganders fall victim to the misconduct of for-profit institutions. That is reason alone to join in this fight.""
Investigations and enforcement actions by attorneys general have revealed the misconduct of numerous for-profit schools and helped secure relief for tens of thousands of student borrowers, Nessel said.
In the lawsuit, the coalition argues that USDE's repeal and replacement of the 2016 borrower defense regulations violates the APA.
In filing this lawsuit, Nessel joins the attorneys general of California, Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin."

According to a new study by Families USA, a nonpartisan consumer advocacy group, 5.4 million non-elderly Americans reported losing their health insurance between February and May.
The increase in the number of people uninsured is 39 percent higher than at any other increase on record, according to the study. The previous record was set in 2008-09, when 3.9 million people became uninsured.
An estimated 12 percent of non-elderly adults in Michigan are currently uninsured, according to the study.
""We knew these numbers would be big,'' Stan Dorn, the study's author who directs the group's National Center for Coverage Innovation, told The New York Times. ""This is the worst economic downturn since World War II. It dwarfs the Great Recession. So it's not surprising that we would also see the worst increase in the uninsured.""
The study takes a state-by-state look at the effect of coronavirus-related layoffs on adults younger than 65, the age at which Americans become eligible for Medicare. The study found that nearly half — 46 percent — of the coverage losses from the pandemic happened in five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York and North Carolina.
The study calls on Congress to include health care protections in any future coronavirus legislation.
Republicans are planning to use any future legislation as a way to redeem themselves with voters on health care, according to the Times. Their goal is to offer provisions aimed at meeting medical needs stemming from the pandemic.
The study also ties into this year's presidential campaign season, during which health care — and, in particular, the Affordable Care Act — is expected to be a major issue.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration has moved forward with efforts to persuade the Supreme Court to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. House Democrats, however, have countered the administration's move by passing a bill to expand it."

Michigan reported 610 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the case total to 67,237, according to data provided by the state. It was highest single-day increase in new cases the state had reported since May.
In addition, the state added 10 new deaths attributed to the virus, upping its death toll to 6,015.
As of Wednesday, Michigan ranked 12th in the U.S. in total coronavirus cases, according to data provided by the World Health Organization. It was No. 7 in the nation in coronavirus deaths. It had previously ranked as high as third in both categories.
While the state has seen an uptick, it has not seen the quick spread and growth of new cases other states, such as Texas or Florida, have seen. The total number of coronavirus cases in Florida rose to 213,794 earlier this week. Texas on Tuesday crossed the 10,000 mark in terms of new cases of the coronavirus, shattering the previous record by more than 2,000.
During her news conference Thursday, Whitmer said Michiganders need to do their part to prevent Michigan from putting up similar numbers. Whitmer said wearing a mask reduces the chance of spreading the coronavirus by about 70 percent.
""It took less than two weeks for Florida to go from 100,000 to 200,000 positive cases, and the cases there are still climbing,"" she said. ""That can happen very quickly anywhere in this country if we drop our guard statewide."""

Six feet (2 meters) of water entered the home, and though Hulse said she's lucky that the house she's lived in most of her life is still structurally sound, many other peoples' homes were destroyed, ripped from their foundations.
""Things aren't ever going to be normal again. There will be a new normal, I guess, but there's so much of the village that's getting torn down. Eventually, the look and feel of it will be different,"" Hulse said. ""It's just unfair and disgusting, watching these houses get torn down that I've been looking at my whole life.""
Hulse is among the 859 Sanford residents whose lives were upended when privately owned dams with a history of neglect failed in May, resulting in more than $200 million damage in Midland County.
When the floodwaters roiled the Tittabawassee River, much of the attention focused on the larger downstream city of Midland, home to Dow Chemical Co. But many in Sanford are still scraping up muck and debris as they wait to find out whether any government aid may come their way.
In mid-June, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer asked President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster, which would open up federal resources and financial support for the area. Michigan has not yet received a response to Whitmer's request.
Legislation to allocate $6 million in state funds to the Midland area, mostly for housing, is sitting in a committee, with the Legislature adjourned for the summer.
Hulse said that when the floodwaters hit, countless volunteers in the village went to work helping her and families like hers by providing meals and supplies, and removing debris.
""The mud was unbelievable. It was slimy and it left this film on anything,"" Hulse said. ""A lot of the stuff that you thought, 'Well maybe I'll clean this off and keep it,' you can't even, you can't.""
Sanford, being so small, has already spent more than its yearly budget on debris cleanup alone.
Emily Ricards created a Facebook page to organize volunteer work. Although state or federal government aid would be a huge help, Ricards said Sanford could not wait. Midland County has a history of salt and gravel mining, and local excavating companies are helping to clean up the debris.
""If we would have waited we'd still be sitting and in three foot of muck,"" Ricards said.
Many damaged houses were not in the floodplain and did not have flood insurance, Ricards said. Together with the Midland Foundation, which funds programming and services for the county, the Sanford Strong Facebook page has raised $210,000 to take care of the immediate needs of residents, such as food and housing.
Floodwaters reached nearly to the ceilings of businesses in the downtown area, preventing them from reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic with the rest of the state, said Midland attorney Angela M. Cole, who lived in Sanford for more than 40 years. She created a GoFundMe that has raised nearly $20,000 to help local businesses.
""It's very personal to me. I raised my three sons in Sanford,"" Cole said. ""When they went to college and came back, the first place they always wanted to go for dinner was Lanny's Restaurant, which is right in downtown Sanford. We celebrated birthday parties, their graduations, anything you can think of there.""
The goal is to keep people in the village, Cole said. Supporting businesses will make it easier for residents to stay or visit, which would build the tax base.
""I think it's better just to help than to sit back and wait"" for state or federal funding, Cole said. ""We're gonna be very grateful for it, but can it really help the amount of devastation? Maybe not, so maybe if we do our part, that will help heal some more.""

Ebony and local pastors held a Zoom news conference Friday morning, pleading for the release of Kilpatrick.
""We are respectfully calling upon you to consider freeing former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick,"" The Rev. Keyon Payton said in the news conference. ""My request for his freedom is simply meant to express our opposition to the excessive nature and length of his sentence. Mr. Kilpatrick's punishment of a 28-year sentence simply does not fit the crime for which he was convicted.""
Kilpatrick, 49, was Detroit's mayor from 2002-08. He was convicted in 2013 of racketerring conspiracy, fraud, extortion and tax-related crimes. The government called it the ""Kilpatrick enterprise,"" according to The Associated Press, a long scheme to shake down contractors and reward allies.
Kilpatrick has served only a quarter of his 28-year prison sentence. With good time credits, he's been listed for release in 2037, according to The Associated Press. Kilpatrick's sentence ties the record for the longest sentence in American history for an elected official, according to Ebony.
""This clear case of excessive sentencing is emblematic of the victimization of black men by the criminal justice system,"" Ebony wrote in a news release.
More than 20 people spoke during the course of the news conference, the latest of many efforts to release Kilpatrick. Other efforts have been spearheaded by Democratic state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo and Kilpatrick himself.
There was speculation previously that President Donald Trump would pardon Kilpatrick when he was pardoning a slew of former officials around the country. However, those rumors never resolved, in part due to political reasons, the Detroit Free Press reported previously.
In June, additional speculation surfaced after reports that Kilpatrick was set to be released from prison due to concerns surrounding the safety of inmates amid the coronavirus pandemic.
However, as of Friday, Kilpatrick remains an inmate in a federal prison in Louisiana, where he has been placed in solitary confinement after being identified as at high risk for contracting the coronavirus, according to Ebony.
""We're not suggesting today that there's not a price to be paid for mistake made,"" said Bishop T.D. Jakes. ""We're calling on the president and all those who have the power to reconsider the sentence, made in the heat of passion of an angry city to the detriment of a very young man who deserves and needs and opportunity to recycle his lies.""

A repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could leave about 23.3 million Americans — including 827,000 Michigan residents — without health care coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report.
Research from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, looks at what could happen if the ACA is overturned in the coming months. In an 82-page brief filed last week for California v. Texas, President Donald Trump's administration and 18 other states asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the ACA.
It's not a new venture – Republicans have made several attempts to fully repeal or cut parts of the law informally known as ""Obamacare"" have occurred since a Democratic-majority Congress enacted it and former President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010.
If a full repeal of the ACA had happened prior to the pandemic, more than 1.9 million Americans and approximately 720,000 Michigan residents would have lost health care insurance, according to the Washington, D.C.-based group. But nearly 3.4 million more Americans and 107,000 more Michiganders would lose coverage if the ACA was repealed during the pandemic, namely because the health crisis is shuttering the jobs and businesses that ordinarily provide insurance coverage.
""No action would be more damaging to Americans' health care than if the Trump administration achieves their desired goal of overturning the ACA in its entirety, which is exactly what they hope to achieve in this case,"" said Brad Woodhouse, executive director of the pro-ACA group Protect Our Care .
Through a 2017 tax bill, Congress eliminated income tax penalties meant for those who failed to obtain health insurance, thus scrapping the ""individual mandate"" portion of the ACA. But what remains in question is if that partial repeal — which scrapped financial penalties for remaining uninsured — invalidates the entire law.
Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in his filing that ""the remainder of the ACA should not be allowed to remain in effect.""
In December, the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals struck down that individual mandate portion of the law. However, it did not decide what parts of the law — if any — could be retained. The appeals court sent it back to a lower district court to decide if the remaining mandates had standing.
Supreme Court justices decided in March to hear oral arguments for the case in their 2020-21 term after refusing to do so on an expedited basis in the 2019-20 term. That means that it will not be decided before the November election.
It will be the third time the nation's highest court hears a challenge to the ACA.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is part of a coalition of AGs that has filed a brief supporting the ACA."

Gretchen Whitmer has not exceeded the use of her emergency powers, upholding a ruling made previously by a lower Michigan court.
Whitmer has used emergency powers often during the coronavirus pandemic, issuing executive orders and extending the state's declaration of emergency to make moves she said has helped keep residents safe during the crisis.
""Today the Court of Appeals handed the governor a complete and decisive win in her efforts to protect the people of Michigan from this once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic,"" Whitmer's press secretary Tiffany Brown said. ""This decision recognizes that the Governor's actions to save lives are lawful and her orders remain in place.
The court ruled that Whitmer's ""declaration of a statement of emergency, her extensions of the state of emergency, and her issuance of related EOs clearly fell within the scope of the Governor's authority under the EPGA.""
The 1945 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act gives state governors the ability to declare emergencies and take actions in such situations without lawmaker approval.
During the coronavirus pandemic, Whitmer has extended the state's declaration of emergency several times in order to continue to issue executive orders such as requiring masks and issuing a statewide stay -home order. The stay-home order was lifted in June. The current emergency declaration is set to expire Sept. 4.

""She will continue to do what she's always done: take deliberate, measured actions to protect Michiganders from this unprecedented threat,"" Brown's statement read. ""This lawsuit is a dangerous and costly attempt to take away the governor's power to respond to the COVID-19 emergency and save lives. We owe it to our frontline heroes who have been putting their lives on the line to pull together as a state and work as one team to stop the spread of this virus."""

The state had asked the federal government for the additional funding on Tuesday.
""This is good news for the thousands of Michiganders who are still without work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it's still a short term band aid that falls short of what's needed,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement. ""We need the president, Mitch McConnell, and Congress to put partisanship aside and pass a bipartisan recovery package that will help us save lives and get people back on their feet.

The UIA estimates that under the program, about 910,000 Michiganders would receive at least $300 per week in supplemental benefits. The program allows for existing Unemployment Trust Fund payments delivered by Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency to count as 25 percent matching funds required for participation. Eligible claimants will be paid benefits retroactive to Aug. 1.
It is unclear at this time how long funding for the program will last.
""This additional $300 a week will provide some much needed support to those who are still struggling to make ends meet during this time of extreme need,"" said Steve Gray, Director of the Unemployment Insurance Agency. ""Our goal now is to work as quickly as possible to implement this new program to get people the benefits they need.""
At this time, claimants do not have to take any action to receive the additional benefit amount provided by the program, the state said in a news release. The additional benefits will be added automatically for all claimants who are eligible to receive at least $100 in weekly unemployment benefit payments. This includes claimants receiving any type of regular unemployment insurance benefits as well as those receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits."

Gretchen Whitmer announced Wednesday in a news conference.
The funding will be used to help close the digital divide as students begin learning virtually and from home. It'll also go toward improving access to in-person mental health services, small group learning and child care.
""We've got to continue doing everything we can to protect our students and educators and support staff,"" Whitmer said Wednesday. ""And in order to do just that and ensure critical support for our schools, whether it's helping them access PPE or cleaning supplies or helping students mitigate the impacts of learning loss in districts that need it most, funding will go to Michigan school districts and other education related entities that have been hit most significantly by the COVID-19 pandeic.""

The coronavirus pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on Michigan's students and educators, with Whitmer saying those impacts have been felt especially in low-income communities. The state as reported more than 90,000 cases and over 6,300 deaths as of Tuesday, and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said the virus remains a constant threat. She also reminded residents to take precautions against other health risks, such as the flu.
""Focus on simple things that you can control right now,"" she said. ""Wear your mask. Wash your hands. Keep your distance and please get your flu shot this fall.""
The funds are meant for districts that are determined to be most significantly impacted by the coronavirus, Whitmer said. To ensure these districts are targeted, the framework distributes $60 million to school districts based on the number of students in high-need student groups, she explained.
Districts will receive funding based on their numbers of economically disadvantaged students, special education students and English language learners. To be eligible for funding, the school district's concentration of economically disadvantaged pupils, compared to total district enrollment, must exceed 50 percent.
The funding is required to be used toward improving connectivity, such as providing devices, internet access or access to remote services to students. It's also meant to help assist student mental health by improving access to services.
Funding could be used by districts to offer supplementary content and services to mitigate the impacts of learning loss. Teacher training and curriculum can also be assisted through the funding, the governor said.
Whitmer began her Wednesday news conference by discussing educators and commending them for, in many cases, going above and beyond for their students.
""Teachers across Michigan have been working hard to help their students get a great education from home,"" she said. ""It has not been easy, but our dedicated educators have been working around the clock to address the digital divide that students in low income communities in particular have been confronting.""
The governor said $5.4 million will be distributed to other education related entities, and will be distributed for statewide mental health services, public television learning resources, implementation of teacher professional learning practices and the Early On program to help reach more infants and toddlers through remote early intervention."

With the support of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Tuesday that Michigan will join the lawsuit, which is being led by the state of Washington and includes 13 states. The State of Pennsylvania is leading a similar lawsuit.
The lawsuit argues changes proposed and implemented by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy are unlawful, and that they threaten the timely delivery of mail to people who reply on the USPS for items such as medical prescription and ballots.
""Recent actions taken by Mr. DeJoy are unlawful and indicate an attempt to disrupt and delay U.S. Postal Service operations,"" Nessel said. ""For more than 200 years, the postal service has been a fundamental part of the fabric of this country. People and businesses rely on it to deliver critical medications, correspondence and goods. We filed this lawsuit on behalf of the people of this state to ensure they can continue to depend on a system that is an integral part of our daily lives, our economic well-being and our democratic process.""
Under federal law, changes to USPS operations that affect nationwide mail service must be submitted to the Postal Regulatory Commission and the public must be provided an opportunity to comment, Nessel's office said.
""General DeJoy never engaged in that process here,"" the lawsuit states. ""As a matter of substance, these changes will have a wide range of negative consequences that violate a diverse array of federal laws, from harming individuals with disabilities in violation of the Rehabilitation Act to disenfranchising voters in violation of the Constitution.""
The coalition is asking the USPS to request an advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission. It also seeks an injunction prohibiting USPS from implementing operational changes until it has an appropriate advisory opinion from the commission, and asks the Court to order USPS to rescind any changes it already illegally made without that opinion.
The lawsuit will be filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court Eastern District of Washington.
Since being named the U.S. Postmaster General in May, DeJoy has implemented several changes that Nessel's office said have resulted in or threatened to reduce efficiency and timeliness of mail delivery.
Nessel's office said those changes include eliminating overtime for USPS employees, reducing operating hours, removing mailboxes and decommissioning sorting machines.
In Michigan, Nessel's office said, several sorting machines have been removed from post office facilities in Pontiac, Detroit and Grand Rapids. The machines can sort about 270,000 pieces of mail per hour.
The Postal Service also recently notified states that it will end its longstanding practice of processing ballots as first-class mail — regardless of what type of postage is used. States and counties that use marketing or bulk-rate postage for their ballots could experience delays that may prevent some ballots from being counted.
First-class mail normally has a delivery standard of 2-5 days, and nonprofit marketing mail has a delivery standard of 3-10 days, Nessel's office said.
Michigan is joined in the suit by Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin.
""We are committed to combatting voter suppression, misinformation and intimidation, and ensuring that every eligible vote is received, tallied and reported,"" Nessel said."

Gretchen Whitmer announced at a news conference Friday.
The partnership has been titled the MI Mask Aid partnership and is part of the Mask Up Michigan campaign.
""This partnership is going to save lives,"" Whitmer said Friday. ""Wearing a mask has been proven to reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19 by about 70 percent. According to one estimate, if 95 percent of Americans wore masks between now and December 1, it would save 66,000 American lives.""

The project Whitmer announced on Friday is in partnership with her Michigan Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities, which is chaired by Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II. Gilchrist said the task force has uncovered racial disparities in the healthcare field in Michigan, where more than 90,000 cases of the respiratory illness have been reported and over 6,200 people have died.
He continued by saying he encourages regions across Michigan to create similar, localized task forces that can help address issues within their communities.
""Each action that we take on the task force has sought to make an immediate impact, as well as a long term impact for the people in our communities,"" Gilchrist said. ""But the most immediate thing all of us can do right now is wear a mask to slow the spread of this deadly virus.""
The free masks include 1.5 million from FEMA that the state has already sent to organizations that include local Community Action Agencies serving low-income residents, MDHHS offices, Area Agencies on Aging, homeless shelters and Native American tribes, the state said.
Another 1 million face coverings from FEMA and 1.5 million from Ford will go to low-income schools, the City of Detroit, Federally Qualified Health Centers, some COVID-19 testing sites and to many of the organizations.
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said several regions across the state have seen positive trends regarding the coronavirus.
""We continue to be cautiously optimistic that we are trending in the right direction as a state,"" she said. ""But the spread of COVID-19 continues to look differently by region.""
The Detroit region is at about 50 cases per million people per day, with 4.1 percent of those tests coming back positive, Khaldun said, adding that the numbers could be related to the counties surrounding Detroit; Oakland, Wayne and Monroe counties all have over 40 cases per million people per day, she noted.
""No one should have to worry about where to get a mask or how they will afford one,"" Khaldun said. ""And that's why we're making masks easily accessibly for those who are the most vulnerable.""
Anyone interested in receiving a free mask can find a distribution location by calling the COVID-19 Hotline at 888-535-6136 or looking up their local Community Action Agency online."

The first phase of the project will test technology and explore the viability of a more than 40-mile driverless vehicle corridor between Downtown Detroit and Ann Arbor.
""The action we're taking today is good for our families, our businesses, and our economy as a whole,"" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a news release. ""Here in Michigan, the state that put the world on wheels, we are taking the initial steps to build the infrastructure to help us test and deploy the cars of the future.
""As we rebuild our roads to ensure every Michigander can drive to work and drop their kids at school safely, we will also continue working to build smart infrastructure to help prepare us for the roads of tomorrow. In Michigan, where the health of our workers and our economy are directly tied to the health of our auto industry, we will continue this innovative work to secure our state's position as the automotive capital of the world.""
Cavnue will work with the Michigan Department of Transportation, the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity (LEO) and industry and local project partners throughout Phase One of the effort, which is expected to last about two years.
Phase One
The vision for the corridor is intended to create lanes that are purpose built to accelerate and enhance the full potential of CAVs and move people, Cavnue and the state said in a news release. To achieve this, Cavnue will work with regional partners to plan the roadway.
The project envisions connecting Detroit and Ann Arbor along with key communities and destinations along Michigan Avenue and Interstate 94 in Wayne County and Washtenaw County with an innovative infrastructure solution that allows for a mix of connected and autonomous vehicles, traditional transit vehicles, shared mobility and freight and personal vehicles.
The project will link key destinations including the University of Michigan, Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Michigan Central Station, according to the release.
During the feasibility analysis in Phase One, work will focus on technology testing and roadway design. Subsequent construction and implementation would be part of future phases of the project, to be determined following the initial 24-month period.
""This project, and the decision by Cavnue and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners to invest here, continues to reinforce that the future of mobility will be designed and built in Detroit and Southeast Michigan,"" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement.
Thursday's announcement took place in front of Michigan Central Station, which Ford purchased in 2018. The station will be the centerpiece of the innovation district, where new mobility solutions will be created and tested on smart infrastructure, including the Michigan Mobility Corridor.
""My vision for Michigan Central is to create an open mobility innovation district that solves tomorrow's transportation challenges and improves mobility access for everyone,"" said Bill Ford, executive chairman, Ford Motor Company. ""Building out a connected corridor cements Michigan as a leader in creating a more connected, autonomous and electrified future. We thank the state for recognizing the community and economic benefits and the importance of creating smart infrastructure across southeast Michigan.""
New Corridor Could Help Solve Transportation Issues
Officials said the corridor could be a step toward solving current transportation issues that stem from human error.
According to the Michigan State Police, there have been almost 10,000 fatal automobile crashes in Michigan in the last decade. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states 94 percent of crashes are attributed to human error.
""As the anatomy of vehicles continues to shift toward autonomous driving and electrification, Michigan has an opportunity to not only drive this evolution in the production of vehicles, but also in the very roads they drive on,"" said Trevor Pawl, Chief Mobility Officer of the State of Michigan. ""This groundbreaking project reinforces Michigan's current position as a global leader in mobility innovation, and it also keeps us moving forward on a path to more equitable, safe and environmentally conscious transportation in the state."""

The move, an attempt by the bureau to accelerate the decennial count amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, was confirmed in a statement by bureau director Steven Dillingham. On Sept. 30, the bureau will cease critical door-knocking efforts and will stop collecting responses online, over the phone, and by mail.
Earlier this week, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer criticized the move, saying it will hurt American families.
""These last-minute, under-the-cover-of-darkness changes to the constitutionally mandated count of every person living in Michigan and the U.S. threaten the accuracy of population numbers used to determine the distribution of political representation and federal funding for the next decade,"" Whitmer said. ""Cutting short operations by a month will seriously impact the ability of the US Census Bureau to deliver an accurate and complete count, and in turn hurt American families everywhere. This is a blatant attempt by the Trump Administration to exclude people of color, immigrants, renters, rural residents, and other members of historically undercounted groups from being counted in the Census.
""What matters for us now, over the next 7 weeks, is getting every Michigander to respond to the Census. I'm calling on all Michigan residents to complete the Census immediately, whether it's online, by phone, or by mail, to ensure our communities receive the hard earned resources we've earned.""
As of Aug. 6, roughly 4 out of 10 U.S. households have yet to be counted. The national response rate is 63 percent, a minimal increase from mid-June, when the response rate was 61.5 percent.
In Michigan, response rates are higher than the national average. To date, 68.8 percent of households in our state have responded to the census.
The last-minute timeline change leaves the bureau with less than two months to try to reach people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, renters, the homeless and low-income people — all of whom are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census and are also among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Should these households not respond, cities, counties, and states could lose out on billions of dollars that fund crucial services needed before, during and after the pandemic. This includes hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and more.

The announcement also comes after NPR first reported that the agency decided to cut short door-knocking efforts for the census.
Before the pandemic hit, census counts were originally supposed to be finished by the end of July. With support from President Donald Trump, the timeline to complete the federally-mandated count was extended.
However, the pandemic continued to plague the bureau with outreach challenges.
In March, census officials suspended field operations, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
Organizations throughout the country also put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media, and telephone calls.
Last week, bureau chief Dillingham signaled a shift in plans by telling members of Congress ""the Census Bureau and others really want us to proceed as rapidly as possible.""
Dillingham's comments came as the bureau quietly removed references to Oct. 31 — the previously announced end date for all counting efforts — from its website, NPR reported.
If your household is among those who have not responded to this year's census, it's not too late.
In a move designed to cut costs and keep up with digital lifestyles, the census questionnaire is available at my2020census.gov. Americans can access the online questionnaire by using a 12-digit ID code included with their census invitation sent by mail.

And when will these facilities be able to reopen around all of Michigan? The answer is still unknown.

The state of emergency should not be confused for the stay-home order, which was lifted in June. The state of emergency declaration allows state governors to make executive orders that affected the entire state.
As of Thursday, more than 104,000 cases of the coronavirus have been reported in Michigan. Over 6,500 deaths have been reported.
In early August, every region in Michigan saw an uptick in new cases which recently put Michigan past the 100,000 COVID-19 cases mark, state heath officials said in a news release. The state's percent positivity remains below the national average: in Michigan, 3.3 percent of all COVID-19 tests administered were positive, whereas nationally it was 6.1 percent. Michigan has a considerably lower percent positivity than surrounding states, according to the state.
Whitmer said that the science continues to show that this virus can affect everyone, including children. The governor's office noted that, in an alarming trend, both nationwide and in Michigan, younger people have constituted a growing share of new cases.
Officials reiterated the importance of wearing masks, socially distancing and washing hands."

According to the order, all gyms and pools that reopen must enforce strict safety measures. Gyms must require wearing of masks at all times, including times of exercise. Social distancing is also required during exercise sessions, and class sizes must allow six feet of separation between participants.
Spectators for indoor organized sports are limited to the guests of the athletes, with each athlete designating up to two guests, according to the order. For outdoor sports competitions, the event organizer is required to limit the audience to just guests of participants or to 100 people or fewer — including players, coaches and staff.
The MDHHS on Thursday also released guidance regarding organized sports, recommending against contact sports at this time, including football, basketball and soccer. It also cites the elevated risk associated with activities that involve ""shouting, singing, or breathing forcefully,"" and notes there have been 30 reported outbreaks associated with athletic clubs, teams, or athletic facilities.
The state also recommends frequent hand washing, not letting players share towels or players, clothing and other safety measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
""As we begin to start organized sports back up again, I urge school districts and athletic associations to do everything in their power to protect players, coaches, and staff,"" Whitmer said. ""That means carefully following the guidelines released today by DHHS.
""Going forward, we will continue to work with health experts to assess the risk associated with business sectors that remain closed.

Both Nessel and Benson's statements reiterated that voting twice is illegal, with Nessel adding that those who do so will be prosecuted.
""Let me be perfectly clear: voting twice is illegal, no matter who tells you do to it,"" Nessel said. ""The president's idea is a great one for people looking to go to jail. My office will prosecute to the fullest extend of the law anyone who intentionally flouts our election laws.""
Voter fraud is typically prosecuted as a felony in Michigan, and bipartisan legislation was introduced in the state legislature this summer that would codify it as a felony offense, Nessel said.
Trump made his controversial comments on Wednesday, suggesting that people in North Carolina stress-test the security of their elections by voting in person and via mail.
""Let them send it in and let them go vote, and if their system's as good as they say it is, then obviously they won't be able to vote,"" Trump said. ""If it isn't tabulated, they'll be able to vote.""
Benson said the election system has already been stress-tested by three successful elections this year. Each ""test,"" Benson said, proved the process is safe and secure.
""We have protections in place to ensure election officials track and verify every ballot they send and receive and in every instance we ensure that each person gets only one vote,"" she said."

Rick Snyder Endorses Joe...,0,4,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — Former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. In a USA Today editorial, Snyder wrote that he is a Republican vote for the Democratic Biden.
""I will continue to support and stand up for Republican policies and values, and support Republican candidates, but I will not support Donald Trump for reelection,"" Snyder wrote.
Throughout the editorial, which can be viewed here, Snyder criticized Trump. The first of Snyder's points is that Trump has not unified the nation. He also said Trump hasn't represented his supporters and those who voted for him in the previous presidential election.
""That is your job,"" Snyder said. ""I was at the nation's Capitol when Trump gave his inaugural address. I had hoped this first speech as president would be a message to unify a divided nation. Instead, I heard a speech directed at how he would help the people who supported him. And sadly, that is how President Trump continues to govern.""
Snyder noted the need for civility to be returned to the nation as well, adding that while Trump has not appreciated public policy matters and has ""lacks a moral compass,"" Biden has shown a desire to heal the nation, which is currently divided on major issues.
Biden, Snyder wrote, has shown strong moral character and empathy while seeming willing to listen to people whose views and perspectives differ from his own.
""We will not continue to be the greatest nation in the world if we can't get along among ourselves,"" Snyder wrote. ""We have only become more divided over the past four years. We need a leader who believes in civility and bringing Americans closer together.""
The announcement from Snyder came in conjunction with the launch of Republicans and Independents for Biden, a coalition of nearly 100 former and current officeholders, government officials and political operatives. The group is affiliated and funded by the anti-Trump Lincoln Project PAC.
The coalition is the latest group of Republicans supporting Biden to come out publicly as Trump comes under criticism for his handling of the coronavirus and race relations. Some backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. Snyder did not endorse a candidate in that race, when Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan in 28 years.
Former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who endorsed Biden at the recent Democratic National Convention along with former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is chairing the group's steering committee, which includes Snyder, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and at least 20 former members of Congress.

Further speculation surrounded whether Whitmer would address concerns surrounding fall sports in Michigan, football in particular. However, the news conference offered no news regarding the issues, other than Whitmer's promise that more information will come shortly.
""I think that there are leaders in various roles that are struggling to figure out what the right thing to do is,"" Whitmer said.
Students and school staffs have questions why Michigan student-athletes are unable to participate in sports when surrounding states are pushing forward with fall sports.
Michigan's Executive Order 160 requires people from different households to stay at least six feet away from one another during outdoor activities. It also limits indoor gatherings of 10 people or more, except in Regions 6 and 8. The requirements make high school football, volleyball and swim teams from competing across the state.
The Michigan High School Athletic Association allowed volleyball, boys soccer and girls swim competitions to take place in regions of the state that are in Phase 5 of the governor's MI Safe Start plan, but school districts in the rest of the state remain limited.
MHSAA Executive Director Mark Uyl released a statement Wednesday following Whitmer's news conference.
""The MHSAA has been in constant contact with the Governor's office seeking answers and direction for fall sports under EO 160 since that order was issued, expressing the urgency for these decisions on behalf of our member school students, staff and families"" Uyl said. ""This direct communication will continue and we will take Governor Whitmer at her word today that decisions will be made and shared with everyone very soon.""
Among those critical of Whitmer and the MHSAA is Detroit Public Schools Community District Superintendent Nikolai Vitti, who on Wednesday continued to show disappointment in state leaders on the issue.
""Does not appear that any announcements will be made,"" Vitti posted on Twitter. ""On the topic of fall sports, both @GovWhitmer and @MHSAA have failed student-athletes and families. Neither have led on the topic and it's embarrassing. Both should be blamed, namely the @MHSAA
for even cancelling football.""
Recently, Vitti wrote a letter to Whitmer and others requesting the fall football be reinstated, saying the decision to cancel the sport — which came shortly after the MHSAA said fall sports would continue as scheduled — was confusing.
""This announcement was made after you made strong public statements only a few days before stating the consensus was that players, families, and schools wanted to play throughout the state; teams, including coaches and players, were applying the right COVID safety standards; and that high school football was not comparable to college football considering the Big Ten's decision to move the season to the spring,"" Vitti said. ""After the surprising reversal to shift the season to the spring, vague reasons were provided, including rising concerns from Athletic Directors across the state with playing, limited audiences for games, and the lack of clear support from the Governor and the state health department.
""Factually, nothing changed from a player's health perspective or risk analysis from strongly stating football would be played to it being postponed,"" the letter continues. ""This has led everyone, including myself, to believe politics were played and that the MHSAA abdicated its responsibility to make athletic decisions and instead deferred to the Governor in closed door conversations instead of supporting student-athletes, coaches, and their families.""

Gretchen Whitmer met with White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx in Lansing Wednesday morning to discuss the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The governor also expressed her concerns with the CDC's abrupt change last week to discourage asymptomatic testing even among individuals who may have been exposed. The updated guidance runs counter to what is known of the coronavirus, Whitmer said, and jeopardizes the ability to safely return to school and work.
""I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with Dr. Birx as we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This virus remains a serious threat to our families, our frontline workers, and our economy, and what's needed is more support at the federal level to help us expand testing, ensure everyone wears a mask while in public, support our frontline workers and small businesses, and save lives.

During her meeting with Birx, Whitmer said she further reiterated the need for a national mask mandate she said could save thousands of American lives.
The governor also spoke with Birx about the role the Michigan National Guard plays in implementing Michigan's testing plan. The Michigan National Guard has been crucial in assisting the Department of Corrections with testing MDOC staff and people serving time in Michigan prisons, Whitmer said. To date, the state has also facilitated testing for over 40,837 residents and staff in nursing homes.
President Donald Trump has imposed a 25 percent state cost share for funding the Michigan National Guard COVID-19 response from Aug. 21 to Dec. 31, which Whitmer said places additional financial burdens on the state, making it more difficult for the Michigan National Guard to support the state's testing goals and save lives.
In her meeting with Birx, the governor said she requested the administration restore full federal funding for the Michigan National Guard to support Michigan's testing operations in vulnerable settings like nursing homes and prisons."

Part of a $20 billion community plan Huntington announced Tuesday, the Michigan plan was developed in cooperation with Whitmer and Michigan community organizations to ensure the bank's commitment reflects the needs of all people and businesses throughout the state, according to a news release.
""It's really great news for our small businesses and business owners who've been facing unprecedented challenge as we've navigated COVID-19 over these last six months,"" Whitmer said in a news conference Wednesday.

In the next several months, the bank will announce specific initiatives to support small businesses, consumers and communities, according to a news release. The plan will evolve as Huntington continues to listen and take action to meet the changing needs of Michigan's communities.
Minority-owned businesses — which have been particularly affected during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist — will be a focus of the partnership.
Gilchrist pointed out disparities in how Black-owned businesses have been assisted during the coronavirus. Gilchrist said that in Michigan's Paycheck Protection Program that assisted 785 Michigan restaurants, only one business had a Black owner.
Gilchrist cited research done at the University of Michigan that revealed that nearly half of Black Detroiters and a third of Latino Detroiters say they have lost their jobs or had their hours cut due to the pandemic. The study also suggested that 40 percent of minority-owned businesses ma not have the financial means to open again on the other side of the pandemic, Gilchrist said.
""The coronavirus itself does not discriminate, but it is a parasite that feeds on the inequities that are historic and that are current in our society,"" Gilchrist said. ""It is our generation's responsibility to address this head on.""
The partnership also aims to assist other small businesses in Michigan. Sandy Pierce, Huntington Bank's director of Private Banking, Insurance Agency, Vehicle Finance and Regional Banking noted that rural small businesses and urban micro businesses have been especially hard hit during the pandemic.
""Our commitment to Michigan's small businesses reflects the role they play in driving the state's economy and the foundation they provide for our economic health,"" Pierce said.
Huntington will work with community organizations across the state to implement its Michigan Community Plan.
""We're honored to work with many outstanding partners who share our commitment to building stronger communities throughout Michigan,"" Pierce said. ""Together, we can inspire higher levels of community engagement and deliver new opportunities for all the people we serve."""

82,/michigan/detroit/mail-voting-michigan-deadlines-how-get-ballot,2020-08-27T20:08:49Z,"Mail-In Voting In Michigan: Deadlines, How To...",0,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — More than 500,000 mail-in ballots went uncounted during the 2020 primary season nationwide, many of them because they were deemed incomplete or because they arrived too late.
The issue could grow: A record number of voters are expected to stay away from traditional polling places for the Nov. 3 general election because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead cast their ballots by mail.
To help ensure your vote is among those tallied in Michigan, follow this checklist:
With guidelines changing in many states, more than 80 percent of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election, by far the most in U.S. history.
That's a result of 20 states loosening vote-by-mail laws this year due to the pandemic. As of Aug. 25, data from The Washington Post indicates 100 million people will be eligible to vote by mail either with no ""excuse"" or citing fears of the coronavirus as a reason. Among them, 51 million people will be automatically sent a ballot in the mail and 44 million people sent an application for a mail-in ballot.
Only six states still require a valid excuse other than coronavirus fears to vote absentee. Five states had already conducted elections solely by mail even before the pandemic.
But will your vote actually count?
In the primary election, a study by the Post showed 534,731 ballots were nixed in 23 states, and NPR found even more — 558,032 in 30 states — in a similar study. In New York City alone, more than 84,000 mail-in ballots were tossed and lawsuits were filed over the legitimacy of the outcomes of some close races.
Millions of people will cast their ballots by mail for the first time in the 2020 general election. Pew Research numbers show the number of people who vote by mail had already been on a sharp increase for years. In 2016, more than 20 percent of voters nationwide voted by mail, a total of about 27 million.
Of the 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, officials found just 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people, according to Electronic Registration Information Center data analyzed by the Post. That equates to a 0.0025 percent fraud rate. The Brennan Center for Justice has described vote-by-mail fraud as ""infinitesimally small.""
Why are people concerned about a legitimate election with so few documented cases of actual fraud?
Partly, it's problems with the U.S. Postal Service. But equally troublesome are problems that exposed themselves during the primaries. The Post data shows more ballots were rejected in 23 states than the number of absentee ballot rejections reported in the 2016 general election nationwide, in large part because of mistakes in filling out the ballots.
That means a lot more opportunities for inexperienced mail-in voters to make mistakes — which Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says could pose a significant problem in the rejection rate come November.
""Experience matters,"" Smith told the Post. ""If you lack experience voting by mail, the odds of you casting a ballot that doesn't count will go up.""
To make sure your ballot is counted:
President Donald Trump, who voted by mail in the Florida primary and praised his home state's absentee voting system, has often said — with no supporting data — that the upcoming election will be the ""most rigged"" in American history due to the amount of mail-in ballots expected to be cast.
Legal cases are ongoing involving the Trump administration and several states over mail-in voting.
Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said if the election between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is close, the mail-in ballots will create ""a mess.""
""The two campaigns will be arguing over nonconforming ballots, which is going to run up against voters' beliefs in fair play,"" Stewart told the Post.
There's also growing concern over the governmental entity tasked with handling the influx of mail-in ballots.
Under Trump, the Postal Service has come under fire for increasingly slow service, mail backlogs and planned changes that some have feared will have an effect on their ability to handle the expected massive increase of mail-in ballots this year.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told senators on Capitol Hill in recent testimony he was unaware of certain changes at the Postal Service until they caused a public uproar. But he also said there are no plans to restore mailboxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed. His testimony raised fresh questions about how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of ballots for the November election.
In some places such as Chicago, vote-by-mail drop boxes will be installed so voters can avoid the lines at the polls and not have to worry about Postal Service issues.

Gretchen Whitmer as well as the governors of three other states that issued orders which may have resulted in the deaths of thousands of elderly nursing home residents.
Michigan, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania required nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients to their vulnerable populations, often without adequate testing, the DOJ said in a news release.
""Protecting the rights of some of society's most vulnerable members, including elderly nursing home residents, is one of our country's most important obligations,"" said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Division Eric Dreiband. ""We must ensure they are adequately cared for with dignity and respect and not unnecessarily put at risk.""

Whitmer responded to the DOJ's request Wednesday, saying it was a partisan move made by President Donald Trump's Department of Justice.
""Protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of our seniors and most vulnerable residents has been a top priority throughout this crisis,"" Whitmer said. ""The fact that this letter was sent during the middle of the Republican National Convention week to four Democratic governors should make it crystal clear that this is nothing more than election year politics by an administration that is more concerned with the president's re-election campaign than protecting Michigan seniors.
""We will review this letter and respond as appropriate, however, Americans would all be better served if the Trump administration stopped the partisan games and focused on delivering a real plan to defeat COVID-19.""
The department's civil rights division is evaluating whether to initiate investigations under the federal Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which protects the civil rights of persons in state-run nursing homes, among others. The DOJ is seeking to determine if the state orders requiring admission of COVID-19 patients to nursing homes is responsible for the deaths of nursing home residents.
On March 3, the Attorney General announced the Justice Department's National Nursing Home Initiative, a comprehensive effort by the department, that uses every available tool to pursue nursing homes that provide substandard care to their residents.
The DOJ is requesting from the governors the number of nursing home residents, employees and other staff who contracted the virus. It is also requesting the the number of people affiliated with nursing homes who have died.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday announced a state media campaign encouraging residents to get their flu shot, with the goal of giving 33 percent more flu vaccines this year.
""Preventing the flu will help us save lives and preserve the healthcare resources that we will need this fall to continue fighting COVID-19,"" Whitmer said during Tuesday's news conference. ""Every year, hundreds of thousands of people get hospitalized with the flu.
""So, when we all get our flu vaccine, we can help keep thousands of flu patients out of the hospitals, and prevent overcrowding.""

Last flu season, an estimated 3.2 million people in Michigan received a flu vaccine, the state said. The state has set a goal of achieving a 33 percent increase in flu vaccination this season, which means more than 1 million people over last flu season.
The vaccine is already available in some parts of Michigan, with an ample supply expected across the state and nation starting in early fall, officials said.
The flu vaccine campaign — Facing the Flu Together — will include multiple media sources including TV and connected TV, social and digital media, podcasts, print and radio advertising. Ads and messages will begin Monday and reach audiences across Michigan, including targeting the most vulnerable and at-risk populations.
Michigan also launched a flu vaccine website, with resources and more information soon to be added.
During the 2019-2020 flu season, the nation recorded 39 to 56 million estimated cases of the flu, 18 to 26 million medical visits due to the flu and nearly half a million flu hospitalizations. Despite its comparison to the common cold, the flu is a very serious and potentially deadly disease, especially for children, older people and people with chronic health conditions, officials said.
Last season, 187 children died from the flu in the United States, including six children in Michigan, officials said.
State officials continue to urge residents to take precautions against the coronavirus, as well.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is still a very real threat,"" Whitmer said. ""It is still very real all across the state of Michigan. It's a threat to our families, it is a threat to our healthcare workers and people on the front lines, and it is a threat to our economy.""
Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said hospital supplies are particularly crucial during the current pandemic, and warned that a bad flu season could cause problems.
""Given all we've been through with COVID-19 this year there is the need for us to preserve our hospital resources to fight a possible surge of COVID-19,"" Khaldun said."

The estimated outlook for the state budget over the next two years is more optimistic than it was back in May.
But revenues for Michigan's Fiscal Year 2020 are still down $926 million and they've dropped $2.47 billion for FY 2021, according to economists. The news comes as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and GOP legislative leaders are primed to hash out a new budget before the Oct. 1 beginning of the 2021 fiscal year against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a presidential election.
State budget experts met Monday afternoon for a rare August Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference (CREC), where top officials from the Treasury Department and the nonpartisan House and Senate fiscal agencies agree to economic and revenue forecasts. CRECs are typically only held in January and May, but leaders felt that because of the economic downturn another summer conference was necessary.
Chris Harkins, director of the Senate Fiscal Agency, said the estimates from the latest conference leave him ""cautiously optimistic.""
""But, in my mind, these revisions, while significant upticks from May, still show sharp declines from January,"" Harkins said.
During the May conference, experts were estimating that Michigan's budget would fall short by $6.3 billion over the next two fiscal years due to the hard economic hit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Michigan's budget is roughly $58 billion.
However, what experts found was that state tax revenues didn't take as significant of a hit as initially anticipated, largely because of federal COVID-19 relief funds sent to the state, stimulus programs and an increase of federal money for unemployment insurance benefits.
In May, the Fiscal Year 2020 budget was expected to fall short by $3.2 billion, but by August the shortfall was about $936 million. Whitmer and the GOP-controlled Legislature struck a deal to reconcile the FY 2020 budget last month.
While the relief funds helped soften the blow for the Fiscal Year 2020 budget, federal money isn't promised going forward.
The Democratic-led U.S. House approved a $3 trillion coronavirus relief package in May, but the GOP-led Senate hasn't passed another relief package, despite lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agreeing that another round of stimulus checks is necessary.
""We have not assumed additional federal assistance will be available due to the delay in its enactment, which is the main driver for the precipitous drop in revenues for Fiscal Year 2021,"" State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks said.
During the January CREC, before the COVID-19 pandemic forced businesses to close, caused thousands of Michiganders to lose their jobs and put some manufacturing companies to a standstill, the state was forecasting about $412 million in overflow for Fiscal Year 2021.
However, without more federal relief down the road, State Budget Director Chris Kolb said budget cuts will be inevitable.
""We need additional federal aid to help us manage through the devastating impact COVID-19 has had on our revenues or else we will be facing tough decisions about what essential services and programs to cut,"" he said. ""An additional federal stimulus package is a must to help our residents and businesses and to provide crucial support to state and local governments.""
But when it comes to federal bailouts going forward, not everyone in Lansing is on the same page.
""The Trump administration deserves our thanks for buying us some time with the federal response to COVID-19 – but in no way is federal money a permanent solution. It's not sustainable over time, and it would be an irresponsible approach for taxpayers and future generations,"" House Appropriations Chair Shane Hernandez (R-Port Huron) said.
Instead, Hernandez advocates for the governor to fully reopen the state's economy and reduce state spending in the upcoming budgets.
Time is running out for legislative leaders and the governor to come to an agreement on the Fiscal Year 2021 budget, which is due by Sept. 30 to avoid a partial government shutdown."

By C.J. Moore - September 13, 2020
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and a bevy of other Michigan Democratic politicians during a Saturday virtual rally conveyed support for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and called on residents to vote in the Nov. 3 general election.
The two-hour ""Vote Michigan"" event was organized by the Lansing-area affiliate of the Blue Brigade, a group who says their goal is to flip the White House, U.S. Senate and take back state legislatures from Republicans in 2020.
Biden appeared in a segment of the virtual rally, but made no specific reference to Michigan. The former vice president made a campaign stop in the state earlier this week.
Whitmer reiterated her support for Biden, but used part of her segment to tell viewers it's critical for Democrats to win back the majority of the Michigan House in 2020. Both chambers of the state Legislature are currently GOP-controlled. The entire House is up in November, but the Senate is not on the ballot until 2022.
Carl Levin, a retired U.S. senator, joined the rally to commend Whitmer for her handling of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, for negotiating with Republicans to plug a $2.2 billion hole in the state's Fiscal Year 2020 budget and for her response to a ""once in 500 years flood"" that occurred in Midland in May.
During her appearance, Nessel encouraged Michigan residents to register to vote, while Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack — who was nominated by Democrats last month to run for reelection to one of the high court's two seats — directed viewers to her campaign website.
The Supreme Court is currently divided 4-3 in favor of GOP-nominated justices.
Democrat Elizabeth Welch, a West Michigan attorney who's vying for another position on the court, told viewers to ensure they don't miss casting votes for the two seats.
""The state Supreme Court cannot be overlooked as the third branch of government. It's the final decision maker on laws, from criminal justice matters to civil rights to water issues in schools,"" Welch said. ""The court makes huge decisions that truly impact your life. It's extremely important that you flip over your ballot and vote the nonpartisan section.""
The two Republicans nominated for Supreme Court are Appeals Court Judge Brock Swartzle and attorney Mary Kelly.
U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing) urged voters to cast ballots for fellow U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.), who faces Republican John James in November.
""Voting is one of the best ways to make sure that we can help set the course, that we can chart the future we want to live in,"" said state Rep. Jon Hoadley (D-Kalamazoo), who is running against longtime U.S. Rep. Fred Upton (R-St. Joseph) in the 6th Congressional District.
Lansing City Clerk Chris Swope and Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum walked viewers through the steps of obtaining and casting an absentee ballot — a method of voting that's been used more widely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""When you receive your ballot, vote it, and send it back to your local clerk as soon as possible. You may mail it to your clerk,"" said Byrum, a Democrat who is facing off with Republican Joseph Werner on Nov. 3. ""Allow at least two weeks for the mail to get there and make sure you have sufficient postage. Better yet, though, you can hand deliver that voted ballot back to your local clerk or put it in their dropbox.
""If I may be of any assistance to you, please reach out to me via social media or email at clerkbyrum@gmail.com,"" she added.
Byrum last week asked Whitmer to issue an executive order allowing absentee ballots to be pre-processed by election clerks 24 to 48 hours before Election Day. Clerks anticipate a large, unprecedented wave of absentee ballots will be cast in the general election."

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Wayne County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in the 2016 election, working with ProPublica to bring you information on broken scanners and long lines at the polls in Brooklyn, the extension of voting hours in Durham County, North Carolina, due to technical issues, voting improprieties in Texas, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and much more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:

Gretchen Whitmer joined state education, business and labor leaders Thursday in announcing a program offering tuition-free college to more than 625,000 Michiganders who provided essential services while the Stay Home, Stay Safe order was in place from April-June 2020.
The governor said the program, named Futures for Frontliners, is the first of its kind in the nation, and urged those qualified for the free tuition to apply for the program.
""This initiative is Michigan's way of expressing gratitude to essential workers for protecting public health and keeping our state running,"" Whitmer said.

The program is a $24M investment funded by Governor's Education Emergency Relief Fund — part of the CARES Act, and supports the state's Sixty by 30 goal announced at the Governor's first state of the state address to increase the number of working-age Michiganders completing an a industry certificate, college degree or apprenticeship.
Whitmer said a more educated workforce is essential to helping businesses grow and to make Michigan a more competitive state to attract jobs of the future.
""The vast majority of good paying jobs continue to require at least some education beyond high school,"" said Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity Director Jeff Donofrio. ""Futures for Frontliners gives those who helped save lives and kept our communities operating during the height of COVID an opportunity to increase their skills and income and helps us close the state's skills gap. For Michigan's economy to recover and grow, its critical we continue to provide expanded opportunities to all.""

The governor also ordered the lowering of U.S. and state flags within the State Capitol Complex and on all public buildings and grounds across the state to be lowered to half-staff Friday.
""On this day nineteen years ago, in the aftermath of one of the worst attacks in our nation's history, Americans banded together and proved that love is stronger than hate,"" Whitmer said.

Rick Snyder's endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
In a post on Twitter, Trump called Snyder a RINO (Republican in name only), blamed him for causing the Flint Water Crisis and said he'd rather have the endorsement of ""Law Enforcement all over the Country.""
""The failed former Governor of Michigan, RINO Rick Snyder, who was responsible for the Flint Water Disaster (and I let him know it!), is now endorsing Sleepy Joe Biden, who doesn't have a clue!"" Trump Tweeted Wednesday night.
""Snyder, whose political career was ruined by Flint, hurt a lot of people in Michigan..."" Trump continued, ""... I'll take the Endorsement of Law Enforcement all over the Country, and Joe can have the RINO'S. This Snyder mess was made during the OBiden era - no wonder they're friends!""
Snyder has endorsed Biden in a USA Today editorial, writing that he is a Republican vote for the Democratic Biden.
""I will continue to support and stand up for Republican policies and values, and support Republican candidates, but I will not support Donald Trump for reelection,"" Snyder wrote.
Throughout the editorial, which can be viewed here, Snyder chastised Trump for dividing the country while Biden, Snyder wrote, has shown strong moral character and empathy while seeming willing to listen to people whose views and perspectives differ from his own.
""We will not continue to be the greatest nation in the world if we can't get along among ourselves,"" Snyder wrote. ""We have only become more divided over the past four years. We need a leader who believes in civility and bringing Americans closer together.""

Biden spoke in Warren, Michigan, on Wednesday, announcing a two-pronged plan that includes focusing on building and buying American-made products and creating American jobs.
The Democratic candidate used the opportunity to criticize Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, and said many campaign promises made by Trump turned out to be lies.

Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday signed an executive order clarifying a previous order she issued that required student-athletes participating in organized sports to wear face coverings while competing.
The new order specifies that a face covering must be worn at all times by athletes training for, practicing for, or competing in an organized sport when the athlete cannot maintain 6 feet of social distance, except for occasional and fleeting moments.
""The COVID-19 virus is easily spread through airborne particles and can affect everyone differently,"" Whitmer said. ""By wearing a face covering when proper distancing is not possible, athletes will be better protected from contracting the virus and spreading it to family members, frontline workers, and vulnerable populations.
""We cannot afford to let our guard down. As we continue to fight this virus, we need to make smart and informed choices so we can beat COVID-19 together.""

According to Executive Order 2020-180, athletes are not required to wear a face covering if they are swimming. Athletes competing in football, soccer, or volleyball, for example, are not able to maintain 6 feet of social distance as required and therefore would need to wear a facial covering.
""We are not out of the woods yet, and COVID-19 is still a persistent threat to our frontline workers, students, and families,"" said Chief Medical Executive and MDHHS Chief Deputy for Health Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. ""Individuals have a choice about whether or not to play organized sports. Since contact sports pose a high risk of transmitting COVID-19, MDHHS recommends that people should choose to avoid them. For those who do choose to play organized sports, we expect you to follow these strict safety measures and wear a face covering to reduce your risk and protect the health of your teammates, coaches, officials, and loved ones.""
More than 108,000 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in Michigan as of Wednesday, health officials said. But despite the growing number of cases, residents have been eager to get back a form of normalcy with high school athletics.
Last week, the governor signed Executive Order 2020-176 reopening Michigan's gyms and pools in those regions where they remain closed and allowing for organized sports practices and competitions to resume in those regions where they remain restricted, subject to strict protections meant to limit spread of the virus. The governor also signed Executive Order 2020-175 outlining strict workplace safety measures gyms and pools must follow to protect people from the spread of COVID-19.
Shortly after Whitmer allowed for fall sports to continue last week, the Michigan High School Sports Association approved the reinstatement of football.
""We are thankful for the opportunity for kids to get back on the field in all fall sports, and we appreciate Governor Whitmer providing that opportunity with Executive Order 176 ,"" MHSAA Executive Director Mark Uyl said at the time. ""We share the Governor's priorities of putting health and safety first, and the COVID-19 guidance and protocols designed by the MHSAA at her request have led to the safe starts in all sports across the state.""
Along with the prior order, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services released guidance on organized sports recommending against contact sports at this time. It cites the elevated risk associated with activities that involve ""shouting, singing, or breathing forcefully,"" and notes there have been 30 reported outbreaks associated with athletic clubs, teams, or athletic facilities.
MDHHS' guidance recommends mitigation measures organized sports teams may take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during training, practices, and competitions. These recommendations include frequent hand washing, not letting players share towels, clothing and other items."

""Donald Trump makes a lot of promises,"" Biden said. ""He promised that he alone could stop the offshoring jobs. He promised he'd bring back jobs (and) stop companies from leaving.
""He now hopes we don't notice what he said and won't remember.""
Biden announced his ""Made In America"" plan and said he would establish a tax penalty for companies that avoid paying U.S. taxes by offshoring jobs and manufacturing on items sold in the country.
""That could be done here at home by qualified American workers,"" Biden said. ""I'm not looking to punish American business, but there's a better way. Make it in Michigan. Make it in America. Invest in our communities and the workers in places like Warren. That's what this is about.""
Companies would pay a little over a 30 percent tax rate on profits, with a 28 percent corporate tax rate and the additional surtax, Biden said during his speech. The tax will also be added to call centers or services by U.S. companies located overseas but serving the U.S.
A tax credit would also be available for companies creating U.S. jobs, including a 10 percent advanceable credit, Biden said. The credit is available for companies revitalizing closed facilities and bringing jobs back to the U.S.
""Just like there are consequences for offshoring, there are rewards and incentives for creating good-paying jobs here at home,"" Biden said.
Biden referred several times to Michigan as the heart of the automobile industry, and he pointed out that his visit to the state came two days after the Labor Day holiday. He said unions built the economy, and he routinely mentioned the importance of the U.S. maintaining its strong world presence among manufacturers.
""I don't buy for one second the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past,"" Biden said. ""We have the most qualified workers in the world.""
Michigan GOP Chairman Laura Cox's view of Biden's economic plans announced Wednesday were dismissive. In a statement, Cox described Biden's plan as ""job-killing.""
""The irony of Joe Biden visiting Michigan right after Labor Day to promote his radical job-killing agenda is no doubt lost on him,"" Cox said. ""We know exactly what a Biden/Harris administration will look like for Michiganders — skyrocketing energy costs, destruction of manufacturing jobs, and an 'America Last' foreign policy. The people of Michigan won't be fooled.""
Prior to addressing his economic plans, Biden took time to commend Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on how she has guided the state through the coronavirus pandemic.
""If you're wondering what responsible, strong executive leadership looks like in COVID-19, just look at this executive right here,"" Biden said, gesturing to Whitmer. ""Governor, you've done an incredible job steering the people in Michigan through a turbulent time.""
Biden also criticized Trump for his response to the virus, referring to a report from journalist Bob Woodward in his new book, ""Rage,"" in which the president is quoted as downplaying the severity of the virus while reportedly knowing of its deadly nature.
""He knew how dangerous it was,"" Biden said. ""He failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.""
Biden currently has a 5-point lead over Trump in Michigan, just under a month ahead of the Nov. 3 election, according to a poll conducted by WDIV and The Detroit News. The poll shows Biden a 47 percent to 42 percent advantage, with 1 percent choosing a candidate from a third party. According to the poll, 7 percent of voters remain undecided.

Gretchen Whitmer requested a phone call with President Donald Trump to discuss the imposed state cost share for use of the Michigan National Guard for COVID-19 response, which federally funds National Guard activities and provides Guard members with federal pay and benefits.
Whitmer reiterated in a news release Monday that although Michigan continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, the president has still not responded to the governor's request.
""COVID-19 is still a very real threat to our state, and we need full federal funding for the Michigan National Guard in order to continue protecting our families and frontline heroes,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""Our Guard members have been vital to our COVID-19 response by testing thousands of people in communities across the state during the height of the pandemic, and will be crucial to our recovery efforts moving forward.
""The president should not be playing partisan games while people's lives are on the line. It's irresponsible and irrational to fully fund National Guard activities in some states but not others. We need the president to step up and do the right thing for Michigan families, our frontline workers, and our economy. I once again implore President Trump to fully fund the Michigan National Guard under Title 32 so our Guardsmen and women can continue to protect us from this deadly virus.""

The Michigan National Guard has performed widespread testing and screening in local communities, Michigan Department of Corrections facilities, and nursing homes throughout the state. United have also distributed personal protective equipment, assisted at food banks and supported public safety throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Title 32 authority has been granted to Michigan since March 30 at full federal expense. In August, Trump issued six memoranda, which extended Title 32 authority for 49 states and territories. The memoranda imposed a 25 percent state cost share for most states, but maintained full federal funding for Florida, Texas, Arizona, Connecticut and California.
Whitmer has repeatedly reached out to Trump to urge him to provide full federal funding for the Michigan National Guard through Dec. 31, including sending the president a letter on Aug. 12.
The Michigan congressional delegation has voiced bipartisan support for 100 percent federal funding for the Michigan National Guard, Whitmer's office said, noting that on Aug. 10, Congressman Fred Upton and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell led a letter signed by thirteen of Michigan's fourteen representatives to FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor urging the Administration to provide full federal funding for the Michigan National Guard COVID-19 response.
Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters have also called on the president to restore full federal funding under Title 32 authority."

By Allison Donahue - September 5, 2020
Census workers across the state have just under a month left to count every Michigander under a sped-up timeline.
In total, 85.1% of Michigan households have been counted in the 2020 census. Michigan is about equal to the national average for total households counted, which sits around 84.9%.
The census determines how much federal funding Michigan receives for public safety, health care, education, roads and infrastructure through 2030. For every person that goes uncounted, the state could lose $1,800 of federal funds each year, according to the Council of Michigan Foundations.
But according to new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, a few regions around the state are lagging in their rates of getting people who didn't initially respond to the census to complete it.
U.S. Census Bureau map of non-responsive areas in Michigan
""Michigan overall has done an exceptional job in responding to the census,"" said Kerry Ebersole Singh, director of the Michigan 2020 Statewide Census campaign. ""Now as we move into the final 30 days, we do have areas that are still trailing 2010 numbers. So this non-response follow up period where the Census Bureau is going door-to-door to collect responses for addresses that haven't yet responded is just critical for us getting to a complete count.""
The state is divided into five area census offices (ACO); Macomb County, Oakland County, Traverse City, Detroit and Lansing.
These ACOs follow up with households who have not yet filled out the census and make sure that all the registered households still exist.
The Oakland County ACO, which includes neighboring Livingston County, as well, has completed 80.1% of the non-response followup workload.
The Macomb County ACO, which includes the ""Thumb""-region of the state, Bay County, Shiawassee County and Saginaw County, has completed 68.4% of the non-response followup workload.
The Lansing ACO, which is composed of southern, western and mid-Michigan counties, has completed 51.7% of the non-response followup workload.
The Traverse City ACO, which includes the Upper Peninsula and most of the state north of Kent County, has completed 48.8% of the non-response followup workload.
The Detroit ACO, which is only Wayne County, has completed 46.9% of the non-response followup workload.
The U.S. Census Bureau will update this data at 3 p.m. every day through Oct. 6.
All three of these regions saw at least a 2% increase in non-response follow up completion since Wednesday, and Ebersole Singh said that's largely because door-to-door operations have ramped up as the deadline quickly looms.
In Michigan, non-response work kicked off in early August after being delayed due to safety concerns around door-to-door operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Then in late July, the Census Bureau quietly moved the end date for all census-taking operations from Oct. 31 to Sept. 30, as the Advance previously reported.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, along with seven other governors, wrote a letter on Aug. 18 to the Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce asking that they re-extend the national census collection and response deadline back to the original date.
However, it doesn't seem like that change will be coming.
The ""Michigan Be Counted"" campaign, a collaboration between the state of Michigan, U.S. Census Bureau and the Michigan Nonprofit Association, set out with a big goal of 82% participation for the 2020 census.
The majority of Michiganders who have filled out the census—70.2%— filled it out online, by phone or by mail, while 14.9% of households in the state were counted by census takers and other field data collection operations.
Because the participation rate is calculated differently than the response rates, Ebersole Singh said that they believe if Michigan reaches a total self-response rate of 71.7% then the state will be able to reach its total goal for the campaign.
Michigan's self-response rates have increased in the last month since door-to-door operations began statewide Aug. 11.
Flint and Detroit are two metro areas with lower than average response rates, but both cities are expected to hit the 50% self response rates within the next week.
Urban areas are considered hard-to-count communities, which are usually composed of young people, racial minorities, people with low incomes, people experiencing homelessness and undocumented immigrants.
City of Grand Rapids and Grand Rapids Public Schools (GRPS) leaders are hosting a press conference next to week to urge residents in the area to fill out the census, saying there is more than $1 billion at stake for the Grand Rapids community.
College towns are also seeing lower response rates, which was a concern for census workers in Michigan after schools and colleges closed in March due to the pandemic and many students left their college towns. However, most campuses have opened this fall.
But Ebersole Singh said that reaching the hard-to-count populations is a priority for the campaign in the next month.
""It very much is an all hands on deck moment as we watch the U.S. Census Bureau rush to complete operations, and we have been working with our communities and stakeholders around the state to also support our communities in getting to a complete count,"" she said.
This census campaign is the largest in state history with an unprecedented $16 million allocated by the state Legislature for census outreach and participation.
""While we have more work to do … this has really been an extraordinary story for Michigan, because we have communities, nonprofits, the business community, local units of government and the state government coming together,"" Ebersole Singh said. ""Everyone recognizes how critical this funding is. It is giving us a solid foundation as we face uncertain times, especially with all the challenges that we're up against right now."""

By Laina G. Stebbins
The Michigan State Police (MSP) Friday morning is rolling out new department accountability initiatives, including the creation of a citizen advisory council and a new website devoted to transparency in policing.
In an exclusive interview, MSP Director Col. Joseph Gasper told the Advance that the advisory body will help bridge the gap between law enforcement and the communities they serve — while releasing internal data, including use-of-force incidents and traffic stops, will create a new layer of transparency and allow racial disparities to be identified and addressed.
The idea to create the advisory board had been in the works since 2019, when Gasper was appointed MSP director by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But this year's resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement against systemic police brutality further highlighted the department's need to hear from and listen to the people it serves, Gasper said.
""I think it's very important that we pay attention to our current environment,"" Gasper told the Advance. ""… At the end of the day, law enforcement really has the authority that the public wants to give it. And during this time of cultural transformation, citizen advisory groups like this play a very important role in making sure that we're listening and having that dialogue at all levels.""
The Bridges to BLUE (Build, Listen, Unite, Engage) Citizen Advisory Council is composed of 10 citizen volunteers from all corners of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Members range from middle school principals to religious leaders to business owners.
Although a citizen advisory board for a city or university police department is not unusual, few states have one for their statewide police force. Gasper said the board members were chosen with diversity (of race, age and geography) in mind to get a full breadth of perspectives from across the state.
""What we anticipate is getting a very community-based perspective and a free exchange of ideas, so that as we are navigating through reforms. … We can hear from various parts of the communities in order to make the best decisions and understand the impact of what we're trying to accomplish,"" Gasper said.
The new accompanying data website will now detail MSP policies, training requirements, recruiting and staffing numbers, use-of-force and traffic stop data and more.
""We are trying to be as transparent as possible,"" Gasper said.
The data goes back until 2011, although it is more polished starting in 2015. The department plans to update the numbers at least once a year — more often, if possible.
The hope is that by making the data publicly available in one place, the MSP can build more trust with residents while taking a closer look at its own practices.
""The traffic stop data might get some attention,"" Gasper said.
MSP's trends show that traffic stops of Black drivers are not only disproportionately high compared to Michigan's overall Black population, but that their frequency has increased by 3 percentage points over the last three years.
In 2017, about 17% of traffic stops involved a Black driver. That number jumped to about 19% in 2018, then again to just over 20% in 2019.
Only about 14% of Michigan's population is Black.
According to a report from the nonprofit Detroit Justice Center (DJC), low-income and Black drivers are disproportionately subject to traffic fines that can easily become larger, more expensive entanglements in the criminal justice system without the money to pay fines.
The MSP began voluntarily publishing statistics about police use-of-force earlier this summer as part of a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)-led national data collection program. Now, all that information and other related data points will be in one place for the public to access.
""The Michigan State Police Transparency and Accountability website to proactively make department data, policies and information publicly available is another step forward in our continued efforts to strengthen police and community relations and build trust with all Michiganders,"" Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown told the Advance.
Gasper says the MSP will be hiring an independent third-party company to look closer at their data, examining other possible contributing factors, as well. The company will then use that review to identify new strategies that can be implemented to mitigate some of those disparities.
Simultaneously listening to the community through the new advisory board will then help the department put improvements into place, which will hopefully provide a chance for the public — particularly Michiganders who are disproportionately targeted by the police — to feel like the police are on their side, he added.
""We're definitely there to build those relationships and listen to the public. And I think this is a really strong step in that direction,"" Gasper said."

Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Wednesday called on Michigan residents and the state legislature to take action ahead of the Nov. 3 general election. During a news conference, Whitmer and Benson urged voters to request and cast their absentee ballots as soon as possible, while asking state legislators to pass laws to prevent delayed election results and voter disenfranchisement.
""It's crucial that all Michiganders know how to safely exercise their right to vote and make a plan ahead of the November election,"" Whitmer said. ""Right now, Michigan citizens can register to vote and request an absentee ballot online at Michigan.gov/Vote. They also have a number of options to vote safely and securely, including from home, early at their clerk's office, and in person at the polls, and I encourage them to make their voting plan now.""
Whitmer encouraged those who choose to vote from home to avoid possible U.S. Postal Service delays by mailing their ballots back as soon as possible. She said another option is to hand deliver their ballots at their local election clerk's office or drop box.

Starting Sept. 24, local election clerk offices will send absentee ballots to voters and have them available for early in-person voting, Whitmer said. The governor also noted that Michigan residents who are not registered to vote and do not have a state ID or driver's license can still register at their local election clerk's office.
""Already we've had three successful elections this year which saw record turnout, record numbers of citizens voting by mail, and little to no crowding on Election Day,"" Benson added. ""We are on track to replicate this success in November. Our clerks are doing their part, working tirelessly as they have all year to juggle unprecedented challenges while embracing record turnout. But they and voters need support from the federal government and our state legislature.""
Benson said that while other states provide 10 days for pre-processing of absentee ballots, Senate Bill 757, passed yesterday by the Michigan Senate would allow only a few more hours, and only limited pre-processing, which she said is not enough to make a significant difference.
Concerns regarding ballots isn't new in Michigan. Recent issues have done little to alleviate concerns. Benson said Tuesday that about 400 ballots were downloaded by local election clerks with candidates for Vice President listed incorrectly.
The mistake was the result of an isolated human error and would not happen again, according to the Michigan Secretary of State Office; however, the number of innaccurate ballots sent to voters remains unknown. Clerks have been instructed to immediately alert voters of the error and send a corrected ballot. Voters who use the incorrect ballots instead of corrected ballots will still have their vote counted.
Benson also pointed out that thousands of voters were disenfranchised in the August primary because their ballots arrived late or without a signature matching the one on their voter registration. The legislature has not advanced the bills that have been introduced to prevent such disenfranchisement in November.
Community leaders joined Whitmer and Benson to express their confidence in Michigan's elections and to call on all to support them. One of them, NAACP Detroit Chapter President, Rev. Dr. Wendell Anthony, said people should vote as if their life depends on it.
""Every citizen of the state must know that the upcoming election will be safe, secure and solidified on the rolls for voter accreditation,"" he said. ""Every vote must count. We will not be tricked, bamboozled, or have our eyes taken off the prize of voter participation. We have come too far to turn back now. We urge everyone to take your soles to the polls."""

The cases in Saginaw and Washtenaw counties allege excessive use of force by law enforcement while the case in Jackson County focuses on a complaint of professional misconduct by a police officer.
""We recognize that cases of excessive force are always sensitive and of great concern to the public – but that is particularly so because of the terrible tragedies involving aggressive acts by law enforcement across the country this summer,"" Nessel said.
Nessel's office reviewed the cases after being requested by county prosecutors to avoid potential conflicts by local officials.
After reviewing video of the incident and other evidence, Nessel's office said it is charging former Saginaw Police Officer Adam Collier with one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, and two counts of assault and battery, a 93-day misdemeanor.
The charges stem from a July 11 incident in which Collier, who is white, assaulted a Black female detainee twice while she was in his custody, according to the AG's office.
The incident began with a report that the detainee was assaulting another individual at a Saginaw residence, the AG's office said. Collier responded to the scene and took the woman into custody, the AG's office said.
The first assault occurred when Collier forcefully pushed the woman into the backseat of his patrol car, the AG's office said. As she resisted, he struck the woman on the face with a closed fist while she was handcuffed, the AG's office said. The second assault occurred in the sally port of the Saginaw County Jail, the AG's office said. As the woman was exiting the patrol car, she spit at Collier, who then retaliated by striking the handcuffed woman with a closed fist three times in the face and head, the AG's office said.
Collier was terminated from his position with the Saginaw Police Department on July 17, the AG's office said.
Criminal charges have been filed by the Saginaw County prosecutor against the detainee for her conduct during this incident, the AG's office said.
Collier was arraigned remotely Tuesday in 70th District Court in Saginaw County before Judge David Hoffman. He was given a $7,500 personal recognizance bail.
Austin Pearson, a white deputy with the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office, was one of the police officers who responded to a shooting in an Ypsilanti neighborhood on May 26, according to Nessel's office.
Police established a secure perimeter and attempted to locate the shooter, the AG's office said. Shatina Grady and her husband, Daniel Grady, who are both Black, began to interfere with the police activity and refused multiple directives to stop their attempts to compromise the established perimeter, the AG's office said.
Pearson began to arrest the Gradys for noncompliance, and the couple physically resisted, the AG's office said. During the struggle to arrest, Shatina Grady severely bit Pearson on the arm, the AG's office said. Pearson then struck Shatina Grady three times with a closed fist in the head until she released her jaw, the AG's office said. She bit Pearson's other forearm and scratched his head with her fingernails, kicking at other officers as she was escorted to the patrol car, the AG's office said. While in the vehicle, Shatina Grady forcefully kicked the door of the car repeatedly, causing damage to the door and the door frame, the AG's office said.
Following the review of video footage of the incident and other evidence, Nessel's office said it determined Pearson's use of force was justified and appropriate given the suspect's level of resistance, and that he committed no criminal offense in his interactions with Shatina Grady.
However, the AG's office said, Shatina Grady was charged with:
Daniel Grady was also charged with two counts of resisting and obstructing an officer, a two-year felony, the AG's office said.
Arraignment for Shatina and Daniel Grady is pending in Washtenaw County.
Blackman-Leoni Township Public Safety Officer David Lubahn faces felony charges for perjury in a document and misconduct in office for his actions related to an investigation of shots fired near a hotel in Blackman Township on Oct. 23, 2019, according to Nessel.
The investigation revealed that after locating the suspects, officers discovered a gun safe and the key to open it in a hotel room, the AG's office said. Lubahn used the key to open the safe, without legal authorization, and located a gun, the AG's office said. After searching the safe without a warrant, Lubahn re-locked the safe and presented a court with a search warrant affidavit containing false and misleading information, the AG's office said.
Lubahn is charged with one count of perjury of a record or document, a 15-year felony, and one count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, the AG's office said.
Lubahn was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in 12th District Court in Jackson before Judge Daniel Goostrey.
Nessel's office thanked the Michigan State Police for the department's work investigating the Saginaw and Jackson counties cases, and deputies from the Eaton County Sheriff's and Lapeer County Sheriff's offices that made up the Michigan Sheriffs' Association MISSION Team, which investigated the Washtenaw County case.
""Law enforcement officers take an oath of office and we fully expect them to uphold that promise,"" Nessel said. ""Those who betray their oath behave in a manner beneath their position as trusted public servants and undermine the credibility of every upstanding officer who serves."""

The city launched its alley cleaning program in 2020. The pilot program is on pace to clean 500 alleys by the end of the year. So far, 29 alleys have been cleaned, officials said. The city announced Friday that the overwhelmingly positive response from residents has created more opportunity for Detroiters who would like to help beautify neighborhoods through work as a paid member of the cleanup crew.
""The alley cleanup program was a direct response to what we've heard from residents for years,"" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said. ""We've heard the continual requests to get the alleys cleaned up. Not only are we listening; we're acting, but we can't do this work alone. Together with registered block clubs across the city, and any Detroiter that wants to help get the work done, we can get this city cleaned up, one alley at a time.""
Detroit vacated alleys decades ago, meaning alleys have since become the responsibility of the adjacent homeowners. The new program provides residents with city assistance to clean up overgrown alleys in exchange for a commitment from residents for ongoing maintenance and cleanup.
The work performed by city cleanup crews includes complete removal of everything in the alley, including debris removal and tree and brush trimming, the city said. Some light grading work is also being done to ensure alleys are leveled and passable. Gates are expected to be made available next year.
Since the program's inception 549 tons of debris has been cleared and 391 tires along with 523 trees have been removed from city alleys, according to the city.
Paid positions available for city residents
The city is looking to hire at least 20 additional Detroit residents interested in performing alley cleanup duties. There are several positions available, with pay ranging from $13 to $20 per hour.

Partnerships with Registered Block Clubs
A major component of the alley cleanup program is its partnership with registered block clubs and neighborhood associations. The city said it will only select alleys submitted by those groups registered with the Department of Neighborhoods.
Once an alley has been selected and cleaned, the block club must commit to maintaining the alley by performing additional cleanups, at least twice per year."

Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens made the ruling Friday morning in a case against Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson brought forth by the Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans.
The ruling is the second ruling made this week that extends the ballot receipt deadline in a key swing state. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Thursday extended the deadline to the Friday following the election, so long as the ballots are postmarked by Nov. 2.
The ruling only applies to the November 2020 and will not continue to future elections, according to the order.

A second part of Stephens' Friday ruling maintains that a voter can have assistance from anyone in returning their ballots between the Friday before election day and Nov. 3.

""The Democrat Trump Hater Secretary of State of Michigan, purposely misprinted Ballots for the Military, putting the wrong names on the Ballot,"" Trump posted on Twitter.
""This was not a mistake, it was done illegally and on purpose.""
Trump's tweet is in reference to a recent issue in which the Michigan Secretary of State's Office said about 400 ballots were downloaded by local election clerks with candidates for Vice President listed incorrectly. The ballots were for registered voters who live abroad or serve in the military.
The Secretary of State office said the issue was the result of an isolated human error and that it would not happen again. Benson was quick to respond to the president's attack on Twitter.
""Once again you're wrong,"" Benson tweeted. ""This was an unintended computer glitch that was caught & quickly corrected. Suggesting otherwise is false & misleading. Impacted voters immediately received an accurate ballot & guidance to ensure their vote counts. And my name, again, is @JocelynBenson.""
Benson's office said it was unclear how many of those ballots were sent to voters, but clerks were instructed to immediately alert voters of the error and send a corrected ballot.
Voters who use the incorrect ballots instead of corrected ballots will still have their vote counted.
Benson and Trump have had a frequent back-and-forth of criticism. In May, Trump threatened to cut coronavirus pandemic funding to Michigan after Benson announced a plan to send applications for absentee ballots to all Michiganders who are registered to vote.

For the first time in 10 years, the city is no longer considered the poorest city in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey results released Thursday.
The survey data released Thursday uses information from 2019. Detroit was listed as the No. 2 most impoverished big city in the U.S. last year, with 30.6 percent of its residents living below the poverty line. Cleveland was No. 1 with 30.8 percent of its residents living below the poverty line.

The expansion includes the installation of 4,500 humps in 2021 after 1,200 were installed this year. The pilot began in 2018, with just 32 speed humps, and has grown annually, Duggan said. The devices will be installed in prioritized areas where they can have the most impact on neighborhood safety, Duggan said.
""Probably the single biggest neighborhood concern we have been hearing from residents this year is speeding and reckless driving along residential side streets, so it's not surprising that the speed hump program has become so wildly popular,"" Duggan said. ""We know this is a priority for residents, so we are making the expansion of this effort one of our highest priorities for the next year.""
The speed humps are one part of the city's traffic calming efforts to increase overall neighborhood safety and slow down motorists in those areas with high pedestrian traffic. In 2020, streets adjacent to city parks and schools were given priority, the city said in a news release.
For the 2021 program, the city has allocated $11.5 million that will come from state transportation funds, as well planned capital projects that have been reprioritized, Duggan said.
Duggan said the city is looking to partner with Detroit-based, minority-owned asphalt companies to help install the speed humps.
The 4,500 locations for speed humps will be on streets with a 25 mph speed limit, according to the city. Installation will start next spring on sites determined by the road engineering department based traffic count, the number of children living on the street and reports of speeding.

Gretchen Whitmer Wednesday create the MI Healthy Climate Plan, which aims to protect the environment and help develop new clean energy jobs by putting Michigan on a path toward becoming fully carbon-neutral by 2050, the state announced in a news release.
""The science is clear – climate change is directly impacting our public health, environment, our economy, and our families,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""This dangerous reality is already causing harm throughout Michigan, with communities of color and low-income Michiganders suffering disproportionately, which is why I'm taking immediate action to protect our state. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to leave them a cleaner, safer and healthier world.
""Through comprehensive and aggressive steps, we will combat the climate crisis by formally setting and relentlessly pursuing a goal of statewide decarbonization by 2050. These bold actions will provide critical protections for our environment, economy, and public health, now and for years to come. It will also position Michigan to attract a new generation of clean energy and energy efficiency jobs.""
Executive Directive 2020-10 sets the goal of economic decarbonization in Michigan by 2050. Officials said transitioning to carbon neutrality will mitigate the future harms of climate change and enable Michigan to take full advantage of the ongoing global energy transformation — from the jobs it will generate for our skilled workforce, to the protections it will provide for natural resources, to the savings it will bring to communities and utility customers.
To ensure steady progress in its goal, the executive directive puts forth that Michigan will aim to achieve a 28 percent reduction below 1990 levels in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, according to a news release.
""Michiganders have been on the front lines of environmental protection from the first Earth Day 50 years ago, and we continue to lead with these important steps to safeguard Michiganders and their natural resources,"" EGLE Director Liesl Clark said in a statement. ""We see forward motion with the establishment of the Michigan Advisory Council on Environmental Justice and the recent announcement of training and technical assistance to help communities address climate impacts.
""We're excited to amplify and elevate the work of so many Michigan cities and towns taking vital steps to protect their residents and resources, while sharing in the benefits brought by clean energy industries.""

Early voting in Michigan begins Thursday, which is when clerks at local municipalities will begin sending out absentee ballots to voters who have already requested them.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, voting early has become an increasingly popular method. More than 2.3 million absentee ballot requests have been submitted as of Monday — a state record, according to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.
The previous record was the August primary, during which roughly 2 million absentee ballots were requested. Nearly 1.6 million people ended up voting absentee in August, according to Benson's office.
Michiganders looking to vote absentee have a few options: they can cast their vote by mail, a drop box or by voting absentee in-person. Voting in person on Election Day is also still an option.
Looking to be one of the millions of Michiganders to vote early? Here are some things to know.
In-person or via mail, if you're not registered to vote you may run into some issues. It is probable a good idea to make sure you're registered well ahead of Nov. 3. You can do so by visiting Michigan's Secretary of State website here.
If you want an absentee ballot mailed to you, you still have time to apply for one online here. The deadline is 5 p.m. Oct. 30. You can also download an application for an absentee ballot and return it to your clerk.
Once you've applied for, receives and filled out your respective ballot, you'll need to return it to your clerk to ensure your vote is counted.
Benson's office said voters can return ballots by mail, a drop box or by voting absentee in-person. In Michigan, it is recommended to return your ballot by Oct. 20 if you're voting by mail.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can keep track of your ballot by contacting your city or township clerk's office."

The Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945 allows governors to issue state of emergencies during a crisis and has been used frequently amid the coronavirus pandemic by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
In a news release, Unlock Michigan, a group of Michigan residents who oppose Whitmer's emergency declarations, said it would turn the petition in to the bureau of elections ""soon.""
""We've succeeded in collecting more than a half-million signatures from Michigan voters in fewer than 80 days, an historic accomplishment at a pivotal point in Michigan's history,"" Unlock Michigan Co-Chair Ron Armstrong said in a statement. ""This initiative isn't about any one rule, or any one personality. This proposed law simply takes away the ability of a single politician to rule like a monarch for as long as they like. That's a power that no politician of any party should ever have.""

However, questions persist regarding how the group was able to raise the 500,000 signatures. According to a report published Tuesday by Paul Egan of The Detroit Free Press, the group paid people to give false information, illegally collect signatures and trespassed on private property.
The report cited a secretly recorded video tape.
According to the report, the group paid people $3.50 per signature while telling them ""they can"" do illegal things to acquire signatures.
""This can be a real shady job,"" Erik Tisinger, a trainer for the California signature company In the Field, Inc., told the trainees in the video, according to the Free Press. ""And when I say shady, I mean, people do all sorts of illegal s--- all the time and never get caught. It's really hard to get caught doing s--- except for, like, forgeries.""
A spokesman for Unlock Michigan told the Free Press that In the Field, which hired Tisinger, will not get paid for the signatures it collected due to the contents of the video.
The petition was formed due to issues some residents have with Whitmer's use of emergency orders during the pandemic. She has extended the emergency declaration continuously, with the current order set to expire Oct. 1."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Lack of jobs. Government won't solve our problems. But working people can do it by organizing. We should take money back from the profits of the big corporations, money they make by keeping our wages low and making fewer people do more work. Take money back from the tax breaks big corporations get. Use it to fix things that need fixing. That would create jobs.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I have confidence in my class, the working class, not in government, not in Democrats or Republicans who promise every election that they will do things for us.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I grew up in the Jim Crow South, survived by learning to fight back. I lived in LA under racist cops, survived that by standing up for myself. I've lived in Detroit for 43 years, and survived that by learning to stand together with other workers to solve our problems.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
The problem isn't coronavirus. It's big business and the two big parties that take from our taxes to give more money to the biggest thieves in the country.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
It's not possible to reform a system that needs police. I believe Black people can defend ourselves, when we bring ourselves together to fight back. I believe all working people can figure out how to do that.

Health care -- it was not set up to serve the majority, the working people. It is set up to make money for big drug companies, hospitals, nursing homes. The basic principle of health care should be that no one makes a profit off of it, and there is no cost to anyone who needs it. Medical care can mean your life. No price should be put on our lives.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
Most of us have to work. I believe we are all part of the same class, blacks, immigrants, earlier immigrants who are now called ""white"". Everyone here, except Indians, came from other countries, slaves or ""free."" We have all been abused by the ones who brought us here, slave owners before, factory owners today. The people who brought us here try to create divisions, try to get us fighting each other. They exploit all of us. They are our enemy."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Lockdowns and government abuse of power--I intend to replace the current representative who is supportive of government home arrests, business lockdowns, forcing people to wear masks, and other forms of governemnt overreach and abuse of power. People are tired of being treated like children by their pubic servants and are capable of making informed choices and to take personal responsibility. I am helping with the effort to repeal the governors abuse of emergency powers and for her removal from office for implimenting policies leading to the needless death of nursing home residents. Following these actions we need to lift any other government road blocks perventing people from earning a living to feed their families and pay their bills. Government hand out checks only leads us to deeper debt which will worsen our economy and kill the job market which will further hurt the working class.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I understand the government's proper role is to secure our God-given rights and my role to defend individual liberty through an equal application of the law while restraing government within its enumerated privileges outlined in our Constitution---conversly, my opponent has abused government through policies which pander to specific social groups we each belong to at the expense of others. Her approach seeks more control over people, resources, the economy and our level of prosperity, this coupled with her divisive messaging only creates more animocity amongst the people which leads to hatred and violence--as we are seeing being played out in our nations streets. Liberty provides a much more sustainable and inclusive pathway towards peace and prosperity than socialism ever could hope to.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have led Michigan Campaign for Liberty as a legislative activist since 2009--learning and putting into practice the legislative process with a deep understanding of the rule of law and the principles which our nation was founded upon. I know how the corporate lobby works and how to put them in check. I am familar with the DC mechanism and will not by bullied by them.
In the past I have worked with people of different views in order to prevent freedom shredding legislation from being implemented such as the attempt by the state legislature to enact ""red light cameras"" in our urban areas which violates due process in communites where people cannot afford to take time out of work for court hearings over traffic ticket from a camera. We found that municipalties could adjust the timing devices of traffic lights to trap people into tickets. We worked hard to help enact wroker friendly labor laws through union choice.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
The ""state"" is responsible for the lockdowns and home arrests, Governor Whitmer is soley responsible for issuing over 160 executive orders, not the virus---""state government"" can help by removing the road blocks they implemented and get out of the way to allow people to make decisions for themselves. There is no easy answer to recovery from an artificial destruction of businesses. Less intrusive governemnt and more freedom is the answer.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
Justice is justice, when you add a word in front of justice you detract from its purest meaning. By this I mean whlle there are sytemic injustices, racial tentions are perpetuated by people in government who set the polcies which others can abuse. For the dominate portion of America so-called ""racial injustice""
is nonexistent--it's buzz concept to enrage minorities and those who push this propaganda for political power neither beleive in the idea nor do they actually care about people it effects, their mission is political power and they use minorties as pawns in their endeavors.
Police reforms are required, even the best police departments are aware of this. We need to invest in our police such as mental and emotional support--our officers see things the average person does not and nor could the average person handle. We need less intrusive laws which frees up officers to focus on violent crimes, the drug laws must be revised and in some cased illiminated--this single act would reduce needless interactions leading to needless injury and death.
In 2019 a total of 9 unarmed black persons were killed by police.
Calls for ""defunding' are rooted in lunacy and a lack of understanding, and coupled with disarming law-abiding people leaves men and single mothers defenseless from violent criminals. Finally, ours citizens want nothing to do wiht allowing criminals to run our streets, they want law and order, and a good relationship between themselves and their neighborhood patrol officers.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
Finding answers to the problems government created requires less government and more freedom. The people want the securing of a long-term career that they build, not a job government handed them with no future. People want health care system which seeks results, not enrollment and endless testing, and they need more knowledge of trational medicine and prevention. People want easier pathways to careers such as implementing Independant Share Agreements for college and skills trade rather than allowing schools and banks to profit off of enrollment with no results upon graduation. I seek to end the inflation tax which is hidden but occurs when government creates money from nothing, artifically injecting it into our economy which robs from laborers and punishes those who try to save---this is the cancer in our society and the banks are profiiting from the people's hardship. Finally, people want safe streets, clean water, and a government that is restrained, not one filled with ambitious members of the political class who talk a good game every 2 or 4 years, deliver on nothing and are only intersted in making a name for themselves.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I do not pretend to have all the answers, but controlling people is not what government should be doing no matter what the cause--my opponent seeks greater control over people through a historically failed philosophy of socialism, I seek only the freedom of people through the unifying message of individual liberty and equal justice for all."

The day is ""a nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy,"" according to the National Voter Registration Day campaign.
The effort to register as many people to vote as possible has increased during the 2020 election season, which includes a presidential campaign amid the global coronavirus pandemic.
""Voter registration is more important than ever this year,"" the organization said in a statement. ""This year, we'll also use the holiday to raise public awareness not only of voter registration options, but also alternative means of voting across the country.""
Here are five things to know about Voter Registration Day, and how you can take part.
1. Has 'National Voter Registration Day' worked? Nearly 3 million voter registrations have been made on the day since it began, the campaign said. More than 300,000 Americans registered to vote on the inaugural day, Sept. 25, 2012, and the number has been gradually increasing ahead of election days ever since, with around 800,000 new registrations recorded on the day in 2018, according to date from the National Day Calendar. In 2019, there were 473,725 voter registrations on National Voter Registration Day, a number the organization said is more than three times the previous record during a year without a federal election.
2. Foot Locker Rocks The Vote This Year: The national athletic gear chain is partnering with the progressive ""Rock the Vote"" campaign to offer voter registration help at 200 of its stores beginning this week in alignment with National Voter Registration Day. Foot Locker says it's leveraging its brand's relationship with the 18-24 year-olds of Generation Z. The company said it will have a ""one-click"" access to a digital hub where customers can check their voter registration status, register to vote and sign-up for election reminders.
3. Voter Registration Events Near Me: The National Voter Registration Day has a directory of planned events, both in-person and virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, on its website. In Michigan, events are planned in Detroit and Hancock.
4. How To Vote-By-Mail In Michigan: More than 80 percent of American voters will have the opportunity to vote-by-mail in the upcoming Nov. 3 election, by far the most in U.S. history. Absentee voting is allowed for all in 34 states, and only six states require an ""excuse"" other than fear of the coronavirus to vote-by-mail. See how to vote by mail in Michigan here.
5. Know What's On Your Ballot: All eyes will no doubt be on the presidential election, with Republican President Donald Trump seeking re-election against Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden. But the Nov. 3 election will also feature political races at the state, county and local level in some places. Vote411.org, in addition to offering help with registering to vote, has information on what's on your ballot."

""COVID-19 testing to identify positive cases so that state and local health officials can take quick action to limit outbreaks is an important strategy,"" Gordon said. ""Testing – along with wearing masks, social distancing and frequent handwashing – is especially important in settings such as our juvenile justice facilities where youth and staff come in contact with others.""
Testing is required for staff at Bay Pines Center in Escanaba and Shawono Center in Grayling – the two state-operated facilities that support juvenile offenders. Subject to availability of testing supplies, the facilities are required to:
The emergency order also requires the juvenile justice facilities to take all necessary precautions to prevent transmission of COVID-19 – which may include requiring any staff suspected of exposure to COVID-19 to be tested outside the facility – and exclude from work staff with COVID-19 until they have met return-to-work criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The order provides the same testing requirement as the order signed for prisons, veterans' homes and state-operated psychiatric facilities.
Under a recently signed letter of understanding, union-represented employees of the juvenile justice centers will be provided 80 hours of additional sick leave that can be used after other leave credits have been exhausted due to a positive test or after close contact quarantine. This also was offered to correction officers, health care workers and staff at state-operated psychiatric facilities and centers."

Trump said he expect to make the announcement Friday or Saturday, following services honoring the life of Ginsburg.

By Allison Donahue - September 18, 2020
Michigan Court of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens ruled Friday that Michigan clerks must accept any late ballots that were postmarked no later than the day before the election, Nov. 2, and received 14 days after the election.
Stephens said there was ""affidavit evidence that many voters were in fact deprived of having their absent voter ballot tallied in the August primary.""
More than 6,400 valid ballots received after the Aug. 4 primary were rejected.
""Affidavits and testimony detailed that despite voters requesting absent ballots weeks in advance of the primary, their actual ballot arrived as late as Election Day,"" Stephens wrote.
The preliminary injunction only applies to the Nov. 3 general election.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is the named defendant, has been pushing for legislation that would allow clerks to count late ballots that were postmarked before Election Day.
""No eligible voter should be disenfranchised through no fault of their own for exercising their right to vote by mail,"" Benson said. ""The court's decision recognizes many of the unique challenges that the pandemic has created for all citizens and will reduce the potential for voter disenfranchisement due to mail delays.""
Stephens also granted a request for preliminary injunction that wouldn't limit absentee voters to who is allowed to assist them in completing their ballot when help from the clerk's office may be unavailable, which is prohibited under Michigan law.
Michigan law only allows a mail-handler, clerk, assistant to the clerk, a person living in the household or a member of the immediate family to help fill out a ballot.
Stephens said this restriction ""risks leaving too many voters without the opportunity of receiving assistance in returning their ballots.""
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Davis, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to block a state law and lift restrictions on paying to transport people to polling places.
The lawsuit was filed by Priorities USA, a Washington, D.C.-based Democratic SuperPAC, in November 2019.
""Congress implemented a statutory scheme and gave citizens the right to spend money on transporting voters to the polls. The November election is nearly upon us and any particular election only occurs once,"" Davis wrote."

The MI Clean Water Plan makes a significant investment after decades of underinvestment in Michigan's infrastructure, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said. Whitmer said making sure Michigan residents have access to affordable and clean water was a priority for her administration since taking office.
""The MI Clean Water Plan marks a significant step toward that goal,"" she said. ""The MI Clean Water investment will help us rebuild Michigan's water infrastructure and will prioritize and invest directly into protecting our public health, environment, and economy. The MI Clean Water Plan is a critical part of the solution, but the work cannot stop here. I look forward to working with the legislature to find creative solutions to address our water infrastructure backlog. Everyone must remain committed to ensuring that every Michigander has access to clean water.""
The MI Clean Water investment is a unified approach to cleaner, more affordable water, officials said. The plan provides direct investments for communities, helps provide safe, clean water to residents and will support over 7,500 Michigan jobs, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
""Access to clean drinking water is a cornerstone of our work at EGLE, and this exciting package of water protections pulls together a wealth of resources to help ensure clean water for all Michiganders,"" EGLE Director Liesl Clark said. ""Now is the perfect time to invest state and federal dollars in a coordinated way to encourage job growth in water infrastructure jobs. This work will ripple throughout both the economy and the systems that protect public health, strengthening both.""
Officials said MI Clean Water confronts the large infrastructure issues that Michigan faces, such as lead-laden water service lines, toxic contamination like PFAS, undersized sewers, failing septic systems, unaffordable water rates, and constrained local budgets. MI Clean Water will reduce barriers for communities and allow them to access needed funds for necessary and timely infrastructure upgrades.
This investment — described by Whitmer as historic — includes a proposal combining federal dollars for lead service line replacement in low-income communities ($102.1 million) with bonding authority for water quality protection ($290 million), one-time General Fund appropriation for drinking water infrastructure and innovation ($105 million), and asset management grants ($2.9 million) to help communities develop, update, and improve their plans for wastewater and stormwater systems resulting in a comprehensive water infrastructure investment of $500 million in Michigan's water systems.
The MI Clean Water investment will be done without raising the taxes of Michiganders, officials said. The plan includes:
A $207.1 million investment in drinking water quality, including:
A $293 million investment in wastewater protection, including:
""It's time for the legislature to take bold actions to invest in Michigan's infrastructure and protect our water from toxic contamination,"" Whitmer said. ""I'm calling on the legislature to authorize EGLE to use the remainder of the voter-approved 2002 Great Lakes Water Quality bond during this legislative session. Michiganders are tired of waiting for action, the time is now. We must all work together to improve the quality of the waters of our State.""
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said he supports Whitmer's plan and said he appreciates the aggressive nature of the plan.
""In Detroit, where we have the oldest infrastructure in the state, it would give us the ability to greatly expand our water main replacement program and replace an additional 2,000 lead service lines beyond our current program,"" Duggan said. ""As we do with all of our capital projects, we will hire Detroiters to do this work. We also plan to dedicate a portion of these funds to expand our affordability programs to help our most impoverished residents, who cannot take advantage of our other assistance programs.""
Kevin Hertel, D-St. Clair Shores, said Michigan's infrastructure has been systematically disinvested for years, adding that his constituents have been among those experiencing the results.
""Sewage overflows in Southeast Michigan impacting Lake St. Clair, PFAS and dioxane found in multiple drinking water sources, and, of course, the lasting impact of the Flint Water Crisis are just some of the impacts we're already facing, and we need to act now to prevent further harm,"" he said. ""This plan will allow us to address these issues while creating thousands of good-paying jobs. I am excited to put Michiganders to work to clean up our state."""

Gretchen Whitmer has signed her second budget into law, ensuring that Michigan has its spending plan in place prior to the start of the new fiscal year on Oct 1.
The governor said the budget delivers on many of her signature priorities, including the Michigan Reconnect program for a tuition-free pathway for adults, funding for the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies program to ensure women have the care they need for a healthy pregnancy and expanding access to childcare for families.
""While this budget faced many challenges along the way amidst a global pandemic, I am pleased that we were able to come together and produce a budget that funds the programs and services that matter most to our residents ,"" Whitmer said. ""This has not been easy, but in the end the executive and legislative branches of government worked together to do what is expected and demanded of us and we now have a budget that will serve Michigan well.""
The budget does not include any state funding reductions for schools, colleges, universities and local governments below their original 2020 funding levels. The budget includes new education investments focused on providing students, teachers and adults across Michigan with needed resources, according to Whitmer. Those resources include:
""For Michigan to succeed in the global race for talent, we need effective tools that help our citizens get the skills the 21st century economy demands,"" said Sandy K. Baruah, president and CEO of the Detroit Regional Chamber. ""I could not be more pleased that Governor Whitmer and the Legislature have prioritized the Michigan Reconnect program in this difficult budget year. It is a proven model to help adults in the workforce achieve their next level of skill development and professional success that also strengthens the talent pipeline for employers.""
Whitmer said a focus of the budget was to prioritize the health of families across Michigan. Resources included in the budget include:
""We are incredibly grateful to Governor Whitmer and the Legislature for making investments in strategies proven to reduce racial disparities in infant and maternal outcomes,"" said Dr. Renay Gagleard, Board Chair for the Michigan Council for Maternal and Child Health. ""Extending coverage in the postpartum period will undoubtedly save lives. One in three pregnancy-related deaths occur in the postpartum period, and it's a critical time for providers to identify mothers who may need help with postpartum depression or to continue treatment for a substance use disorder. This continuity of care will help ensure more babies aren't left to start their lives without their mother.""
A total of $4.2 million is provided to begin implementing the pre-trial incarceration task force recommendation for crisis intervention and de-escalation training through the Michigan Coalition on Law Enforcement Standards. The budget includes $7 million to increase the number of troopers within the Michigan State Police.
The budget also includes $14.3 million in broadband funding to help expand internet access across the state which is more important than ever to Michiganders relying on telework, telehealth, and virtual learning."

Where Michigan was once among the states most heavily hit by COVID-19, its per-capita rate of new daily cases has plateaued at a level well below the national average, Whitmer's office said. Despite gradually reopening the state's economy, Michigan's seven-day case positivity rate has remained between 3 percent and 3.7 percent since early July. Over the same time period, case growth has also remained within a narrow band of 61 to 71 daily new cases per million population, by date of symptom onset, according to a news release.
More than 123,000 cases of the coronavirus have been reported in Michigan as of Tuesday, according to the state. Over 6,700 people have died from the coronavirus in Michigan.

The health, economic, and social harms of the COVID-19 pandemic remain widespread and severe, and they continue to constitute a statewide emergency and disaster, Whitmer said.
Though local health departments have some limited capacity to respond to cases as they arise within their jurisdictions, Whitmer said state emergency operations are necessary to bring this pandemic under control in Michigan and to build and maintain infrastructure to stop the spread of COVID-19, trace infections, and to quickly direct additional resources to hot-spots as they emerge.
The emergency declaration is different than the stay-home order, which was lifted in June.

Producing photo identification has been required since 1996, when state law determined it necessary.
The following documents are acceptable forms of identification:
It is worth noting that the identification presented does not need your address on it. Also, the listed name can be a shorter variation of your official name. For example, Joseph could be Joey.
So you traveled to your polling location but forgot a photo ID? No worries. In Michigan, there is another way.
If you do not have photo ID, you can cast a ballot by signing an affidavit, according to the Michigan SOS. The affidavit can be used by voters who do not have acceptable photo ID and voters who have photo ID but didn't bring it to the polls.
Once the affidavit has been signed, the voter can cast their ballot. It will be counted with all other ballots on Election Day.

Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday.
There are now 800,794 people enrolled in the Healthy Michigan Plan, the state's expanded Medicaid program.
""As Senate Democratic Leader, I was proud to work across the aisle with a Republican governor and legislature to expand health coverage for Michiganders through the Healthy Michigan plan,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""Now, with the Affordable Care Act under constant attack in the courts, it's more important than ever that we protect Healthy Michigan and ensure care for families across the state. Repealing the law would put Michiganders' lives at risk and hurt our economy. I will continue working with everyone who wants to protect and expand health care for Michiganders.""
COVID-19 affected the finances and health of so many Michiganders that the number of Healthy Michigan Plan beneficiaries jumped from just under 682,000 in late March to more than 800,000 six months later, the state said in a news release.
Michigan instituted policies to help families access affordable health care coverage such as deciding to avoid terminating Healthy Michigan Plan coverage and freeze premiums for as long as the COVID-19 public health emergency exists. The state was able to qualify for additional Medicaid funding from the federal government through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
The department has also worked to streamline the application process over the past few years to ensure people eligible to receive benefits are able to access them without unnecessary burdensome requirements.
""Expanding access to health care coverage is one of MDHHS's top priorities,"" MDHHS Director Robert Gordon said. ""The Healthy Michigan Plan has been a huge success by improving health outcomes for thousands of Michiganders. Our residents are healthier and our state is more productive when people have health insurance.""
Healthy Michigan Plan coverage is available to Michiganders ages 19-64 years old who have an income at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level – or $16,971 annually for a single person – and meet other eligibility requirements, such as not qualifying for other Medicaid programs. Expanded Medicaid plans are allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act if states decide to implement them.
According to 2017 research from the University of Michigan, the Healthy Michigan Plan more than doubled primary care usage, reduced enrollees' reliance on the emergency room by 58 percent, cut uncompensated care by nearly 50 percent, and added $2.3 billion to our state's economy."

The AG's office said Monday it received complaints from residents who report they were deceived by petition circulators who were gathering signatures to support the efforts of Unlock Michigan, which is trying to repeal the 1945 Emergency Powers of the Governor Act. Residents said they were told the petitions were to support LGBTQ rights, for medical marijuana initiatives or to help small businesses, among other things, according to Nessel's office.
""Our democracy is firmly rooted in the principles of an informed electorate which makes decisions at the polls based on reason and beliefs over lies and deception,"" Nessel said. ""Our ballot initiative process allows efforts with strong public support to be presented to the Legislature. But that process becomes tainted when petition circulators manipulate and cheat to serve their own agendas. My office will investigate these allegations, and if there is a violation of law, we will prosecute those responsible.""

The Emergency Powers of Governor Act of 1945 allows governors to issue state of emergencies during a crisis and has been used frequently amid the coronavirus pandemic by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Unlock Michigan, which calls itself a group of Michigan residents who oppose Whitmer's emergency declarations, said in a news release last week that it had reached 500,000 signatures and said it would turn the petition in to the bureau of elections ""soon.""
The Michigan AG's office has also received a letter from the League of Women Voters and another from election law attorney John Pirich calling for an investigation into Unlock Michigan's signature-collecting efforts.
Any potential charges that may be filed against Unlock Michigan and its members will depend on whether criminal activity took place and the evidence compiled by the AG's office in its investigation, Nessel said.

126,/michigan/detroit/black-voters-detroit-key-biden-are-they-engaged,2020-09-28T01:17:40Z,"Black Voters In Detroit Key For Biden, But Are...",0,12,Associated Press,News Partner,"DETROIT (AP) — Wendy Caldwell-Liddell is tired of waiting for change in Detroit.
The nation's largest Black-majority city has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and its ensuing economic fallout. More than 14,200 COVID-19 cases and 1,500 deaths have been confirmed in the city.
So when the 29-year-old Black mother of two thinks about what's at stake in the November presidential election, her answer is simple: Everything. She's determined to help defeat President Donald Trump.
""Trump won Michigan by less than 11,000 votes,"" noted Caldwell-Liddell, the co-founder of Mobilize Detroit, a newly formed grassroots organization. ""And so, our thought process is, if we can just get an additional 15,000 or 20,000 to show up, that could change Michigan's trajectory for the presidential election.""
Black voters across Michigan will be pivotal in deciding who will win the battleground state in November. But engaging them at a time of immense uncertainty across the nation because of the pandemic and unrest over the effects of systemic racism has been especially challenging.
""A lot of Black folks are having that experience of getting punched in the gut several times in 2020,"" said Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, the first African American in that post. ""But I also know that Black folks, Black women in particular, are going to take care of business … Donald Trump is such an existential threat to Black life and Black futures and I think we're going to show up and make sure that he's no longer president.""
Both Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are battling for support among Black voters across the state. Biden visited Detroit earlier this month, and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was spending time in Flint and Detroit on Tuesday.
Trump's campaign has opened an office on Detroit's west side in the heart of a neighborhood where local residents say they've never seen a Republican presence before. Trump campaign officials said volunteers have been knocking on doors and doing other field activities across the state.
""Throughout this campaign, Joe Biden has attempted to paint President Trump as someone he's not in a veiled attempt to hide his own abysmal racist record on Black America,"" Trump deputy national press secretary Ken Farnaso said in a statement. ""With President Trump in the Oval Office, Black Americans can rest assure that they have a true fighter and advocate working on their behalf.""
But in a city that has always been a Democratic stronghold, Trump's presence is troubling to local officials who say they want to see Biden's campaign have a stronger visibility.
""We don't have any type of engagement in Detroit, and it's just mind-boggling,"" said Nicole Small, a Detroit Charter Commission member. ""And now you have, especially young Black voters and people living in poverty, saying, well, what difference is it going to make if we vote for Biden or if we vote for Trump? They're being dismissed and overlooked by the Democratic Party.""
Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she's getting volunteers and staffers ready to knock on doors in the 13th Congressional District, which is largely African American.
""I tell them this is not just about names on the ballot,"" Tlaib said. ""This is about the issues that matter to us. It's about getting closer to ending the broken systems that have been so oppressive and painful for so many of our communities of color.""
Biden's campaign and state Democratic Party officials have said they're reaching voters through virtual events and making ""millions of calls and texts"" to voters across Michigan. They've also invested heavily in television, radio and digital ads across the state and are fulfilling orders for several thousands of campaign signs.
The campaign said it has a field team with a strong African American outreach program and a voter protection team focused on engaging communities of color.
In an interview this month with longtime Detroit radio host Mildred Gaddis, Biden noted that Michigan, and its Black voters in Detroit, are ""critically important.""
""When I was the vice president, I was the guy put in charge of reviving Detroit, remember?"" Biden said. "" I'm going to be coming back, God willing, in order to be able to make the case why what the president has done to the African American community has been devastating, and what I've done my whole career has been uplifting.""
In Wayne County, which is 39% Black and includes Detroit, Hillary Clinton won 66% of the vote in 2016, a noticeable drop from the 80% President Barack Obama won in 2012. About 37,000 fewer people turned out to vote in 2016 than in 2012.
Democratic state leaders said they learned hard lessons and that the party has worked to connect with Black voters.
""The excitement is there if you look at the number of folks who participate in our virtual events, the number of folks who want to participate in the in-person events that Dr. Jill Biden and Joe Biden himself did here in Michigan,"" said Michigan Democratic Party chair Lavora Barnes. ""People are very enthusiastic about voting for Biden and Harris and turning this president out in November.""
But deep within Detroit neighborhoods, grassroots activist Ramone Jackson said people are struggling and disengaged from the political process.
""We are in a dire situation as a Black community so we've got to understand our power,"" said Jackson, who has spent months teaching people about the power of voting with a sharp focus on local elections. ""That power, it's our Congress members, not the president. We've got to hold them accountable.""
But challenges remain in connecting with apathetic voters and with younger Black voters who might have more progressive leanings — key demographics that Branden Snyder, the executive director of Detroit Action, said his organization is trying to reach.
""We've got about 48,000 new young people who've been registered since March that we're trying to mobilize,"" said Snyder, the previous deputy organizing director in charge of Youth Voting for the Hillary For Michigan 2016 presidential campaign. ""We're building an army of people that we can engage not just this year in the presidency, but also for 2021 with local elections.""
But Black voters who live in suburban counties, like Oakland County resident Lucell Trammer, a 40-year-old father of two, say it's important for the party to connect with them, too.
""We are in every single demographic, we're in every single voting bloc, we're in every single county,"" Trammer said, noting that Black voters are not a monolith and represent a swath of classes and backgrounds. ""We tend to be the bellwether, especially African American women. I tell people all the time: If you don't listen to any other voting bloc, listen to African American women.""

Support for home health agencies is needed more than ever. The virtual job fair allows home health agencies the opportunity to highlight their organizations' mission and vision, summarize current job opportunities, post a video about their organization and talk with job seekers in a virtual platform.

Absentee voting has become increasingly popular in recent elections, due in part to Michigan residents no longer needing an ""excuse"" to vote absentee. The other big reason, of course, is the presence of COVID-19.
If you're looking to vote absentee, you still have time to register. You can request an application to vote absentee in Michigan as late as 5 p.m. on Oct. 30. The ballot needs to be returned and postmarked by Nov. 2. In Michigan, it is recommended to return your ballot by Oct. 20 if you're voting by mail, according to the Secretary of State office.

Gretchen Whitmer and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday called for a Congressional oversight investigation into what they called the Trump administration's politicization of government functions that have impeded the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic.
The two Democratic governors released joint statements on Thursday announcing their request for the investigation while also criticizing President Donald Trump, saying that is is ""an inarguable fact that the United States has had the worst response to the COVID-19 virus.""
""The unprecedented and unacceptable scale of this tragedy is the direct result of President Trump and the federal government's deceit, political self-dealing, and incompetence,"" the two governors said in a joint statement.

""Rather than turning to the advice and direction of public health experts and career public servants, President Trump instead put the health and security of the American people in the hands of political appointees whose first priority was securing the reelection of their benefactor, with predictably tragic results,"" the statement continues.
Trump's response to the virus has been heavily criticized by Democratic figures. The U.S. currently leads the world with over 7.1 million cases and nearly 207,000 deaths as of Thursday morning, according to data provided by the World Health Organization.
Michigan ranks 17th in the U.S. in reported coronavirus cases. It is ninth in coronavirus deaths. New York is fourth in COVID-19 cases. It leads the nation in coronavirus deaths, according to the World Health Organization.
Among issues criticized by the two governors are the White House's decision to block a Department of Health and Human Services plan to utilize the U.S. Postal Service to ship five face masks to every household in the country, free of charge, in April.

That decision by the White House came to light after the USPS released thousands of documents that showed some officials hoped to use the USPS network to help Americans get personal protective equipment with a plan to send a pack of five reusable face masks to every residential address in the U.S.
The hardest-hit areas in the nation would be shipped to first. Wayne County was among those, along with the Orleans and Jefferson parishes in Louisiana, King County, Washington, and New York.
But the plan was scrapped, according to The Washington Post, due to a concern sending masks would cause mass concern or panic.
""Imagine the lives that could have been saved if every household were provided masks at such a crucial time,"" the statement said.
Other issues addressed by the governor included how last week political appointees at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said people without symptoms did not need to get tested for the coronavirus.
Trump's inclusion in Bob Woodward's new book, which claims that Trump knew of the dangers of the coronavirus long before he let on, was also mentioned by Whitmer and Cuomo.
""As a country, we cannot allow this type of politically-motivated decision making to take root,"" their statement said. ""Logic dictates that COVID won't be the last public health challenge we will face, and we can't afford to again respond by playing politics, instead of listening to the science and facts.
""Our future health and economic security depends on holding the Trump administration accountable today."""
131,/michigan/detroit/whitmer-2021-michigan-budget-focuses-education-health,2020-09-24T11:08:09Z,Whitmer: 2021 Michigan Budget Focuses On...,0,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — The 2021 Michigan budget focuses on improving education, health programs and other key issues, such as expanding broadband internet services during a time of virtual learning across the state.
The budget — Whitmer's second — will deliver on many of Whitmer's signature priorities, including the Michigan Reconnect program for a tuition-free pathway for adults, funding for the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies program to ensure women have the care they need for a healthy pregnancy, and expanding access to childcare for families, Whitmer's office said in a news release.
""When we started the budget process in early February, nobody had an idea of how challenging the coming months would be, no knowledge of the devastating impacts that COVID-19 would have, including the impact to our state budget,"" Whitmer said. ""But Michigan is strong, and by working collaboratively with our partners in the Legislature we now have a budget I will soon be signing, a budget that funds shared priorities that will move Michigan forward.""
The budget includes $161 million in flexible per pupil spending which could help districts address the increased costs of educating students in the midst of a pandemic, Whitmer said.
About $30 million has been allocated for the Michigan Reconnect program to provide a tuition-free pathway for adults looking to upskill and earn a postsecondary certificate or associate degree, according to Whitmer's office. Implementing Reconnect will help close the skills gap and move the state closer to reaching 60 percent postsecondary educational attainment by 2030, according to a news release.
The budget includes $5.6 million for mental health counselors to assist children in schools with mental health needs.
A goal to attract and retain first-year teachers in Michigan school districts is funded by $5 million in incentives.
Literacy coaches and resources to improved training for educators in the field of literacy learning was given a $3 million boost.
Of note during the pandemic, $2 million was budgeted for additional supports to assist vulnerable students who are learning remotely, including special education students, students who are chronically absent and children in need of childcare while their parents are working.
About $2 million was budgeted for Detroit Public TV, to foster early childhood initiatives to enhance learning and early education.
The implementation of previously announced teacher hazard payments of up to $500 per teacher, along with the addition of payments of up to $250 for school support staff, was also included in the budget.
About $1 million was allocated for school meal debt forgiveness.
""This has been a budget cycle unlike any other, but in the end we have been able to work collaboratively and put together a budget that reflects many of the Governor's key priorities and values,"" State Budget Director Chris Kolb said. ""I am pleased that we will soon have a budget in place for the new fiscal year which begins October 1, but I still have concerns about projected revenues loses for Fiscal Year 2022 and we still need Congress to provide states with new federal funding.""
When it comes to budget priorities for the health of families across Michigan, the budget will include:
About $12.6 million was budgeted for the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies program to ensure women are given the care they need to have a healthy pregnancy and to expand support for interventions that are proven to improve outcomes.
Access to childcare for families was expanded through a $26 million budget line aiming to help increase the income limit from 130 percent to 150 percent of the federal poverty level, expanding childcare services to nearly 6,000 children.
Direct care workers assisting the elderly and other vulnerable individuals during the pandemic will see a $2/hour wage increase through a $135 million budget allocation. The budget also includes $20 million in additional support for nursing homes for COVID-19-related cost increases.
About $20 million was budgeted to support the state's psychiatric hospitals so that Michiganders in need of mental health services have improved access and care.
The Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund has a $2 million line to protect Michigan families from lead in their homes.
About $10 million was budgeted to implement policies to keep more children with families rather than entering congregate care.
First responders can receive mental health services through a $2.5 million budget allocation.
""The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the challenges and disparities that have prevented far too many Michiganders from realizing their fullest potential,"" Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist said. ""The budget that we've put forth is an opportunity to take a proactive, deliberate approach toward investing in the health, education, and economic well-being of those who need it the most. This budget sets a foundation to make expand access to opportunity for all of the people who call this state home.""
The 2021 budget will include critical funding for programs within the Department of Labor and Economic Development and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, including $100 million for business attraction efforts, according to Whitmer's office. A total of $28.7 million will be provided for the Going Pro program to support job training grants to businesses to support training for current and new employees in high-demand, skilled trades industries. New funding of $3 million is provided for a statewide pre-apprenticeship program with the goal of developing qualified candidates for building trades apprenticeships in the construction industry. Funding for the popular Pure Michigan campaign will be set at $15 million.
The budget will also provide funding for critical initiatives directed at the environment, including $5 million that will draw down significantly more in federal funding for the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program to reduce runoff of contaminants into Lake Erie and other watersheds, according to a news release. The budget will add $1 million to Michigan Saves to help Michigan families make energy efficiency improvements to their homes.
A total of $4.2 million will be provided to begin implementing the pre-trial incarceration task force recommendation for crisis intervention and de-escalation training through the Michigan Coalition on Law Enforcement Standards, helping ensure law enforcement officers have the training and education they need to intervene successfully. The budget will include $7 million to increase the number of troopers within the Michigan State Police.
The budget will also include $14.3 million in broadband funding to help expand Internet access across the state."
132,/michigan/detroit/men-accused-plot-michigan-governor-attended-protests,2020-10-11T00:04:08Z,Men Accused In Plot On Michigan Governor...,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"From the Associated Press:
LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Among the armed protesters who rallied at the Michigan Capitol against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's coronavirus lockdown this past spring were some of the men now accused in stunning plots to kidnap her, storm the Capitol and start a ""civil war.""
The revelation has sparked scrutiny of rallies that were organized by conservative groups opposed to the Democratic governor's orders and egged on by President Donald Trump. It has also prompted renewed calls from Democrats for a gun ban in the building — an effort that so far has failed even after they reported feeling threatened by rifle-carrying men who entered the Statehouse.
At least one man accused of aiding in the surveillance of Whitmer's home as part of the alleged scheme to kidnap her stood in the Senate gallery on April 30 as majority Republicans refused to extend an emergency declaration that was the underpinning of Whitmer's stay-at-home and other restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Some lawmakers and staffers reported feeling intimidated. ""Several"" of the 13 men arrested in the plots against the state government were seen at Capitol protests this year, the state attorney general's office said.
A man whom the FBI identified in court papers as a leader in the alleged plot, Adam Fox, attended an ""American Patriot"" pro-gun rights rally at the Capitol on June 18 to recruit members of anti-government paramilitary groups to attack the Statehouse, according to a federal complaint that cites a recording from a confidential informant.
""I'm not surprised — and anyone who is just hasn't been paying attention,"" Whitmer told The Associated Press by phone on Friday. There have been Republican lawmakers and at least one sheriff at the protests, she said, ""who fraternize with these domestic terror groups, who egg them on, who encourage them, who use language that incites them. They too are complicit.""
Some of the men involved in the alleged plots were members and leaders of Wolverine Watchmen, which authorities described as ""an anti-government, anti-law enforcement militia group."" Federal authorities became aware in March about an initial plan by Wolverine Watchmen to target and kill police, according to court papers. Officials have not indicated whether law enforcement monitored the anti-lockdown protests in April and May.
Such protests have attracted a range of people, including openly armed Second Amendment backers and members of paramilitary groups dressed in tactical gear — particularly early in the pandemic when some demonstrators displayed Confederate flags, misogynistic anti-Whitmer signs and threatening images. GOP leaders have denounced such tactics while saying many people protest safely and responsibly.
The state's Republican Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, ""does not condone violence, does not embrace violence and has never advocated in support of violence,"" spokeswoman Amber McCann said. ""Like many politicians, he has spoken out when he disagreed with policy.""
Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf told WXMI-TV that maybe the men wanted to arrest Whitmer, not kidnap her, and suggested that could be legal. At least one man charged under the state's anti-terrorism law by Attorney General Dana Nessel appeared on stage in May at a protest in Grand Rapids against Whitmer's stay-at-home order that was also attended by the sheriff and Shirkey.
Nessel, a Democrat, told the AP that Leaf's remarks were ""terrifying.""
""To suggest that it is proper for armed gunmen who are not licensed law enforcement officers to execute an arrest on a sitting governor for policy disagreements is abhorrent to me on every level,"" she said.
The bombshell charges prompted Democratic legislators to plead, again, for the GOP-led Legislature to prohibit firearms inside the Capitol.
The federal complaint alleges that Fox in June said he needed 200 men to storm the building and take hostages, including Whitmer, and that several individuals talked about using Molotov cocktails to destroy police vehicles. By July, the men had shifted to targeting Whitmer's official summer residence or her personal vacation home before settling on the latter, according to authorities.
""We literally dodged death this time — this time. But what about next time? Because there'll be a next time,"" said Sen. Dayna Polehanki, a Democrat. ""I pray we use our God-given common sense to make a law banning guns from this building. If not now, when?""
It is unclear if anything will change. Republican leaders are having further discussions about guns with a commission that maintains the Capitol. A panel member noted that legislators have authority over certain areas of the building including the voting chambers.
""From the evidence I've read, a magnetometer or similar equipment would not have stopped what was planned,"" John Truscott said. Shirkey told reporters: ""There is no way in a country like ours that you can legislate and get rid of all risk.""
Whitmer told the AP she is concerned about the safety of lawmakers, visiting schoolchildren, media and others.
""The Legislature needs to act to protect everyone at the Capitol,"" she said. ""It is all of our building and every one of us should be able to go in there and feel safe.""
Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said the anti-government movement in the U.S. and certainly in Michigan has been particularly active at statehouses in the past year — first by opposing proposed ""red flag"" laws that allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from people deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others, and later by opposing governors' measures to combat the pandemic.
""Militia groups and other actors who harbor violent agendas will continue to look for opportunities to conduct attacks against politicians, community members and government officials whom they believe are legitimate targets,"" said Javed Ali, a former senior counterterrorism director at the National Security Council who is a policymaker in residence at the University of Michigan.

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The State and County have been hit hard by Covid. The Business world is reeling and trying to get back on their feet again. I have been an active member of the Wayne County ""Back to Work"" task force. The County has distributed over 50 million dollars worth of grants to small businesses to help with their expenses. I am a member of the WC Ways and Means Committee and have worked very hard to balance the budget for the next two years in spite of the uncertainty of our final income numbers. The priority of our newly passed budget is to continue to serve the citizens of Wayne County, including fixing our roads and infrastructure, public safety and public health.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
My experience. I have been the County Commissioner for the past 5 years, besides my in-depth municipal experience. I am the appointed Chair of the Committee on Public Services which includes oversight of roads and parks. Wayne County Parks are a passion of mine. I have a goal of expanding the accessibility of our park system and developing our parks into areas that families, young adults and people of all ages can enjoy. Wayne County has many exciting plans and ideas to meet the goal of increasing the usage of our park system.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have been the Commissioner in Livonia, Northville and the City of Northville for 5 years.I have shown that I can work very well with the elected officials in all three areas, working closely with them to get road projects done, make improvements on park projects and anything else they may desire from the county. I am the only Republican on the Wayne County Commission but am appointed by the Chair of the Commission to chair the Public Services Committee and serve as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. I am very accessible to the public through sending newsletters, holding office hours, making phone contact and answering emails. I work for the public and that never leaves my mind.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
As a member of the ""Back to Work"" task force, we have worked with small business and developed plans to assist them in getting started again. The task force will continue as we enter winter months which could adversely affect businesses as they move forward. Wayne County granted almost 12,000 businesses monies form the CARES ACT and we are completely focused on what we can do to help them along.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
The Conference of Western Wayne and the NAACP starred ""listening tours"" that were to take place through 18 communities. These tours were to be dialogues between the police and community citizens. The first couple tours were held and then COVID hit our community. The tours stopped. The groups are attempting ""virtual"" tours in the future. Communication and dialogue are needed to address the concerns on both sides of these groups.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
I am elected to work and protect the constituents of my areas. I filed a law suit, along with the Wayne County Commission, to stop a ballot proposal that would have been placed on this November ballot. This would have cost the people of Wayne County $42 million dollars of increased taxes, if passed. The County Commission would have had zero control how how this money would have been spent. I had very significance concerns that the areas I represent, would not have seen the benefits of this huge tax increase. The areas I represent pay many taxes and I will not be part of any program in the County that will raise taxes further.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I have been given positions of leadership by my colleagues, all of whom are the opposite party of me. I get things done, whether trying to help a citizen, working with elected officials, working with organizations or just donating to great organizations in the district. I am the only County Commissioner that posts my office budget on line. The public is my boss and I take this position very seriously."

Almost immediately after Trump's series of tweets, Whitmer responded in similar fashion.
""Mr. President, I thought you weren't interested in a virtual debate?"" she said, referring to Trump's recent decision not to have a debate with Biden because officials wanted to host the debate virtually amid Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis.
Officials announced that 13 people had been indicted in the plot against Whitmer as of Thursday, including residents from across the state.
Authorities became aware of the conspiracy in early 2020, and gathered more information through informants, officials said Thursday.
Group members said they wanted to form to follow the U.S. Bill of Rights and live where they could be self-sufficient, according to federal documents.
The group gathered at various times and training with guns and performed tactical drills, according to the documents.
Plans included kidnapping the governor from her vacation home, going to her home to ""cap her"" and even storming the Capitol building with 200 men and taking hostages, documents show.

Speaker of the House, Republican Lee Chatfield, responded to the plots against Whitmer by saying violence won't be tolerated.
""Violence has no place in politics. Ever,"" he tweeted. ""It's never a solution to disagreements. The people who targeted @GovWhitmer and police officers are un-American. Justice should be swift and severe. It's time to send a message that violence will not be tolerated.""
Republican Sen. Aric Nesbitt said there is no place for violence in American politics.
""Thank goodness for the strong & swift work of law enforcement to stop this disturbing & dangerous plot,"" he said. ""Americans act through the ballot box, terrorists use violence. Prayers for the continued safety of Michigan's first family.""

Whitmer said on Monday she is seeking clarification regarding when the ruling takes effect. Her administration has interpreted Michigan Supreme Court law in saying that the ruling would take effect 21 days from when it was issued. However, GOP legislators have said it would take effect immediately.
In the meantime, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon has issued his own share of emergency orders, citing a different law as grounds to do so.
Gordon on Monday issued an emergency order restricting gathering sizes, requiring face coverings in public spaces and placing limitations on bars and other venues.
The order relies on authorities that were first enacted after the Spanish Flu of 1918 and that were not at issue in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, the MDHHS said.
Local communities have also taken their own approach to maintain mask requirements during the pandemic, which has resulted in nearly 130,000 confirmed cases in Michigan, while claiming the lives of more than 6,800. Oakland County initially issued a health order requiring masks in public spaces. However, the county rescinded its order once Gordon's order took effect.
Ingham County, which encompasses Lansing and has had recent outbreaks of the coronavirus, also issued orders requiring masks and limiting restaurant capacity at 50 percent.
The orders do not create new restrictions or requirements, but remove uncertainty around the continuation of precautionary measures for Ingham County residents and businesses, Ingham County Health Officer Linda S. Vail said."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The double pandemic of COVID-19 and racism. As state representative I intend to tackle the inequity faced by Black and Brown communities in environment, education, employment, and healthcare.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a product of my district. My parents moved to Hamtramck from Yemen, where my father has worked as autoworker. I was raised in House District 4 in a working class family. My political career has been shaped by advocating for our district, including the fight to shut down the incinerator that was polluting our community.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
At a young age, I began by knocking doors for President Obama during his campaign. I have worked as legislative staff for former representatives, and most recently I was a surrogate for Senator Bernie Sanders during his presidential campaign.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
The state government should keep the moratorium on evictions and water shutoffs in place and the pandemic is over. Local businesses should be provided with the resources necessary to allow them to safely reopen and operate. As the winter is around the corner, we must be prepared to support businesses whose hospitality can only be conducted in doors.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
I plan to work in coalition with what community organizers in my district are advocating for. Together, we can work using our various outlets to enact change. So much change happens within communities, and I plan to channel their powerful activism and bring that to the State House floor. I will vote on legislation that reduces presence and power of police in communities of color, to decriminalize our schools, and protect protesters rights.

Police accountability - End qualified immunity in the state / end civil asset forfeiture / expunge records of non-violent marijuana offenders
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I will focus on representing the people who elected me, not a political party. Partisan politics should never take priority over representing the residents of my district.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
As a business owner, I have experienced hardships as a direct result of government overreach hindering business growth and the freedom to run your own company as you see fit.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
Encourage businesses to take precautions, as they see fit, while they are being allowed to return to normal operations. Incentivize taking precautionary measures rather than ""stiff-arm"" business owners into rigid state-enforced guidelines of health and sanitation.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
We must address qualified immunity, illegal search and seizure, civil asset forfeiture, enforcement of laws that produce victimless crimes and the inherently racist war on drugs. These are some of the major things that serve to put law enforcement and the community at odds with one another.

Equity. Identifying systems and institutions which are not working equitably for everyone and making the necessary changes. The BOPC is uniquely positioned to accomplish this through, but not limited to, DPD policy enforcement, review & change.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
My educational background is in research study design and analysis. I'm ready to review data and ask the right questions of DPD. If elected, I would be the only professional academic on the Police Commission, my skills will compliment the current make-up of the Commission.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
While at Schoolcraft as a full-time faculty, I negotiated 2 faculty union labor contracts, one in 2015 and one in 2018. I also conducted the oversight and enforcement of those contracts, managing all grievances and representing faculty for 5 years. In 2019 I was recognized by peers with the Faculty Union Service Award. I'm proud of the work our Union Executive Team did to secure good working conditions and wages for our members. Police Commissioner provides an opportunity to write, review and enforce policy which make policing and our community safer.
I've created a Critical Race Theory unit in my Educational Psychology course, a course for K-12 teachers in training. I'm currently working on a entire psychology course dedicated to Racism and Discrimination, with the goal of getting Schoolcraft's Education, Nursing and Criminal Justice programs to require it. I was able to initiate a change in the criminal justice associates at Schoolcraft that required Introduction to Psychology for all students enrolled in that program. In 2018 I was honored to receive the Faculty Teaching Excellence Award.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
Public safety is directly linked to opportunity. Increasing opportunity through the use of public funds to keep businesses open when possible could help.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
Increasing transparency and accountability through policy enforcement and review. Making the necessary changes when policies are not working for our community. This would include but not limited to issues of training requirements, surveillance policy, complaint processes and reporting.

I am running for Police Commissioner because I believe in the power of community to drive change.

This is a time of reckoning and a reexamination, a time to re-imagining public safety. It will require understanding of the history, looking to the research, best practices, national trends and listening to residents which are all important variables when participating in any oversight practice. I'm ready to integrate all those variables and engage in whatever dialogue is needed for the health and safety of both police and our community. With the support and input of my district and fellow commissioners I am ready to serve. Thank you for allowing me to share my experience and vision.

Remove unnecessary regulations, reduce red-tape, and reform occupational licensing requirements that prevent individuals from starting or growing business. Government needs to be a partner. Additionally, distribution of emergency funds should be allocated to small businesses first. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and critical partners in our communities.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?

Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon Tuesday issued an order requiring K-12 schools to provide public notice to the school community about probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19 within 24 hours.
The order requires local health departments to notify schools within 24 hours of learning of a probable or confirmed school-associated case of COVID-19. Once notified, schools must provide public notification on a highly visible location on the school's website that covers the impacted building or location within 24 hours.
""Recent outbreaks throughout the country demonstrate that COVID-19 can spread quickly in the school setting,"" Gordon said in a news release. ""Timely communication from schools to parents, guardians, students, teachers, staff and other persons affiliated with schools enables members of the school community to take measures to prevent spread of the virus.""
The order goes into effect on Monday."
146,/michigan/detroit/some-michigan-clerks-can-count-ballots-early-under-new-bill,2020-10-06T17:38:38Z,Some Michigan Clerks Can Process Ballots Early...,0,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — A new bill signed into law Tuesday by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will allow some election clerks to begin processing absentee ballots early.
But the news of the new bill was tarnished, as Whitmer and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson chastised legislators for not having a ready a second bill that would allow servicemembers overseas to submit votes electronically through a secured portal.
""Elections are no time to play partisan games,"" Whitmer said. ""Our brave service members and their families put their lives on the line for us and they deserve leaders who are going to help them vote.""
The bill Whitmer signed into law will allow election clerks in communities of at least 25,000 people begin processing absentee ballots a day before the Nov. 3 election.
Whitmer announced the bill Tuesday afternoon during a news conference. The move was made as the state reports that more than 2.6 million registered voters have already issued absentee ballots.
""This year, millions of Michiganders will take advantage of their constitutional right to vote absentee for the first time due to this pandemic,"" Whitmer said. ""The bill ensures that clerks will notify voters of any reason that their vote won't be counted within 48 hours.""
Benson said the bill will benefit the state not only in 2020, but in elections moving forward. She called absentee voting a ""new normal"" and a ""modern normal.""
""This is a step in the right direction and it will enable some communities to begin processing and preparing ballots to be counted the day before,"" she said.
Benson said on Monday that the Michigan Department of State has launched a statewide multimedia initiative to inform voters how to utilize the options they have to vote.
Advertisements are being placed on social media, the internet, television and the back of ATM receipts. Absentee ballot applications will be inserted in dozens of newspapers, and available at Kroger stores statewide in a push to ensure everyone has a chance to register to vote if they haven't already.
""Michigan citizens have proven with record-breaking turnout numbers in each of our state's three successful elections this year that they want to vote,"" Benson said. ""It is my responsibility to ensure they know their options to do so safely and securely from home, early at their local clerk's office, or at their polling place on Election Day.""
But while Whitmer and Benson celebrated the move to allow clerks additional time to count ballots, both sounded off about a bill that was not signed Tuesday. Whitmer said she was hopeful to sign a bill Tuesday to allow servicemembers overseas or unable to cast their ballot in person to return ballots electronically, but that didn't happen, she said, because legislative leaders haven't sent her the bill. She said she wasn't sure why there has been a delay.
Benson used a personal anecdote in voicing her frustration over the delay. Citing a time when her husband, a member of the military who was stationed in Afghanistan and was unable to vote in 2012 because provisions weren't in place, Benson said she was disappointed the bill wasn't ready to be signed.
""I was hoping to celebrate the recognition of the law, that the Senate and the House passed enabling military service members serving overseas and their spouses to complete their ballots and return them electronically through a secure portal,"" she said. ""It was very disappointing to see this particular piece of legislation — and our military service members — used as political pawns for partisan gamesmanship."""

Gretchen Whitmer is urging residents to wear masks and practice social distancing as disputes continue between state officials regarding her executive powers.
Whitmer late Monday released a video on social media calling out to Michiganders, state legislature, President Donald Trump and Congress to each do their part to assist families, front line workers and small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
""For the past seven months, I've been making the tough decisions that took us from the state with the 3rd highest cases of COVID-19 per million in March and April, to the 33rd highest in September,"" Whitmer said.

As of Monday, Michigan has reported nearly 130,000 cases of the coronavirus. More than 6,800 people in the state have died from COVID-19, according to state health officials. Nearly 100,000 people in Michigan have recovered from the virus.
Whitmer said that Michigan has seen one of the best economic recoveries in the nation, adding that studies conclude actions taken by her administration saved thousands of lives.
But the governor said partisan politics led to a Michigan Supreme Court ruling Friday that takes away her executive authority, a move she said will lead to increased cases and ""uncertainty, disruption, and possibly greater risk to our economy, more people quarantined, and more deaths.""
Questions remain regarding when the Supreme Court's decision takes effect. State GOP leaders such as House Speaker Lee Chatfield have maintained that the decision was effective immediately, while Whitmer's administration has interpreted Michigan Supreme Court law in a way that would give them a 21-day grace period before the ruling takes effect.
Whitmer asked for clarity on the issue Monday along with Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon, who went so far as to issue his own emergency order restricting gathering sizes and requiring face coverings in public spaces.
""The CDC and public health experts agree that wearing masks and practicing safe physical distancing are crucial to slow the spread of the virus, protect our frontline workers, and keep our schools and small businesses open,"" Whitmer said. ""Michiganders, here's what we need you to do: please take this virus seriously by wearing a mask when you go out, washing hands, and maintaining six feet of physical distance. Get a flu shot. Taking this action is essential to keeping our small businesses and schools open. COVID 19 didn't stop being a threat because the court ruling, or because we've tired of it, or because the legislature left town.
""Let us not squander the sacrifice we have made to get to this point. We all have to do our part. You can protect the brave men and women on the front lines who are working every day to keep us safe. The health care workers and first responders, grocery store employees, child care workers, and all of the people who have been putting their lives on the line since day one.""

Gretchen Whitmer's emergency powers were struck down Friday by the Michigan Supreme Court, which ruled that a 1945 law she was citing was unconstitutional.
So, now what? As it turns out, several other entities have taken safety measures amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic into their own hands and some restrictions will remain in place.
Don't miss important updates from health and government officials on the impact of the coronavirus in Michigan. Sign up for Patch's daily newsletters and email alerts.
The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday, which Whitmer has called a matter of partisan politics, has raised several legal questions Whitmer's office said it is still reviewing.
Many of the questions concern when the previously issued executive orders will be voided. Whitmer's office previously said they would not take effect until 21 days from the court's ruling, citing Michigan Supreme Court law.
""When it comes to fighting COVID-19, we are all in this together,"" Whitmer's office said in a statement. ""While we are moving swiftly, this transition will take time. As the governor said last week, many of the responsive measures she has put in place to control the spread of the virus will continue under alternative sources of authority that were not at issue in the court's ruling. We will have more to say on this in the coming days. Make no mistake, Governor Whitmer will continue using every tool at her disposal to keep Michigan families, frontline workers, and small businesses safe from this deadly virus.""
A day after the Michigan Supreme Court made its ruling to remove some of Whitmer's executive powers, Oakland County was among Michigan communities to step up and implement their own orders.
Oakland County Health Officer Leigh-Anne Stafford on Saturday issued local health order 2020-12, requiring that people wear masks or facial coverings when outside their home in Oakland County.
Stafford said additional health orders may be issued in the coming days to cover capacity at restaurants, bars, employee health screenings and other public health concerns.
""Health and science experts agree that facial coverings are critical to controlling the virus,"" Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. ""We have come too far to backslide now especially as we want to get kids back to school and our economy moving again. In Oakland County masks will continue to be mandatory by order of our health experts. I am confident that our residents and businesses will continue to keep each other safe and protected.""
The order covers residents who are in any public space outside their home, including K-12 schools and when outside and social distancing isn't possible. Children under 5 and people who cannot medically tolerate facial coverings are among exceptions.
""Oakland County was hit hard by the COVID-19 and the virus is still in our communities,"" Stafford said. ""The law provides the tools for a local health officer to protect the public's health during an epidemic and that is my solemn responsibility. We will work closely with State health officials on additional measures to control the virus.""
Oakland County wasn't alone in its hasty response. Ingham County, which encompasses Lansing and has had recent outbreaks of the coronavirus, also issued orders requiring masks and limiting restaurant capacity at 50 percent.
The orders do not create new restrictions or requirements, but remove uncertainty around the continuation of precautionary measures for Ingham County residents and businesses, Ingham County Health Officer Linda S. Vail said
""Health and science experts agree that facial coverings, social distancing and health screenings are critical to controlling the virus,"" Vail said. ""We have made too much progress to regress. We are working hard to get our young people back to school, keep our businesses and government open, and make progress in our economic recovery.""
While Whitmer's executive orders will be voided later this month, several orders issued by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services will remain in effect.
Several of the orders include testing for Michigan jails and prisoners, as well as testing at nursing homes and visitation restrictions.
A full list of the orders can be viewed here.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said her office will no longer enforce Whitmer's executive orders in light of the Michigan Supreme Court's Friday ruling.
However, she said, her decision is not binding on other law enforcement agencies or state departments with independent enforcement authority.
""It's her fervent hope that people continue to abide by the measures that Governor Whitmer put in place - like wearing face masks, adhering to social distancing requirements and staying home when sick - since they've proven effective at saving lives,"" said Ryan Jervi, Nessel's press secretary. ""If it weren't for the Governor's actions, countless more of our friends, family and neighbors would have been lost to COVID-19. We can respect both the court's decision and the advice of medical experts by continuing with these important measures voluntarily.""

Whitmer said she has only made such orders to protect Michigan residents during the crisis that has — to date — led to more than over 126,000 confirmed cases in the state and killed over 6,700.
She had, for six months, imposed restrictions on Michigan's economy, school systems and other sectors in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus.
Earlier Friday, she issued an order restricting Michigan's Upper Peninsula, requiring schools to enforce mask requirements and restricting social gatherings amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in the region.
Whitmer's orders remain in effect for another 21 days despite the ruling, and Whitmer said that after the 21-day period many of the responsive measures put in place will continue under alternative sources of authority not issue in Friday's ruling.
""I want the people of Michigan to know that no matter what happens, I will never stop fighting to keep you and your families safe from this deadly virus,"" she said.

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The biggest single problem is the lack of economic and social justice. I will make all my efforts to achieve a radical reconstruction of the economy, society and the state to achieve justice for the working class.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a believer and supporter of the program of the Working Class Party. No other party has the understanding of the problems the working class faces, and no clear idea of them, nor intention of dealing with these problems. I have confidence in the working class to reorder society.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My sense of modesty limits the answer I can give to this question. But I can say that I was born and raised in the working class, and I spent most of my working life dealing with the problems that people face in trying to find justice, first as a teacher, then as an investigator and public servant.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
The state government is limited by the capitalist structures of this society, which both parties support. The goal has to be to attack and get rid of capitalist exploitation of the working class.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
I will support and work for the implementation of the program of the Working Class Party. Police reform, like all piecemeal reforms, can't solve problems. What's needed is a total reconstruction of the economy and society so every person has the right to the same good education, and to a decent job with decent pay.

Gretchen Whitmer on Friday responded to comments made by President Donald Trump, who said she wanted to be a ""dictator"" in Michigan.
""One week after a plot to kidnap and murder me was revealed, the President renewed his attacks,"" Whitmer said in a tweet Friday. ""Words matter. I am asking people of goodwill on both sides of the aisle — please, lower the heat of this dangerous rhetoric.""
Trump said Whitmer wanted to be a dictator in an interview on FOX Business Thursday morning while discussing Democratic governors around the nation.
""Michigan, she has to open up,"" Trump said, referring to Whitmer. ""She wants to be a dictator in Michigan and the people can't stand her. They want to get back and they want to get back to work.""

Whitmer's response is the latest in a social media back-and-forth between she and the president, who have both taken shots at the other on Twitter.
Last week, Whitmer said Trump was complicit in violent plots to kidnap her because he failed to condemn groups such as the Wolverine Watchmen.
""When our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight,"" she said at the time. ""When our leaders meet with, encourage or fraternize with domestic terrorists. They legitimize their actions, and they are complicit.""
Trump responded on social media, saying Whitmer had done a terrible job as governor."

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Friday issued direction to local election clerks statewide clarifying that the open carry of firearms on Election Day in polling places, clerk's offices and absent voter counting boards is prohibited on Nov. 3.
""Fair, free and secure elections are the foundation of our democracy,"" Benson said. ""I am committed to ensuring all eligible Michigan citizens can freely exercise their fundamental right to vote without fear of threats, intimidation or harassment. Prohibiting the open-carry of firearms in areas where citizens cast their ballots is necessary to ensure every voter is protected.""
Benson issued the directive Friday morning, telling all clerks that, ""The presence of firearms at the polling place, clerk's office(s), or absent voter counting board may cause disruption, fear, or intimidation for voters, election workers, and others present. Absent clear standards, there is potential for confusion and uneven application of legal requirements for Michigan's 1,600 election officials, 30,000 election inspectors, 8 million registered voters, and thousands of challengers and poll watchers on Election Day.""
The rule prohibits firearms within 100 feet of any polling place entrance.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Michigan State Police Director Col. Joe Gasper have both said they support Benson's decision and that they will ensure the rule is enforced statewide.
""Michigan voters have the right to vote in person on Election Day free from threat and intimidation,"" Nessel said. ""An armed presence at the polls is inconsistent with our notion of a free democracy. I stand with the Secretary in her commitment to ensure that every eligible voter who wants to vote in person can do so safely and without fear or intimidation.""
""Michiganders should know that law enforcement across multiple levels is working together to ensure that anyone who wishes to exercise their right to vote in-person on election day can do so safely and without the threat of intimidation,"" Gasper said.

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The most pressing issue right now is ""Mask Mandates"". I intend to ban the idea of forcing Americans to wear them. In theory, I truly agree with President Trump regarding the ""Staged Coup"". I believe that in Michigan, The Governor is forcing us to wear mask to conduct what is called "" facial recognition"". Something that citizens voted against. We are being viewed on various surveillance systems to identify any one who goes inside of local stores and gas stations that have a green light with a mask on their face. The government figured out a way to conduct such efforts to identify those with mask covering their whole face with exception to having the eyes show only. I believe that Michiganders along with all of Americans have been hoodwinked and bamboozled into the unconstitutional act against our right to privacy. I plan to find out how we can cure the Coronavirus disease without that horrible mask. We are all looking like bank robbers out here.we have to speak up and stick together to find a cure that will cure us from these mask. I will work hard to do so..
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a single black mom who gave birth to 10 children. I grew up in poverty and know what it is like to be homeless with nowhere to go. I understand first hand how various programs and government fundings are NOT being used to help the homeless get housing in a timely manner. This is wrong. To abuse funding that was initialized for the homeless and pocket the money for themsves. Also, I gave birth to all 10 children. I didn't complain of morning sickness, I gave all of my children a Right to Life. I am prolife. I will never back down from protection of the unborn. I am a second chancer who was wrongfully convicted of a crime that clearly violated my second amendment rights to bear arms. I know about some of the bad police. Namely the two who lied in the stand and under oath to get a conviction on a law abiding citizen as myself. As a woman, I was bullied by these officers. Does that make me angry? Yes. Just not angry at all officers across the globe. Those were a few bad police. I know too many good police to hold a grudge. That is why I will be a fair and non bias vote in Congress. I will NOT support defunding of the police because of my personal encounter, instead, I will write policies to get rid of bad officers and will find incentives to offer for good ones. 13th Congressional District is over 50% Black population. My opponents are not black. They will not be able to address the ongoing obstacles that stand in our way. I am the person who can reach the minds and hearts of 13th Congressional because I am 13th. They are Articia Bomer. I know what their needs are and my policies will go hand in hand to service all. I have not only help my counter persons of color, but I have helped a mass amount of immigrants seeking a life in America to obtain a visa for permanent residency. I love all people. I can help all. I am an inovator. I create bills. I am a people's person who will be able to work with any commander and chief and also all members of Congress including all constituents of the White House. I am the new face for the race. I have a desire to overturn all wrong and make everything right.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
Ever since I was born. I have been moving up the latter. From being valedictorian in elementary school. To 1st chair flute and saxophone in Middle school. My very first job was working at Mc Donald's. I was only there for a short period of time before being asked to become first shift supervisor. I remember when I was hired into chrysler in 1995, I remember being asked to travel to UAW Leadership school located in Black Lake MI. I was asked to stand in for then committee shop chairman. Also being chosen as Student Council President @ Le Cordon Bleu Culinary College in Las Vegas. In my life time, others have always found me to be the leader of the bunch. I will take that drive and energy all the way to Congress where I hope to someday become Speaker of The House.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
I will assist the President who wins with a budget to purchase covid items such as hand sanitizer, gloves and mask as a form of temporary ppe. These items shall come free of charge. After all, we are all infected and affected by this silent killer.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
I will take down the Communist Black Lives Matter Movement and make it a peaceful one. The one they have now is becoming a chaotic situation that demands defunding of the police. I will not allow that to happen. In order to stop the violence of blacks against police, we must mediate and defuse the madness. I am the perfect negotiater. I will bring peace to the black community and to our local police departments. I will build trust in my community and hold bad officers responsible for their actions.

Three weeks ago, I Articia Bomer gave my life back to Jesus Christ from being a muslim for 12 years. Not to say that being a muslim was a bad thing. I embraced the culture but found that America was based off the Holy Bible. I am an American. I want to die an American. I was at an Evangelicals for Trump event on September 22, 2020 a church called Motor City Church. It was then I realized that I needed God to save my life and to be the force behind my campaign. My slogan is... if God ain't in it, I cannot win it. I know I am a small fish swimming in a big pond trying to get into Congress. I also know that alot of voters do not know me or have heard of me. Alot of people say that I may as well give up on my campaign. That I only have less than 2 weeks and no one will vote me in. Well, I beg to differ. After giving my life to Christ, I have no doubts that I can win this race in this spiritual warfare campaign. God created the Heavens and Earth's in 6 days and rest on the 7th day. I have more than 7 days left. I can do all things thru Christ that strengthen me. I am here to spread my love and black Joy in Congress. Please give me a chance America. I beg of you. Thank you all and God Bless America and Everywhere else.
Vote For Articia Bomer on November 3, 2020 in Jesus Christ name I pray. Amen"

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Managing the COVID-19 crisis and rebuilding an equitable Michigan economy. The COVID-19 crisis has critically damaged our economy. The current general unemployment rate in Michigan is 8.5%. Among African Americans the unemployment rate is 35.5% and maybe higher. This sad fact underscores the reality laid bare by the pandemic. There are widespread disparities and inequities in employment and business opportunities between whites and blacks in Michigan.
The crisis is also revealing the enormous disparity in access to quality health care services. African Americans only represent 14.1% of the state's population yet they are 20% of the state's 139,061 COVID-19 cases and 37% of the reported deaths. This data clearly reflects the inequity in access to affordable wellness and health care treatment services. Many of these COVID-19 victims work in low paying essential service jobs and are more susceptible to infection because they are required to work in these Frontline positions.
I am committed to fighting for and promoting policies that close the employment, health care and education gaps that exist between African Americans and other vulnerable populations like seniors. We need to remove racial discriminatory barriers that limit job and business opportunities for blacks and other minorities. We must also improve availability and accessibility of affordable health services to seniors and disadvantaged groups. These changes will require strengthening existing legislation and proposing new measures that eliminate systemic racism in the job economy, educational institutions, and the health care service community.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am seeking my third term in the Michigan House of Representatives and I understand the challenges facing my district better than my opponent. Equally important, as a member of the House I have gained extensive knowledge and experience about writing legislative policies and improving delivery of state services to my constituents. Also, there is no substitute for the relationships I have established in the legislature and with the governor's office. These contacts are invaluable and absolutely essential to getting things done in state government. My opponent would be challenged to provide effective leadership and representation as he has not served in a state government office.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I am currently serving my second term representing the 11th House District, which comprises all of Garden City and Inkster, and portions of Dearborn Heights, Livonia and Westland. Jones is Vice Chair of the Military, Veterans and Homeland Security Committee and is a member of the Regulatory Reform Committee.
Before serving in the Michigan House of Representatives, I was a member of the Inkster City Council. He was also a member of the Inkster Task Force, the Inkster Youth Coalition, the Inkster Chamber of Commerce and more.
I attend the University of Michigan-Dearborn, where I am pursuing a dual major in Political Science and Business Studies. I am also a member of the Michigan National Guard, Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps, an Inkster Auxiliary Police Officer, and a member of the Black Student Union and the Student Veteran Association.
I am a native and lifelong resident of Inkster. I have been active in political campaigns for several years and previously operated a small business. I am a Senior Deacon in his church, The Spiritual Israel Church and Its Army. In the House, I am focused on improving public education, keeping young talent in Michigan, fighting for environmental and social justice, and maintaining strong, vibrant communities.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
I believe the state, federal and local governments should increase funding for new business creation. The state should lead in funding by providing grants and tax incentives that encourage existing and new business development. I will fight for funding to strengthen state and private programs that provide entrepreneurship education, training and mentorship. We should also increase state business opportunities for minority and women owned enterprises. Make more state purchasing opportunities available to disadvantaged businesses.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
We need investments to fight poverty, racial disparities and inequities in the Criminal Justice system. There is little doubt there is widespread systemic racism in the Criminal Justice and Prison systems as evidenced by the number of blacks affected by these institutions. In Michigan Blacks represent 53% of the 38,500 people incarcerated in prison. Additionally a 2017 Michigan State Police (MSP) report on traffic stops showed that African Americans stopped rose from 17% to 21% of the number of stops. Racial profiling is a problem among the MSP and local police as well.
Beyond the inappropriate traffic stops we must strengthen policies that eliminate police brutality and other prohibited behavior. The use of choke holds, chemical sprays and attack dogs should be eliminated to prevent the rising abuse of policing powers in our community. We need to hold violators of acceptable policing practices accountable by enforcing existing laws and incorporating new policies that lead to safer, community policing practices. Violators of break the law should be fired and face criminal prosecution for their offenses.
I am an Inkster Auxiliary Police Officer so I fully understand the challenges officers face daily on the job. We should always be mindful as police officers we are here to ""protect and serve,"" not to exert undue force in executing our responsibilities. I strongly believe we should invest in mental health and service programs that complement our policing efforts with professionals who can assist in dealing with domestic and other matters that do not directly involve criminal offenses.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
I believe the state, federal and local governments should increase funding for education. The state should lead in funding education and local governments should provide additional funding through equitable property tax millage assessment. It is essential that local officials, educational leaders and parents be involved in decisions on whether their schools districts should be abolished or consolidated. I believe educational funding should be based on need and not zip code. We need to find new revenue to fund poorer performing schools. I believe increased funding education is critical because it is essential to strengthening our economic future.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I am running for re-election to the Michigan House of Representative because I am committed to completing the work I began when I decided to seek this office 3 years ago. Voters in my community deserve a government that is responsive and willing to provide equitable services and resources that improve the quality of their lives. I represent communities that are still experiencing significant social and financial challenges because of declining economic conditions. These are working class people that relied heavily on auto manufacturers and other industrial companies for employment until innovation and the tech revolution compelled those companies to leave in the '80s and '90s. While serving in office, my mission is to help lead 11th district communities back to the economic security, social stability, self-dignity, and the quality of life they enjoyed when they were vibrant cities. I am fighting to ensure they receive a fair share of state resources and services to enable them to attract new businesses, restore and strengthen their educational institutions, and become safe, livable communities."

Under the emergency rules, businesses that resume in-person work must have a written COVID-19 preparedness and response plan and provide thorough training to their employees that covers workplace infection-control practices, the proper use of personal protection equipment, steps workers must take to notify the business or operation of any symptoms of COVID-19 or a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and how to report unsafe working conditions, the state said in a news release.
MIOSHA's emergency rules implement workplace safeguards for all Michigan businesses and specific requirements for industries.
The rules establish workplace safety requirements and employers should coordinate these requirements with the emergency order issued by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services restricting gathering sizes and requiring face coverings in public spaces and childcare facilities, the state said.
""As we reengage our economy, the Governor's actions reiterate the importance to keep workplaces safe for employees and protect customers from COVID-19 transmission,"" COVID-19 Workplace Safety Director Sean Egan said in a statement.

Legislators discussed the coronavirus measures in part because many of the issues were addressed by executive orders issued by Whitmer throughout the pandemic. Those orders, however, were deemed null when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the law Whitmer cited in issuing executive orders was unconstitutional.
On Monday, the court reaffirmed its decision by not extending Whitmer's previously issued orders to Oct. 30.
Since the court's initial ruling, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon on has issued emergency orders mirroring orders issued by Whitmer. One issued last week restricts gathering sizes and requires face coverings in pubic spaces.
Gordon's order comes under a legal authority enacted by the Michigan Legislature after the Spanish Flu of 1918 specifically to deal with epidemics, according to a news release. That statute was not at issue in the Supreme Court's ruling, officials said.
Local municipalities, such as Detroit, Wayne and Oakland counties, have also issued localized orders requiring similar measures."

The Michigan Supreme Court voted 4-3 on Oct.2 to strike down months of orders issued by Whitmer during the coronavirus pandemic, saying the 1945 law she cited in issuing the orders was unconstitutional.
Shortly after the ruling, Whitmer responded to the decision by saying she believed it was disappointing, adding that she vehemently disagrees with the move.
""Right now, every state and the federal government have some form of declared emergency,"" Whitmer said at the time. ""With this decision, Michigan will become the sole outlier at a time when the Upper Peninsula is experiencing rates of COVID infection not seen in our state since April.""
However, she believed her orders were to stay in effect for 21 days and asked the court for clarification.
In the meantime, the leading state health official issued his own orders that mirror the orders Whitmer had previously issued.

Local health departments also have taken steps to issue their own orders and require masks and social distancing.
Detroit on Friday joined a growing list of municipalities issuing local emergency orders related to the coronavirus due to uncertainty surrounding statewide orders previously issued by Whitmer and state health officials.
Detroit Public Health Officer Denise Fair on Friday issued a new COVID-19 public health order reinstating several aspects of emergency rulings previously issued by Whitmer.
""We have been in full support of the Governor's orders and the steps she has taken to keep all Michiganders safe,"" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said.

Gretchen Whitmer Monday will make it easier for people who have committed certain felonies and misdemeanors to have their records expunged.
Whitmer on Monday signed House Bills 4980-4985 and 5120, which will allow a person to set aside one or more marijuana offenses if the offense would not have been a crime if committed after Dec. 6, 2018, when recreational marijuana use by adults became legal in Michigan.
""These bipartisan bills are going to be a game changer,"" Whitmer said Monday during a news conference in Detroit. ""They will ensure a clean slate for hundreds of thousands of people, and they will help us grow our workforce and expand access to education and skills training.
""When we help people get a good job so they can put a roof over their head, it is good for our state. It's good for out families, our small businesses and our economy as a whole.""
Whitmer said that research conducted by the University of Michigan law school, which was recently published by the Harvard Law Review, found that people who receive expungements see a 23 percent increase in income within a year. This means more resources for families and communities, and a broader tax base, without any negative impact on public safety, Whitmer said.
The changes proposed by the bills include creating an autonomous process for setting side eligible misdemeanors and eligible non-assaultive felonies after 10 years.
The bills also expand the number and revises the types of felonies and misdemeanors eligible to be set aside by application.
They also treat multiple felonies or misdemeanor offenses arising from the same transaction as a single felony or misdemeanor conviction, provided the offenses happened within 24 hours of one another and are not assaultive crimes, or involves possession or use of a dangerous weapon, or is a crime that carries penalty of 10 or more years in prison.
Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist said the move is a step in the right direction, but said there is still work to do in reforming Michigan's criminal justice system.
""We must continue to do the work that needs to be done around criminal justice reform,"" he said. ""Our administration has been committed to enacting these reforms since day one."""

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue for our state is rebuilding the economy, while not sacrificing health. Both can be and need to be rebuilt, quickly. I intend take active engagement in open discussion and negotiations that will support ways for businesses to reopen safely. I will also support the constitutional rights of the people of Michigan and trust that they will make the best decisions for themselves and their families and their community--I will support them by helping provide the education needed for them to make healthy and safe decisions.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
The critical differences are that the people I will serve can trust that I will do what I say I will do and I am a person who takes action. An elected office is a privilege and the State Representative office a 2-year job, not a seat to take up and collect taxpayer money. I understand business, having been a business owner for nearly 20 years, and I understand having much and having little. I understand what it takes to raise a family and make the sacrifices needed for others before myself. I believe to serve the people you must be able to relate and I have life experiences and relationships that will provide me a grounding as well as an understanding that you can only have through years. As a State Representative, I will work for the people of my district and the state of Michigan from day 1, and not only when it is time for re-election.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
The main accomplishments are that of being a business owner, mother and wife of 24 years. I have also worked in corporate America and many various industries, giving me an understanding and perspective you can't have without the experiences. I understand the value of hard work and even working harder and feeling like you are gaining little and then pushing and persevering through anyway. Plus, my work and accomplishments with nonprofits in fundraising, strategic planning and board governance sets me apart and is a great precursor to serving people in an elected office.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
First, our state government must extend trust to each other and to the residents and businesses in Michigan. They must be willing to come to the table and engage in any and all discussions needed that holds this trust to be true. The discussions and negotiations need to support the constitutional rights and liberties that provide education and encouragement to make safe and healthy decisions for families, businesses and neighbors. Second, rather than an arbitrary plan, a very specific and measurable plan must be developed so people and businesses have the opportunity to self-govern and make the decisions how they WILL be able to open, and not wonder IF they ever will.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
The people in our community must feel safe in their homes, on the street, in their workplaces--wherever they go. The men and women in our police force must feel safe performing their duty and service to our community. We have the ability and opportunity to raise the bar in a way to support our public servants in blue AND provide equal justice to the people in our community. It does not need to be one or the other. I believe that setting higher standards and providing continual training and support in the areas of diversity and justice will go far in reforming our law and order system. It has been proven when the bar is raised, people will rise to it.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
My main focuses are on Health (physical & mental), Safety (justice & liberty) & Economy (workers & businesses). Plus, I believe that being trustworthy is in the actions I take and what I do when no one is looking and what I d when everyone is looking. Trust will always be my 'Job 1'.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I believe one's character speaks volumes to how they will act and serve in any capacity. I have spent years being the person my friends, co-workers and family could count on to say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done, not just what people 'wanted to hear' or see. We all might not agree and it certainly wasn't always easy. I am trusted that if I say I will do something, I will see it to the end. I am not only trusted, I understand what it means to be trustworthy and to tell the truth. These are guiding principles I apply to everything I do. We may not always agree, however I will be available, transparent and accountable to everyone I serve, no matter what. I will be open to listening to you, before, during and after any proposal, bill, legislation, or vote I do."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Mental Health many people are suffering from mild to severe trauma. Most of the time this is heavily influenced by societal pressures. We need broadscale mental health education for wellness and to promote peaceful dialogues in wide communities, as well as within many families. Fostering the development of more community groups which can bring in participatory sessions to relieve stress can change the attitudes of so many. This would include substance use discussions as well.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I've walked throughout District 3 several years encouraging people to get out and vote. We have to bring people who are systems thinkers in that can evaluate how our people are impacted by laws, policies and procedures. Having an eye toward how agencies are connected and how to handle issues brought forward by constituents matters to them and the greater community.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I started community organizing in 2011 with Occupy Detroit. Learned a lot of what not to do and listened to elders on how to improve. I've pulled legal standings to see how we could get petroleum coke removed from illegal dumping on the Detroit riverfront and we got that done, with an ordinance change following a few years later. I've guided people with questions and concerns how to navigate pathways to solutions with government agencies and service providers. As a State Representative I fully expect to be a conduit for the concerns of those I serve during sessions of the legislature.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
I know that within District 3 we have intense need for infrastructure work.
40% of the households in half of House District 3 are without internet access. Everything has gone digital and my people are stuck in a Digital Divide due to economic hardship and community division. This area also has longer times between buses and many don't have a vehicle.
Boost the economic recovery with wiring the people for achievement in the modern world. Then when we tout a website for information or app on the phone people can actually use it. Hold training sessions through community service groups. Increase grant funds available for addressing communities suffering from Digital Divide.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
Our police need more than Police Reform that comes from within. There has to be much more training on social injustices and perceptions. It is extremely dismissive for officers to refer to common people as perpetrators. Detroit Police implemented facial recognition technology without procedures and policies for over a year - this is an injustice that the civilian oversight board should have been calling out immediately. They claim it's newer technology... as a student at Wayne State University I know computer vision was being researched in 1980. The experiment on the people, paid for by the people, demonstrating its effectiveness and flaws to a GLOBAL audience is a sad statement on how distant and uncaring and underserving our society has become.
We need to be looking at various forms of reparations and that should include addressing the stock of homes in land banks giving them to families and individuals in need. Establish programs to elevate self sufficiency and bring about self worth and community worth as well.
Our children shouldn't have to walk into school as suspects being monitored. This simply shows our interest is higher on policing than mending our society.
Stop turning people incarcerated into a cash crop for investors in privatized prisons and their products. If we're working prisoners then they should be entitled to organize as well.

We've got housing stock that has gone derelict for far too long. Our homeless population continues to be at risk without solutions in a city of empty houses.

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
Health care and Prescription Drug Costs. I am a co-sponsor of legislation that would cap prescription drug costs in Michigan. We must continue to fight against high drug costs and limit the strain it puts on our citizens. In order to cover Michiganders to the fullest extent possible, we must prioritize our community health for this to become a reality. Everyone should have access to affordable health care in our state.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am the only candidate in this race that has put together an actual campaign. Unfortunately my Republican opponent has not given the voters an opportunity to know where she stands on issues or even to know that she is an actual candidate in the 12th District. I could not speak on our differences because I do not know what she stands for. I will say however, the difference is that I respect the voters' right to be informed about who is running to represent them in the legislature. I am proud of the positive campaign my team and I have run to inform the voters of my district.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have passed 5 bi-partisan bills during my first term as a State Representative. Making me a leader working on both sides of the aisle in the Michigan House of Representatives.

What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
During this period of COVID-19, the issues of our District have never been more apparent. Our immediate need is to continue to slow the spread of the Coronavirus and ensure our communities have the resources they need to respond to this pandemic. I am proud to have supported legislation that helped our small businesses access grants to help in their recovery. As I seek to return to Lansing, I will continue to be a strong advocate for supporting out local businesses rebuilding from this pandemic.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
We are at a boiling point in this country. We have seen so many racial injustices happen before our very eyes across this nation. Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, the list of injustices are almost endless. I have always been supported by our local law enforcement officials, and still am today. However, there are some bad actors that tarnish the badge and community that they swear an oath to protect. There is so much work to do in order to get reforms rolling in a positive direction. I am committed to continuing to work with our community and our law enforcement to make positive strides toward reform.

167,/michigan/detroit/whitmer-plot-could-affect-fight-battleground-michigan,2020-10-11T22:58:44Z,Whitmer Plot Could Affect Fight For...,1,20,Associated Press,News Partner,"From the Associated Press:
Gretchen Whitmer knew she'd have the spotlight Thursday. And she decided not to waste it.
Hours after the FBI revealed a group of anti-government vigilantes had plotted to kidnap her, the Democratic governor of Michigan addressed her state — and the nation — with a message that didn't mince words about whom she blamed for the threat: President Donald Trump was complicit for ""giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.""
It was a familiar move for a governor who has repeatedly engaged in heated public battles with the president that may only hurt him in a pivotal state against Democrat Joe Biden. While she risked politicizing the moment, the governor said Friday that she didn't think twice about calling out the president.
""I am raising two daughters who I want to be bold, too, you know, and to speak truth to power,"" Whitmer said in an Associated Press interview.
Whitmer's speech had the expected impact. Rather than express concern for her safety or health, Trump said she had ""done a terrible job as governor"" and ""rather than say thank you, she calls me a white supremacist,"" reminding voters in the state of the president's defense of far-right groups.
Some Republicans on Friday worried Trump's reaction would hurt him in a state he's trying desperately to win on Nov. 3. And Michigan Republicans critical of Trump expressed disbelief at state GOP leaders' failure to call out, or even mildly chide, Trump.
""I'm astounded in the last 24 hours no new Republican has come out and renounced Trump's rhetoric,"" said Jeff Timmer, a onetime Republican strategist who has distanced himself from the party since Trump's election. ""Nobody has dared stick their head out.""
After issuing a statement Thursday offering ""thoughts and prayers"" to the governor and her family, GOP Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey attended a demonstration to advocate for lifting Whitmer's restrictions on state businesses.
Whitmer's remarks were aimed at appealing to Michigan Republicans unhappy with the state of their party. She quoted President Ronald Reagan's 1981 address to the NAACP in which he condemned Americans ""who still hold perverted notions about what America is all about.""
Whitmer said Friday she pulled the quote to highlight that ""being a good American leader isn't a partisan thing. It's about recognizing that there's no room for hate and prejudice and violence in America. ... And every one of us should stand against that.""
As a former Senate minority leader and lead negotiator for Democrats under Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, Whitmer ""is not going to shy away from a fight,"" said John Anzalone, a pollster and senior aide during her 2018 campaign for governor. ""That's a big part of her personality.""
Fighting back has been good politics for the governor.
Whitmer's approval rating has been running well ahead of Trump's in the state. A majority in Michigan approve of her performance, a measure that has increased steadily with her handling of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Trump's has been stuck well under 50%, while his campaign has signaled worry about carrying the state a second time, campaign aides have said privately.
Trump won Michigan by less than a percentage point in 2016, and must win it again, along with Wisconsin or Pennsylvania and every other state he carried then, to get the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to win reelection.
Trump is facing strong headwinds in Oakland County, once the GOP stronghold and childhood home of mainstream Republicans such as Mitt Romney. But the flow of younger, more racially diverse families into the county has changed its political complexion. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the county, an upscale suburb neighboring Detroit to the northwest.
Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, a fellow Michigander, said through a spokesman that the president's response was appropriate, and added: ""Why isn't anyone asking Gov. Whitmer if her baseless attack on the president was appropriate?""
Whitmer put major restrictions on personal movement and the economy to stop the spread of the virus, though many of those limits have been lifted since spring. The governor has exchanged barbs with Trump on social media, with the president declaring in April, ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!""
Opponents of Whitmer's orders demonstrated at the Michigan Capitol the following month, some of them armed with semiautomatic assault rifles. However, there was no indication in the criminal complaint that the men in the kidnapping plot were inspired by Trump.
Authorities also have not publicly said whether the men were angry about Whitmer's coronavirus orders.
Last week in a debate with Biden, Trump did not clearly denounce white supremacist groups and instead told one right-wing group, the Proud Boys, who are active throughout Michigan: ""Stand back and stand by.""
Michigan Republican John Sellek, who ran Romney's 2012 Michigan campaign, said soft Republicans looking for a final reason to support Biden are finding one in Trump's response to Whitmer.
""Just as in the first debate, what the president could have done when he was asked, he could have clearly put down white supremacists,"" Sellek said. ""And he clearly didn't do it.""

168,/michigan/detroit/peters-james-clash-health-care-racial-justice-high-spending-high-stakes-senate-race,2020-10-26T02:27:25Z,"Peters, James Clash On Health Care, Racial...",0,0,Michigan Advance,News Partner,"As Election Day approaches, Michigan's U.S. Senate race has become one of the most closely watched in the nation, as it could be the key to which party controls the body in January.
The battle between U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and GOP nominee John James also has shattered fundraising records, as total spending could top $100 million. But in an interesting twist, many of the candidates' ads don't mention their party.
Health care has emerged as a key issue in the race — specifically the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and whether pre-existing conditions coverage will remain protected, as they are in the seminal legislation quarterbacked by the Obama administration. More than 4 million Michiganders have pre-existing conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer.
During an interview with WDIV-TV in Detroit that aired on Oct. 18, James did not answer the question posed by host Devin Scillian about whether he had a plan to fix or replace ACA.
""So, so, here's the thing,"" said James, who appeared to be caught off guard by the question. ""I'm not a politician.""
James favors repealing the ACA, but he has run ads saying he supports keeping protections for pre-existing conditions, noting his son has asthma, without saying how. There's currently a case before the U.S. Supreme Court backed by the President Trump administration that would overturn the law.
On the same broadcast, but in a separate interview, Peters, who voted for the ACA as a congressman, said he continues to support the law and wants to ""expand the access but deal with the [prescription] cost."" Peters backs legislation allowing those 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare.
""Make sure that we're fixing what's not working right and celebrate what works,"" Peters said.
One way to do that, Peters said, is to allow the Medicare system to negotiate price with pharmaceutical firms.
Peters has a 5 percentage point lead, 48.6% to 43.4%, over James, according to the conservative Real Clear Politics site.
That's closer than the race for president in Michigan, where Democratic nominee Joe Biden holds a 7.5-point lead over President Donald Trump.
National handicappers like the Cook Report classify the Michigan Senate seat as ""Lean Democrat"" and FiveThirtyEight gives Peters a 79 in 100 shot of being reelected.
Republicans currently hold a 53-47 voting advantage over Democrats in the U.S. Senate. While the GOP is playing defense in big races in Colorado, Iowa, Maine, North Carolina and more, Michigan and Alabama may hold the strongest promise for Republicans to flip seats and keep the majority.
This isn't James' first rodeo. Two years ago, the Farmington Hills businessman sought to unseat U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing). Stabenow, a three-term incumbent, defeated him 52% to 46%.
However, the closer-than-expected result gave Republicans hope that he could knock Peters off this year.
The nonprofit Michigan Campaign Finance Network (MCFN) projects the total cost of the 2020 race will exceed $100 million this election cycle — shattering the record for a Senate seat in Michigan — based on a compilation of Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, ad tracking data from Advertising Analytics and Facebook disclosures. The Peters and James campaigns plan to spend more than $35 million on broadcast advertising.
The 2018 race between James Stabenow was about $40 million.
MCFN has identified more than 40 outside groups that have collectively spent at least $50 million thus far in the race, according to a combination of Federal Election Commission and Advertising Analytics spending data that encompasses spending beyond advertising.
""Most of the outside money has been spent on advertising, but for the groups that do report their spending, the ways they can act like a shadow campaign become apparent,"" MCFN wrote in its analysis. ""Nearly $8 million has been spent attacking Peters and $2.5 million attacking James, all by outside groups.""
Peters has raised a total of $43 million through Oct. 15, per the FEC. He has $3.9 million left in the bank. James collected a total of $33.9 million and has $8.8 million cash on hand.
Peters and James, who are both veterans, will not have a formal debate because the candidates could not agree on terms. But they did participate in separate interviews for both WDIV this month and an event sponsored by the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce in September.
In the 2018 election, James noted his ""2,000%"" support for Trump. He appeared with Trump at a December 2019 rally in Battle Creek, but this time around, James rarely mentions the president. He skipped Trump's Muskegon rally on Saturday.
""This race is not about the president,"" the Detroit News reported James said in May. He later added, ""This race is about Michigan.""
For this campaign, James has been stressing his business credentials and often doesn't mention that he's a Republican in ads.
""Building on Opportunity Zones in the administration's landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 there should be full support of Senator Tim Scott's [R-S.C.] proposal to let state and local governments use the census tract to change opportunity zones to help those in need,"" James' website reads.
Meanwhile, Peters' campaign has focused on presenting him as a bipartisan lawmaker focused on results. His campaign website doesn't mention that he is a Democrat; nor do many of his TV ads.
In September, the Peters campaign issued a press release touting that he had been endorsed by Sterling Heights Mayor Michael Taylor, a Republican who voted for James in 2018.
This week, Peters has released a TV ad that does feature popular Democratic former President Obama, who said Peters ""had my back"" when he was in office.
James' campaign did not respond to a request for an interview. Andrew ""Rocky"" Raczkowski, a former state lawmaker and Oakland County Republican Party chair, believes that James best represents the values of his home county.
""I think James is outperforming all the candidates in Oakland County,"" said Raczkowski who challenged Peters for the U.S. House seat in a heated campaign in 2010. ""He's the man who will fight for us.""
Peters spokesperson Vanessa Valdivia called Peters an ""effective, bipartisan leader"" and said James has offered ""false attacks, empty rhetoric and no solutions.""
""He's [Peters] focused on issues that matter to working families across the state — like health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions, expanding opportunities for skills training and defending our Great Lakes.""
If elected, James would be the second Black Republican to join the Senate, along with Scott.
He also would achieve something that neither longtime Michigan Secretary of State Richard Austin, a Democrat, nor Keith Butler, a Republican, could and become Michigan's first Black U.S. senator. Neither even secured their party's nomination in 1976 and 2006, respectively.
At the Detroit chamber forum, James said that America was on the brink of civil war.
""I recognize that this country, looking at some stats, if you look at one to 100, with 100 being close to a civil war … we're almost three-quarters of the way there,"" James said. ""I think that having leadership who is used to having nonpartisan solutions both in the military and in business, being raised by two Democrats in the Jim Crow South, being an independent thinker, not owned by any party, or process, I think that that's the best way to go.""
James has portrayed himself as a ""unifier"" in his ads, including one after George Floyd, an African American man, was killed at the hands of Minneapolis police in May. James described the act as ""a cowardly act of evil"" but also denounced rioters as ""criminal."" A recent study found that 97% of Michigan Black Lives Matter protests were peaceful.
On the issue of police reform, James has called for increased police funding, more officer training, implementing community policing and hiring more officers from communities where they serve as opposed to defunding police as some activists have advocated.
Earlier this year, Scott sponsored legislation that stopped short of banning chokeholds and establishing independent review into police-involved use of deadly force. James lifted up the Scott legislation at the Detroit Chamber forum. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NAACP, National Action Network, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO, League of Women Voters and National Education Association opposed the bill.
Peters criticized Senate Republicans for not passing what he characterized as meaningful reforms. He has called for more transparency and accountability for officers and police departments, including a way to keep track of officers who act improperly so they can't move from department to department. In addition, Peters supports government creating incentives for those who join law enforcement in their communities or those who choose to live in the communities they police.
""This is a moment that demands working together to craft legislation that takes effective action, has broad bipartisan support and can overwhelmingly pass the Senate — and I remain committed to partnering on such an effort,"" Peters said at the time.
Peters, who is white, boasts some significant support in the African-American community, a key Democratic Party constituency. Peters has earned the support of key Black clergy, including the Rev. Steve Bland Jr.; president of the influential Council of Baptist Pastors, Detroit and Vicinity; the Rev. Wendell Anthony, pastor of the Fellowship Chapel and president of the nonpartisan Detroit Branch NAACP; and the Rev. QuanTez Pressley, a millennial who is pastor of Third New Hope Baptist Church.
Peters also has been endorsed by the Michigan Chronicle, the state's largest Black newspaper founded in 1936. It has endorsed both hundreds of labor-backed candidates, as well as Republicans like former Govs. John Engler and Rick Snyder, and described its decision for Senate as ""not even close.""
""In this moment of the Black Lives Movement, racial reckoning and demands for social justice, James' bizarre ambivalence about Black civil rights – even refusing to support the strengthening and renewal of the John Lewis Voting Rights Restoration Act and denying voter suppression is profoundly problematic,"" its editorial read. ""It puts him squarely at odds both morally and politically, with most African Americans on an issue that is foundational to the Black community.""
Stabenow told the Advance that Peters better supports issues of importance to African Americans, such as disparities in health care, criminal justice and business development.
""There's a huge difference,"" Stabenow said. ""I don't see John James speaking out on those issues.""
The COVID-19 pandemic also has loomed large in the campaign. James has accused Peters of ignoring coronavirus early on. Peters, however, in March voted to support the bipartisan $2.2 trillion CARES Act that funded relief to individuals, schools and businesses.
Peters has urged the GOP-led Senate ""to stop dragging their feet"" and approve another stimulus known as the $3 trillion HEROES Act that the Democrat-led U.S. House approved in May. Negotiations between the White House, Democratic House and GOP Senate have been at a stalemate for months.
Laura Cox, Michigan Republican Party chair, ripped Peters on Thursday for his no vote on a GOP-sponsored $500 billion coronavirus relief bill in the Senate. Senate Democrats argued that the measure did not provide enough help.
""Gary Peters was sent to Washington by Michigan families to stand up for them and nothing else,"" Cox said in a statement. ""Because of the havoc created by COVID-19, Michigan families needed Peters today more than ever, but he let them down – serving Democrat leadership over families in need. Because of Gary Peters, bills will go unpaid, medicine will not be purchased, and schools will go without necessary funding. Though he will still receive two government paychecks and exclusive health care. If Peters was known for nothing before today, that certainly will change going forward.""
The Supreme Court has emerged as a late issue in the campaign, as Trump has nominated conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy created by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Democratic activists argue that another Trump pick to the nation's high court will further erode the Voting Rights Act and deliver a blow to women's reproductive rights by striking down Roe v. Wade.
Peters does not believe the Senate should take up a nomination until after a new presidential term begins in January.
James tweeted in September that he believes that Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump's nominee, is ""an accomplished and well-respected legal mind with an objectively brilliant career. I wish her a respectful and dignified hearing.""
Disclosure: Ken Coleman worked for Peters as press secretary in 2012."
169,/michigan/detroit/can-democrats-win-back-michigan-house-after-decade,2020-10-26T02:22:59Z,Can Democrats Win Back The Michigan House After...,0,0,Michigan Advance,News Partner,"During a presidential election year, most of the attention is on the top of the ticket and top-tier congressional races. But control of Michigan's House of Representatives is also at stake on Nov. 3.
Republicans currently hold a 58-51 voting advantage and have targeted several Democratic districts in areas where President Donald Trump is popular. One seat is vacant, which was held by the late Rep. Isaac Robinson, a Detroit Democrat who died of a suspected COVID-19 infection in March.
On Tuesday, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson noted that more than 1.5 million absentee ballots had already been cast. Dennis Darnoi, a Republican consultant who tracks voter data, said the Republican House candidates throughout the state will be helped by Trump's visit to Lansing on Tuesday and he expects other GOP surrogate campaign stops by both parties leading up to Election Day. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has made several visits to Michigan and his vice presidential nominee U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), is scheduled to visit Detroit on Sunday.
Darnoi believes that more Republicans than Democrats will cast their ballot in person on Nov. 3.
""I think Republicans are doing what they need to do, albeit late, to make sure that their voters turn out,"" he said. ""These races will be really, really tight.""
If Democrats can flip at least four seats — something they're hopeful will happen if Biden wins Michigan — they would appear to take control of the chamber for the first time in a decade. The GOP flipped the House during the 2010 red tide that swept Rick Snyder in as governor.
Swing Left is a national progressive grassroots nonprofit that is working to get Democrats elected across the nation. It has raised almost $200,000 for Michigan House candidates.
""This is one of the Democratic Party's best chances to take back the House in some time,"" said Ryan Quinn, Swing Left political director.
Democrats are aiming for five seats, as they can't count on the vote for speaker of state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit,) who is virtually a shoe-in to be reelected in a deep blue seat. Whitsett has been silent on the question. She has battled with members of her caucus, joined Republicans in a slapdown of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's powers to address the COVID-19 crisis, and has been reprimanded by her local party organization after publicly thanking GOP President Donald Trump during her bout with COVID-19.
A tie has happened in recent Michigan history. After both parties ended up with 55 members following the 1992 election, the caucuses agreed to have a power-sharing arrangement for the 1993-94 term that included having co-House speakers, Democrat Curtis Hertel Sr. of Detroit and Paul Hillegonds of Holland.
The Senate is not up for election this year; members' four-year terms expire in 2022. Republicans, who have a 22-16 member advantage, have controlled that body since 1984.
So even if Democrats do seize control of the House, Senate Republicans likely will still be able to block Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's agenda if they want.
Oakland County — a wealthy metro Detroit fiefdom that used to be a GOP stronghold — is expected to play a key role in the 2020 election from president to control of the state House.
""The path to the majority goes through Oakland County,"" said state Rep. Donna Lasinski (D-Scio Twp.) House Democratic caucus campaign chair.
Democrats are running a slate of women, many of whom have been significantly outraised their GOP counterparts. But the House GOP caucus has been filling in gaps with contributions to Republicans, state campaign finance reports show.
Democrats are targeting working families and college-educated voters who have voted Republican in the past, but don't support the right-wing policies and rhetoric offered by the Trump administration and GOP leaders in the state House and Senate.
Two years ago, state Rep. Mari Manoogian (D-Birmingham) flipped the open 40th District, a long-held Oakland County seat.
""Folks who have traditionally voted Republican no longer identify with the current version of the Republican Party,"" Manoogian told the Advance this summer.
Oakland County Republican Party Chair Andrew ""Rocky"" Raczkowski, who served in the state House between 1997 and 2003 and was majority floor leader, believes that all of the Oakland County House races will be ""competitive."" But he told the Advance he has a good feeling about the slate of GOP candidates in his backyard.
A bellwether for both parties might be in the open 45th House District, which includes Rochester and Rochester Hills, and is held by term-limited Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills). The race features Democrat Barbara Anness, a Rochester Community Schools Board of Education trustee, and Mark Tisdel, a Republican who serves on the Rochester Hills City Council.
Big-name endorsements have been a trend this year, especially as national Democrats have been paying more attention to state legislative races. Both Biden and Harris had endorsed Anness. Former U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Rochester Hills) backs Tisdel, as does GOP Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard.
Darnoi believes the race is one to watch, but Republicans will hang on and win it.
""I know that suburban women are leaving the Republican Party, but I just think at a local level the 45th is going to be a very, very contested seat,"" said Darnoi, who worked for Bishop when he represented the area in the Senate. ""It's just hard for me to see it go [Democratic.]""
There are several high-spending races in Oakland County where Democrats are optimistic.
First-term Rep. Ryan Berman (R-Commerce Twp.) won the 39th District seat in 2018 against disgraced Democrat Jennifer Suidan, who later received probation for embezzling campaign funds. Berman has notched a conservative record, backing the effort to impeach Whitmer over her COVID-19 orders and opposing federal aid for coronavirus.
This time around, he faces Democrat Julia Pulver, a former emergency room nurse with a national profile for her abortion rights commentary who ran for Senate in 2018.
Raczkowski said he believes Berman will hold the district because he ""has done an incredible job connecting with the people of West Bloomfield and Commerce. He comes from that district. He was born and raised in that district. He attends synagogue in that district.""
The 38th House District, which includes Novi, South Lyon, Lyon Township and Walled Lake, is open. Democrat Kelly Breen, who lost the district in 2018 to now-term-limited Rep. Kathy Crawford (R-Novi) faces Republican Chase Turner, who worked as a field director for 2018 GOP congressional nominee Lena Epstein, who lost to now-U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Rochester).
Turner is running on a ""change"" platform, despite the fact that Republicans control the House. Raczkowski said he ""was born and raised in that district and he understands the people of Novi, South Lyon and Wixon very well.""
Rep. Andrea Schroeder (R-Independence Twp.) also is trying to stave off a challenge in the traditionally red 43rd House District from Democrat Nicole Breadon.
Democrats want to hang on to the 27th House District, which includes Berkley, Ferndale, Hazel Park, Huntington Woods, Oak Park, Pleasant Ridge and Royal Oak Township and is held by term-limited state Rep. Robert Wittenberg (D-Huntington Woods). It's a matchup between Democrat Regina Weiss and Republican Elizabeth Goss.
They also want to maintain the 37th House District, which includes Farmington and Farmington Hills and is held by term-limited House Minority Leader Christine Greig (D-Farmington Hills). In that race, Democrat Samantha Steckloff, the daughter of Farmington Hills Mayor Vicki Barnett, is running against Republican Mitch Swoboda.
Republicans aren't just playing defense. They have several seats in metro Detroit, greater Lansing and Bay County that they're hopeful of flipping.
That includes the 19th House District in suburban Wayne County that's held by first-term Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia). Republicans have nominated Livonia school teacher Martha Ptashnik.
In the 19th District, which covers the Northville, Plymouth and Canton Township in Wayne County, freshman Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) is being challenged by John Lacny, a Marine veteran and retired supply chain manager.
Freshman Rep. Angela Witwer (D-Delta Twp.) represents a 71st District seat in Eaton County outside Lansing that both parties have won in the last decade. Republican Gina Johnsen is trying to take it back.
State Rep. Brian Elder (D-Bay City) wants to win his third and last term in the 96th District, but Republicans are hoping Trump's record of stealing votes in the Saginaw-Genesee-Bay region will lift GOP nominee Timothy Beson.
Another seat some Republicans had thought they could flip on the strength of Trump's 2016 performance was the 25th District in Macomb County, currently represented by freshman Rep. Nate Shannon (D-Sterling Heights). However, Republican officials have sought to distance themselves from nominee Paul Smith, who this month defended those arrested in the right-wing terrorist plot to assassinate Whitmer.
""What a totally bogus sham,"" Smith said on Facebook, as reported by the Detroit News. ""These citizens never did anything illegal. Law enforcement is employed to punish people who COMMIT crimes, not people The Governess simply HATES. You can legally hurt Whitmer by voting out her minions.""
Smith has run for office several times and his far-right views are well-known. Deadline Detroit reported that the Secret Service once questioned Smith for ""carrying a protest sign featuring an illustration of [then-President Barack] Obama impaled through the skull by a spear"" in 2009. Smith also held similarly violent signs about former Gov. Jennifer Granholm and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
Meanwhile, Democrats have their own targets in the Traverse City area, which has trended blue, and West Michigan, where U.S. Rep. Fred Upton (R-St. Joseph), Michigan's longest-serving legislator on Capitol Hill, is facing a strong challenge from state Rep. Jon Hoadley (D-Kalamazoo) in the 6th Congressional District. That may hurt down-ballot GOP candidates.
With embattled Rep. Larry Inman (R-Williamsburg) term-limited in the 104th District in northern Michigan, Dems hope Dan O'Neil, who also ran in 2018, can defeat Republican John Roth.
The 61st House seat in Kalamazoo County is open with state Rep. Brandt Iden (R-Oshtemo Twp.) term-limited. Democrat Christine Morse is matched up against Republican Bronwyn Haltom.
There's also the 66th District on the west side of the state. Rep. Beth Griffin (R-Mattawan) is defending her Berrien County seat against Democrat Abigail Wheeler.
There's always the possibility of a few surprises on Election Day. Republicans have made some noise about knocking off first-term Rep. Sheryl Kennedy (D-Davison) with Republican David Martin. Freshman Rep. Pauline Wendzel (R-Watervliet) is facing a spirited challenge from 21-year-old Chokwe Pitchford."

""No Michigander should have to worry about going into work when they're sick, especially during a global pandemic,"" Whitmer said. ""These bipartisan bills ensure crucial protections for our workers and businesses who do their part to protect our families and frontline workers from the spread of COVID-19.

The bills the governor signed Thursday require employers to allow workers who are exposed to COVID-19 or exhibit the symptoms of COVID-19 to stay home, and prohibit retaliation against employees for staying home when sick or exposed to the virus. The bills also provide a minimum damages award of $5,000 for violations. The damages may be higher than that in the event of more serious conduct or injuries.
House Bills 6030-6032 protect Michigan businesses that comply with relevant COVID-19-related laws, including epidemic orders and rules. HB 6030 makes clear that when a business complies with all relevant COVID-19 related statutes, orders, and rules issued by federal, state, and local authorities, they cannot be held liable for a person becoming sick at the business, the governor's office said in a news release.
HB 6031 makes clear that when an employer complies with all relevant COVID-19 related statutes, orders, and rules issued by federal, state, and local authorities, they also cannot be held liable under the Michigan Occupational Health and Safety Act for a worker becoming sick at work."

The single most pressing issue facing our state is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
COVID-19. As a parent of two elementary students, I truly want my children back face-to-face. Yet I believe we need to follow science and data and ensure safety protocols put forth by our district follow federal, state and local guidelines. The safety and wellbeing of our students and staff is number one. The board recently approved a hybrid plan and it's a good start. There are students who are thriving in the current model and there are also students and parents who are significantly struggling with remote learning. We need to ensure our students and parents have the support in place to ensure success. It is important to engage the community, students, and staff for their input within the decision-making process as well. All stakeholders voices need to be heard throughout the process to make well informed decisions that support our students.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I'm a proud Plymouth resident, born and raised in Canton, and a mother of two elementary students starting their educational experiences at Smith Elementary. I am a P-CCS alumna. We need diversity on our board and we're missing representation for working families with young children. I hope to fill that void.
I am a professional Interior Designer specializing in educational facilities. At my previous employer, I had the joy and honor to work with P-CCS on the 2013 bond, where we built Liberty Middle School, created safe and secure entrances, and enhanced learning environments including STEM additions and technology upgrades throughout the district. I actively work with school boards, administrators, educators, students, and parents in school districts across Michigan and Ohio. My expertise is in transforming interior spaces into modern learning environments that support curriculum and now I'm helping districts transform facilities to navigate our evolving health crisis.
I also proudly serve on the leadership team of our local Moms Demand Action chapter, supporting our community and advocating for gun sense legislation.
I am running because I know the value of a P-CCS education and want to represent my district and community to ensure all students have the best educational experience and opportunities available.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
As an educational interior designer, I work with multiple stakeholders with differing viewpoints on projects daily. Designers are problem solvers. I work with school boards, administrators, students, parents, and staff of school districts throughout Michigan and Ohio. My ability to listen, research, collaborate, communicate, and think on my feet will serve well on the board. I plan to work hard and collaborate with fellow board members and superintendent to make informed decisions for our students.
What steps should state government take to bolster economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic for local businesses?
I believe citizens need to do their part to wear masks, wash their hands, and physically distance to weather this storm. We are better when we work together.
How will you address the calls for racial justice and police reform?
We need to continue our diversity, equity, and inclusion work at P-CCS. We need ongoing professional development of our teachers and staff to include diversity, equity, and inclusion training. Support services need to be in place to shrink the achievement gaps, which greatly affect our minority populations at P-CCS. Our curriculum should reflect the diversity of our students and be woven throughout the curriculum, not just highlighted during a small portion of the school year. Our teaching staff should also reflect the diversity of our community. We need to continue improve our restorative justice practices to address misconduct that focuses on healing rather than punishment and values accountability over exclusion. These initiatives collectively can help create safe and inclusive environments for our students.
List other issues that define your campaign platform:
As a board member and parent my priorities include:
• Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Education is the lifeline of a community and I will ensure every student has opportunities to succeed. I believe this can be accomplished through policy, continued professional development of P-CCS faculty and staff, improved support services for students, and creating a more inclusive curriculum.
• Excellence through measurable goals to recruit and retain quality educators.
• Better school safety through COVID precautions, promoting connections between students and staff, building upon restorative practices, and providing support services for students in need.
• Community input. We all should feel represented and take pride in our schools and my transparent communication will bring more seats to the table.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I want to call our community to action. Please remember to research your school board candidates and support those who truly want to make education and our community a top priority. Additionally, I would like to urge our community to support the Wayne County RESA millage on our November 3rd ballot. This is a significant funding source that will bring resources directly to our students."
172,/michigan/detroit/whitmer-signs-bill-extending-unemployment-through-end-year,2020-10-20T21:59:35Z,Whitmer Signs Bill Extending Unemployment...,0,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"MICHIGAN — Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday signed Senate Bills 886 and 991, codifying part of her executive orders expanding unemployment benefits to Michiganders.
The bills the governor signed Tuesday will extend unemployment benefits for Michiganders who have lost work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic from 20 to 26 weeks until the end of the year.
""No Michigander should have to worry about how to put food on the table or pay their bills, especially during a global pandemic,"" Whitmer said. ""These bipartisan bills are an important step in providing immediate relief for working families, but given the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Michigan, I urge the legislature to take further action to make this permanent. 40 states, including all of our neighbors, automatically provide at least 26 weeks of unemployment relief. Michiganders deserve better than a short-term extension that expires at the end of the year. It's time to work together on a long-term solution for working families.""
The bills were passed originally by legislators during the night of Oct. 13-14, as well as a series of others, many of which mirror executive orders issued by Whitmer amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Those orders, however, were deemed null when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the law Whitmer cited in issuing executive orders was unconstitutional.
Last week, the court reaffirmed its decision by not extending Whitmer's previously issued orders to Oct. 30.
Since the court's initial ruling, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon on has issued emergency orders mirroring orders issued by Whitmer. One issued last week restricts gathering sizes and requires face coverings in pubic spaces.
Gordon's order comes under a legal authority enacted by the Michigan Legislature after the Spanish Flu of 1918 specifically to deal with epidemics, according to a news release. That statute was not at issue in the Supreme Court's ruling, officials said.
Local municipalities, such as Detroit, Wayne and Oakland counties, have also issued localized orders requiring similar measures."
173,/michigan/detroit/duggan-nearly-300-affordable-housing-units-coming-detroit,2020-10-20T12:06:22Z,Duggan: Nearly 300 Affordable Housing Units...,0,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"DETROIT, MI — Nearly 300 affordable housing units will be built or preserved in Detroit after the state approved five projects, the city announced this week.
The five projects will create or preserve 282 units of affordable housing in the city for residents earning as little as $16,500 per year and up to $44,000 per year, the city said in a news release.
With the inclusion of the previously awarded and future phases of one of the five projects, this brings to 396 the total number of affordable units being created by the developments, according to a news release. Three of the projects will be new construction, creating 271 new units of affordable housing. Two others will renovate a total of 125 units in existing buildings while preserving their affordability for at least the next 30 years.
Together, the five projects represent a $122.9 million investment in Detroit, the city said.
""We've made a serious commitment to our longtime residents that they will not be pushed out of their homes as our city redevelops, and that there will be housing options for people of all income levels, even in some of the city's hottest neighborhoods,"" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said. ""I am deeply grateful to our partners and HUD and MSHDA for their confidence in our housing strategy and their support for these important projects.""
The largest of the five projects to be awarded the tax credits is Brush Watson in the historic Brush Park neighborhood immediately north of City Modern, the city said. The LIHTC award announced Monday makes a second phase of the project – with 49 affordable units – possible, bringing the number of new units of affordable housing on the site to 163.
The previously approved first phase had already planned to add 60 units, with 48 affordable. The mixed-use, mixed-income project will now feature three buildings that will encompass an entire city block and include approximately 8,000 square feet of commercial space along Brush Street. There also will be underground parking for residents. The project represents a total investment of $65 million.
Of the total 310 units, 90 will be reserved for residents earning incomes starting about $16,000 to $28,000 a year. Rents for these units will start around $400 a month. Another 70 units will be reserved for residents earning about $42,000 per year at a rent around $1,000 a month. Rental assistance will be available for some units.
Detroit-based American Community Developers Inc. (ACD) is developing the project with partner Dr. Irvin Reid, former president of Wayne State University.
""We are proud to be creating more quality housing for Detroiters in one of the city's fastest-growing neighborhoods,"" said Jerry Krueger, president of ACD. ""Our goal is to build housing that is both high quality and affordable. We want to thank the City and our partners for believing in this project, one we think will make all Detroiters proud.""
Jim Holley Residences
Named after the church's longtime leader, all 60 units at the Jim Holley Residences will be affordable, and the new-construction building will feature 5,000 square feet of commercial space. Work on the $17.8 million project at 9001 Woodward Ave. is expected to begin in the spring and take 14 to 15 months to complete. The City of Detroit is supporting the project with a $2 million HOME award. MHT Housing of Bingham Farms is serving as the developer. Total investment: $17.8 million.
""The Rev. Jim Holley Senior Residences is a manifestation of our commitment to the North End and the city of Detroit,"" said Rev. Holley. ""The North End has become a livable place because Little Rock led the vision and made it possible for others to believe again that the city can be a place to grow up and grow old.""
Left Field at former Tiger Stadium
The other new-construction project receiving LIHTC funding this round will create housing on what was once left field of Tiger Stadium in Corktown, at the Fisher Freeway service drive and Cochrane Street. ACD is developing Left Field, and the first phase includes 60 units, 48 of which are set aside as affordable housing ranging from 30 to 80 percent AMI, with rental assistance available for some of the units. Work is expected to begin next summer. Total investment: $15 million.
Midtown Square
Located at 93 Seward in New Center, Midtown Square is a historic apartment building originally constructed in the late 1920s. The redevelopment is being performed by John Stanley and Develop Detroit. All 73 of its units will remain affordable. Total investment: $18.5 million.
Friendship Meadows II
This senior-housing complex at 1003 Leland St. was built in the early 2000s and provides much-needed low-income housing in Detroit's Forest Park neighborhood. The redevelopment will be conducted by Robert Beale. Its 52 affordable units will remain 100 percent affordable. Total investment: $6.6 million.
LIHTC is a federal program administered in Michigan by MSHDA that helps fund the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing for households between 30 percent and 80 percent of the area median income (AMI), as determined by HUD. Rents at LIHTC properties are limited based on the AMI ensuring eligible households have quality units to call home at an affordable price.
""MSHDA is pleased to partner with the City of Detroit and the various development companies on these much-needed affordable housing projects,"" Chad Benson, MSHDA acting director of development. ""The five unique developments will further our goal of producing and preserving good quality affordable apartments for individuals, families, and seniors with low and moderate incomes, while helping support the city's social and economic development goals.""
The City of Detroit's Housing & Revitalization Department subsidized all of the new construction projects and assisted in a variety of other ways, such as the facilitation of permitting that is necessary for LIHTC application submissions. Through its ongoing efforts to build and protect affordable housing in Detroit, the department has either helped create or preserve 785 units this year alone, and work started this year on an additional 80.
""I would like to thank MSHDA and our development partners for their commitments to creating and preserving affordable housing in Detroit,"" said Donald Rencher, director of the Housing & Revitalization Department. ""Our department is dedicated to ensuring that development in our city creates equity and opportunity and that our city's neighborhoods are welcoming, inclusive places for all."""

As state voters continue to cast ballots early and Election Day just three days away, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has raised concerns about voter suppression efforts. She urges anyone who encounters election-related misinformation to report it, so her department can investigate.
Michigan residents can go to the ""Misinformation and False Information"" section of the Secretary of State website or email misinformation@michigan.gov.
The Michigan Advance reported Thursday that right-wing operatives and conspiracy theorists Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, each facing several felony charges for spreading misinformation and attempting to intimidate Michigan voters via robocalls, have been ordered by a federal court to correct those falsehoods with another robocall.
The operatives allegedly orchestrated a robocall on Aug. 26 designed to intimidate voters, particularly those in areas with large minority populations, out of voting with mail-in ballots. Attorney General Dana Nessel filed charges against Burkman and Wohl on Oct. 1 for the attempt to suppress voter turnout.
In an interview with the Advance this week, Benson encouraged residents who have received an absentee ballot by mail to return it in person, if possible.
""I would go to my city or township clerk's office, or a satellite office in a city like Detroit and pick up a ballot, fill it out, and return it right there so that it's in and on time and done on one trip,"" Benson said.
She also pointed out that an absentee ballot must be returned to the city or township in which it was requested in order for it to be valid. That means, for example, a Flint resident who requested an absentee ballot cannot return it in Detroit, Lansing, Traverse City or Grand Rapids.
""We are too close to Election Day, and the right to vote is too important, to rely on the postal service to deliver absentee ballots on time,"" Benson said.
More than 3.25 million Michigan residents have requested absentee ballots and 2.6 million have returned their ballots as of Friday.
Benson pointed out that beginning on Election Day, a ""vast amount of data"" will have been received and need to be processed and that complete statewide election results may not be available until Friday, three days after Election Day.
""It may take 80 hours to tabulate 3.2 million ballots. That's what the math shows, so we're estimating Friday [for statewide results],"" Benson said.
She also noted cyber security is a concern. Benson said that the Department of State has increased security to protect its voter file and other aspects of the voting process. She has partnered with federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to better understand and circumvent potential threats.
""We've also implemented training for our local election officials,"" Benson said. She pointed out that she has hired the state's first director of election security.
As for her reaction to a Michigan Court of Claims judge on Tuesday striking down her directive banning the open carry of guns at polling places on Election Day, which was then upheld by the Court of Appeals, Benson reiterated her concerns.
""For me, the bottom line is that voter intimidation is illegal, under both state and federal law, and we will not tolerate it in Michigan. We will continue to prepare our law enforcement and poll workers to identify intimidation, threats or harassment that occurs and contact the Michigan State Police or other law enforcement to protect workers,"" Benson said.
Attorney General Dana Nessel said she is appealing to the Michigan Supreme Court."

A U.S. district court judge in Washington has ordered the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to speed up the delivery of ballots in the agency's Detroit district ahead of Tuesday's general election.
The order comes just days after a U.S. House investigation found that USPS mail delivery timeliness in Detroit has declined in the last several months, leading to some of the most significant mail delays in the nation.
For instance, the Advance reported this week that Detroit region delivery rates that stood at 93.7% in mid-February fell to just 71.6% by Oct. 10, according to data from the investigation.
Judge Stanley Bastian ordered the agency to accelerate service after a coalition of 13 plaintiff states held a status conference with USPS.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is part of the coalition, which filed a lawsuit against the USPS in August following mail service slowdowns.
The USPS will also be required to accelerate delivery in their Lakeland district in Wisconsin.
""The slowdown of mail delivery in our state – especially in Detroit – has had a dramatic negative impact on the timely delivery of absentee ballots,"" Nessel said in a news release about the order. ""This has been a serious impediment to voters who have made the effort to request, receive, vote and return their absentee ballots.""
Nessel called the order an important step, but only a temporary fix to an ""ongoing problem.""
The order applies to USPS facilities and processing centers in Detroit. It states:
Attorneys with Nessel's office will get ""reasonable access"" to USPS facilities for compliance purposes, according to the order.
Nessel also urged voters to check Michigan.gov/vote to make sure their ballots have been received.
If not, voters should go to their local election clerk's office on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday to cancel their absentee ballot so they can instead get a new ballot and vote in-person, she said.
""At this point, you should not use the mail to deliver your absentee ballot because, even with this order, we simply cannot be assured it will get through the mail on time to be counted,"" Nessel said. ""Every Michigan voter should ensure their voice is heard and their ballot counts. Drop off your absentee ballot in person or go to the polls on Nov. 3."""

DETROIT, MI — Calling Joe Biden his ""brother,"" Barack Obama on Saturday accused Donald Trump of failing to take the coronavirus pandemic and the presidency seriously as Democrats leaned on America's first Black president to energize Black voters in battleground Michigan on the final weekend of the 2020 campaign.
Obama, the 44th president, and Biden, his vice president who wants to be the 46th, held drive-in rallies in Flint and Detroit, predominantly Black cities where strong turnout will be essential to swing the longtime Democratic state to Biden's column after Trump won it in 2016.
""Three days until the most important election of our lifetime — and that includes mine, which was pretty important,"" said Obama, urging Democrats to get to the polls.
The memories of Trump's win in Michigan and the rest of the Upper Midwest are still searing in the minds of many Democrats during this closing stretch before Tuesday's election. That leaves Biden in the position of holding a consistent lead in the national polls and an advantage in most battlegrounds, including Michigan, yet still facing anxiety it could all slip away.
As of Saturday, nearly 92 million voters had already cast ballots nationwide, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Tens of millions more will vote by the time polls close on Tuesday night.
The former president hammered on Trump's continued focus on the size of his campaign crowds.
""Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?"" Obama said in a mocking tone. ""The country's going through a pandemic. That's not what you're supposed to be worrying about.""
Throughout the day, Trump and Biden, both septuagenarians, threw stinging barbs at one another that at moments verged into schoolyard taunt territory.
Speaking in Flint, Biden joked of Trump, ""When you were in high school, wouldn't you have liked to take a shot?"" He also mocked the president as a ""macho man.""
Trump, too, on Saturday suggested he could beat up Biden if given the chance and suggested the former vice president wears sunglasses to cover up ""surgery on the eyes.""
""He's not a big guy,"" Trump said of Biden. ""A slight slap, you wouldn't have to close your fist.""
Later in Detroit, Biden ridiculed Trump for calling himself a ""perfect specimen,"" called him Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""puppy,"" and joked about a New York Times report that showed Trump had spent $70,000 on hair care.
As Biden campaigned in Michigan, Trump made an aggressive play for pivotal Pennsylvania, focusing largely on his white, working-class base in four rallies, the last ending about 10 p.m. as temperatures fell to near 40 degrees.
""You know,"" Trump told supporters in Montoursville, ""if we win Pennsylvania, it's over. That's why I'm standing up here.""
At an early evening rally in Butler, Trump announced that he had issued a memorandum that calls on government agencies to determine fracking's impact on the economy and trade and the costs of banning the oil and gas extraction through fracking.
The president has repeatedly charged that Biden will end fracking — a big industry in Pennsylvania and other states — even as the former vice president has said that he does not support a ban on fracking.
""In other words, if one of these maniacs come along and they say we're gonna end fracking, we're gonna destroy the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,"" Trump said in announcing his memorandum. ""You can say, sorry about that.""
Earlier in the day in a small town in Bucks County on the eastern edge of the state, Trump raised baseless concerns about election fraud, pointing specifically at Philadelphia, a city whose large African American population is key to Biden's fate in the state.
""They say you have to be very, very careful — what happens in Philadelphia,"" Trump charged. ""Everybody has to watch.""
Republicans are betting that Trump can win a second term by driving up turnout among his strongest supporters — white, noncollege-educated men and rural voters — while limiting Biden's advantage with Blacks and Latinos. Democrats in several swing states worry that voters of color may not be excited enough about Biden to show up in the numbers they need.
In Michigan, Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the Flint area, said he had been pressing for a couple of months for Biden or Obama to visit the majority Black city where a water crisis that began in 2014 sickened the city's residents, exposing stark racial inequities.
""Showing up matters,"" Kildee said. ""The message is important, no question about it. But there's a message implicit in showing up, especially in Flint.""
Biden's campaign announced it was sending Obama to Florida and Georgia on Monday. He is the campaign's most valuable asset to help energize the nonwhite voters Democrats so badly need to defeat Trump. ""Joe Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden, and he will be a great president,"" Obama said Saturday.
The press for Michigan's Black voters comes after voting was down roughly 15% in Flint and Detroit four years ago — a combined 48,000-plus votes in a state Trump carried by about 10,700 votes. Overall, the Black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, falling to 59.6% in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6% four years earlier, according to the Pew Research Center.
Trump isn't ceding Michigan to Biden. He visited Waterford Township, near Detroit, on Friday and held a rally in the state capital, Lansing, this past week, though the surging coronavirus cases are clouding his presidency.
The worst week of the year, in terms of new infections, arrived with Election Day looming. More than 99,000 Americans reported new infections on Friday, a record high, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Trump told Pennsylvania voters that his administration has done ""an incredible job"" dealing with the pandemic. He promised that the mass distribution of a vaccine was ""just weeks away."" He's been saying that since August.
Biden has focused almost exclusively on Trump's inability to control the pandemic. ""We're gonna beat this virus and get it under control and the first step to doing that is beating Donald Trump,"" Biden said.
With the campaign down to the final days, Trump's closing sprint includes, in addition to the four stops in Pennsylvania, nearly a dozen events in the final 48 hours across states he carried in 2016.
Biden will close out his campaign on Monday in Pennsylvania, the state where he was born and the one he's visited more than any other. The Biden team announced that the candidate, his wife, Jill, running mate Kamala Harris, and the senator's husband, Doug Emhoff, plan to ""fan out across all four corners of the state."""

Voting at the polls can mean waiting in lines, dressing for the weather, securing child care, or getting time off work. But for those with disabilities, there is so much more to consider. That's because many Detroit polling places are not accessible or make voting difficult for voters with physical disabilities.
While federal law requires polling places be accessible for disabled voters or for counties to provide an alternate location if a polling place is not accessible, the reality of casting an in-person ballot can be burdensome.
Dessa Cosma, the executive director of Detroit Disability Power (DDP), said she struggled to cast a ballot during the 2018 primary because of her physical disability.
""When I went to vote in my wheelchair, I could get in the polling location, I got my ballot, but when I turned around to fill it out there was nowhere that I could reach,"" she said. ""All of the voting booths were standing height.""
Cosma was offered space on the poll workers' table. When she reminded a worker that she should be entitled to her legal right to a private voting experience, the worker got visibly upset.
""What that told me was they're not prepared for wheelchair voters, haven't thought about accessibility in advance, and they weren't trained how to handle issues with disabled voters.""
Wheelchair access isn't the only issue. People with different types of disabilities, such as those who are hearing impaired or legally blind, also faced issues with accommodations, Cosma said. Since her 2018 experience, Cosma has been working on polling location accessibility for disabled individuals. She co-founded People with Disabilities Voting Rights Coalition to identify issues within the community and address those problems with city and state officials.
To increase accessibility, the Michigan Secretary of State allows disabled voters to apply for an accessible absentee voter ballot. According to the Secretary of State's website, the ballot ""allows voters to mark the documents on an electronic device, using their own assistive technology, without visiting a polling place or clerk's office,"" which makes voting easier for blind voters and others with disabilities who are unable to vote via an absentee ballot privately or independently.
The city of Detroit also introduced 30 ballot drop boxes this year, which allow disabled voters to return their ballots without leaving their cars.
Still, many disabled voters choose to cast ballots in person and by law, voting locations must be accessible.
The Detroit Department of Elections confirmed that every polling place is ADA accessible and has one voter assistance terminal with audio and visual components to help those with disabilities. There are also interpreters, who are identified by their shirts, at the precincts.
Curbside voting is available throughout the state for those who are unable to physically enter the polls, according to the Secretary of State's office. A voter can call the clerk's office to arrange that option or send someone in to notify poll workers that a voter needs assistance. Poll workers are trained on these accessibility options. Moreover, all satellite voting locations are ADA compliant.
However, Cosma believes that without preparation around accessibility and without focused raining about how to interact with people with a variety of disabilities, poll workers and polling locations are not going to work sufficiently for people in that community.
Detroit Disability Power and People with Disabilities Voting Rights Coalition have been working with the Detroit Department of Elections to identify the problems and come up with solutions.
DDP says, despite federal regulations, the organization still fields the following complaints from voters:
Legally, any voter can take someone into the voting booth with them to help them vote, but Cosma said there have been instances in her community when poll workers have told individuals that they cannot take anyone with them to the booth for help.
Teddy Dorsette, communications manager and organizer at DDP, explained how COVID-19 has further complicated issues.
""Deaf voters cannot take verbal instructions and right now with coronavirus, people have masks on so even lip-reading isn't an option,"" Dorsette said.
DDP has worked with the Secretary of State to develop a list of recommendations to pass on to city clerks. However, the election process is decentralized so the Secretary of State and the Bureau of Elections at the state level do not have full control over city clerks.
""The only real enforcement is through a lawsuit, which means it's incumbent on the person impacted by the lack of access to file a lawsuit,"" Cosma said. ""That's honestly a ridiculous bar and not a route we prefer.""
DDP prefers to build relationships with clerks to show them how important it is to proactively address the issues. Before the pandemic, DVPC met monthly with city officials, including Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, who was present at many of those meetings.
""While they were very receptive, we didn't actually see the changes on the ground, even in the elections since that training,"" Cosma said. ""So I want to give Clerk Winfrey props for making time for her staff to meet with us so regularly and since then the city did implement training for poll workers on disability inclusion so the effort was there, I just don't know if the outcome mirrored the effort.""
According to Winfrey, several polling places which were previously inaccessible are now accessible to disabled voters. The Department of Elections confirmed that disabled voters with an inaccessible polling place are eligible to vote without notice at the Department of Elections building until the close of voting at 8 p.m. on Election Day."

Minutes after the court reached its opinion, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced she plans to immediately appeal the decision. She also had appealed the previous ruling striking down the ban.
""We intend to immediately appeal the decision to the Michigan Supreme Court,"" Nessel said in a statement. ""Just today, a poll released by the Detroit News and WDIV-TV indicated that 73% of Michigan voters say openly carried guns should be banned near polling places. The merits of this issue – which impacts all Michiganders - deserves full and expedited consideration by our State's highest court.""

Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Oct. 16 issued a directive to local election clerks to ban the open carry of firearms at all polling places on Election Day.
The directive told clerks that the presence of guns at polling places, clerks offices or absent voter counting boards could cause disruption, fear or intimidation for voters or election workers.
""Fair, free and secure elections are the foundation of our democracy,"" Benson said at the time her directive was issued. ""I am committed to ensuring all eligible Michigan citizens can freely exercise their fundamental right to vote without fear of threats, intimidation or harassment. Prohibiting the open-carry of firearms in areas where citizens cast their ballots is necessary to ensure every voter is protected.""
The rule prohibited firearms within 100 feet of any polling place entrance. However, the action was met with a lawsuit by several gun rights groups in Michigan.
On Tuesday, Chief Judge Christopher Murray granted a preliminary injunction invalidating the ban ahead of Tuesday's election. That decision was appealed by Nessel leading to Thursday's decision."

Michigan presently has 172 cases per million people and positivity of tests has increased from about 2 percent to 5.5 percent, and both indicators have been increasing for over four weeks, officials said.
""The only way to beat COVID is to act on what we've learned since March,"" MDHHS Director Robert Gordon said. ""Wear masks. Keep six feet of distance. Wash hands. And avoid the indoor get-togethers where we have seen COVID explode.""

As part of the newly extended orders, the state reduced the maximum gathering size for indoor gatherings from 500 to 50 people.
This change responds to global evidence that COVID's explosive growth is powered by events where large-scale outbreaks have occurred, and that indoor settings are as much as 20 times likelier to drive outbreaks than outdoor settings, officials said. Michigan has 34 outbreaks related to social events such, officials said. An additional 19 outbreaks of up to 52 cases are linked to church services, which are exempt from enforcement under the order, according to officials.
Indoor party sizes at a single table is now restricted to six people for bars, restaurants and social events, officials said, citing the likelihood that the virus could spread while people eat without wearing masks.
Like many other businesses in Michigan, bars and restaurants will also be required to take names and contact information to support effective contact tracing if necessary, officials said. Research published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown that visiting restaurants is a risk factor for COVID positivity, and currently there are 12 outbreaks in Michigan associated with bars or restaurants with currently active clusters up to 12 cases.
""The orders that MDHHS has issued are centered on keeping the public safe and following best practices to reduce the spread of this deadly virus,"" said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health at MDHHS. ""The alarming surge we are now seeing is exactly why we were so worried about the fall season. We must remain vigilant, so we prevent long-term health consequences and unnecessary deaths, and protect our hospital capacity and the health of our frontline health workers.""
Traverse City Region Moves to Phase 4
Because cases are now at a high level statewide, the order treats all regions of the state the same. The Traverse City region previously had fewer restrictions due to a fewer number of COVID-19 cases, but the area has now been moved into Phase 4 of the MI Safe Start system, joining the rest of the state.
Stronger Recommendations for Indoor Social Gatherings
Alongside the rerelease of Thursday's order, MDHHS published strong recommendations for indoor social gatherings, including at Thanksgiving. Because no one measure confers complete protection in a gathering, the guidance recommends that individuals take multiple steps together, such as getting together outside whenever possible and to limit inside time together.
New Measures to Enhance Enforcement
While continuing to focus on encouraging voluntary compliance with its Emergency Orders, MDHHS has also issued rules that set forth fines for violations of these epidemic orders. Violations are punishable by a civil fine up to $1,000 and may also be treated as a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than six months or a fine of not more than $200, or both. the state said.
Failure to comply with orders may violate a business or professional's licensure requirements or present a workplace safety violation, according to authorities.
""The Michigan State Police continues to encourage Michiganders to follow all public health guidance and orders set in place to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" said Col. Joe Gasper, director of the Michigan State Police. ""It's important that we each take personal responsibility for our actions and that we also encourage those around us to do the same."""

Further details of the visit have not been released.
Both the Biden campaign and the campaign of President Donald Trump in his bid for reelection have visited Michigan several times. Trump is set to make another stop in the Mitten State on Friday, with Vice President Mike Pence visiting Flint on Wednesday.
With less than a week until Election Day, Trump is trailing Biden in most national polls, according to The Associated Press."

The ""Be Kind to Your Mind"" campaign promotes the use of Michigan's free, confidential Stay Well counseling line — which debuted May 13. The campaign aims to combat stigma associated with seeking help for feelings of depression, anxiety, anger or loss – all common during a disaster like COVID-19, the state said in a news release.
""Many of us are having a hard time right now,"" MDHHS Director Robert Gordon said. ""There should be zero shame and zero stigma – just honesty that can help each of us find our own inner strength.""
According to a recent online survey of 99,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, more than one-third of American adults report symptoms of depressive and/or anxiety disorder—triple the rate reported in 2019, the state said. Another survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control in June found more than one in 10 U.S. adults had considered suicide in the past 30 days. That rate was more than double what was reported in 2019.
""Stay Well counselors help people understand their feelings and reactions during a disaster like the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Dr. Debra Pinals, a psychiatrist and MDHHS' medical director for behavioral health. ""While they are not licensed mental health professionals, they have undergone training provided by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on how to help people mentally rebound from disasters.""
Pinals said the Stay Well counselors are taught to listen, not judge, and help callers develop coping strategies, review their options and connect with agencies that may help them. All of this can reduce callers' stress and improve their ability to endure the realities they face, she said.
According to a report prepared by the Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration grant team, callers to the Stay Well line are experiencing a range of emotions. They are anxious about contracting the coronavirus, having a loved one contract the virus and keeping their children and/or parents safe, the state said. They are discouraged about continued unemployment, worried about going back to work in an unsafe environment, and lonely due to lack of social interaction. Many callers expressed gratitude for being able to talk to someone who was objective and non-judgmental, according to a news release.
""This service is one of the many steps MDHHS has taken to support the public's behavioral health during these stressful and uncertain times,"" said Allen Jansen, MDHHS Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration senior deputy director. ""COVID-19 has impacted most everyone's mental health in one way or another, and we are here to help."""

""We are too close to Election Day, and the right to vote is too important, to rely on the Postal Service to deliver absentee ballots on time,"" Benson said. ""Citizens who already have an absentee ballot should sign the back of the envelope and hand-deliver it to their city or township clerk's office or ballot drop box as soon as possible. Voters who haven't yet received their ballot should go to their clerk's office to request it in person. They can fill it out, sign the envelope and submit it all in one trip.""
More than 2 million people have already cast ballots absentee for the Nov. 3 General Election, according to the SOS office. More than 3.1 million people in Michigan have requested absentee ballots.
Voters wondering where they can find the locations of their clerk offices and ballot drop boxes can do so by visiting the state's election information website here. Once an absentee ballot has been submitted, it can be tracked online to ensure it is received. Anyone who sees their ballot is not received should contact their clerk immediately, the SOS office said.
Absentee ballots will be available at clerk offices until 4 p.m. Nov. 2. Anyone unregistered by wanting to register can do so at their clerk's office and then vote absentee there through 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Absentee ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day to be counted.
Voters can seek assistance from family or a household member to deliver their ballot for them, but Benson said that with only a week until the election, the USPS should be considered a last resort."
185,/michigan/detroit/trump-looms-large-over-michigan-election-board-deadlock,2020-11-18T23:14:58Z,Trump Loomed Large Over Michigan Election Board...,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"DETROIT — President Donald Trump offered up his first tweet praising two Michigan Republicans for blocking certification of election results only after the pair did an abrupt about-face in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.
But everyone watching the meeting of a key Detroit-area election board suspected that the president's efforts to cast doubt on the election played an outsized role in the vote, which briefly threatened to delay the official declaration of Biden's victory in the state.
Republicans Monica Palmer and William Hartmann initially voted against certification Tuesday, leaving the Wayne County Board of Canvassers deadlocked at 2-2 along party lines. Palmer complained that certain Detroit precincts were out of balance, meaning that absentee ballot books sometimes did not match the number of ballots cast.
The meeting's public comment period brought a swift and sharp rebuke, with the Detroit NAACP president, the Rev. Wendell Anthony, calling Palmer and Hartmann ""a disgrace."" The criticism went on for hours.
""This is the deadly political virus attacking our election process,"" Anthony said Wednesday. ""It should not take such actions on the part of the people to get our public officials to adhere to the express will and intent of the people.""
Biden crushed Trump in Wayne County, a Democratic stronghold, by a more than 2-1 margin on his way to winning Michigan by 146,000 votes, according to unofficial results. His victory reversed Trump's 2016 gains in the industrial Midwest and put Biden on the path to achieving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.
The county canvassers later voted again and certified the results 4-0.
There has been no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Michigan or any other state. Federal and state officials from both parties have declared the 2020 election safe and secure. But Trump and his allies have spent two weeks raising false claims of fraud and refusing to concede to Biden. That has put pressure on GOP election officials.
Norman Shinkle, one of the two Republican members of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that he had not been contacted by anyone with the Trump campaign. But he said he was bombarded with phone calls and emails from random Trump supporters urging him not to approve the election results.
""They know I'm a Republican and they say, 'Don't certify,'"" he said.
Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox reacted swiftly after the deadlock. An email landed immediately at The Associated Press, with Cox saying she was proud that the party's work had caused GOP canvassers to refuse to bless the election results.
Earlier in the day, Democrats began to doubt whether Republicans would certify the vote.
""We all noticed they were on their phones (during the meeting),"" Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes said. ""There were a lot of text messages. Something is clearly at work. This isn't their first canvass with precincts out of balance. They have certified elections that are more out of balance.""
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, whose district includes portions of Wayne County, said she had anticipated that the two GOP board members ""would get lots of calls from senior people"" in their party pressuring them to vote against certification.
Dingell said she and fellow Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit phoned local leaders and activists ahead of the meeting ""to make sure there would be balanced attendance.""
Detroit, which is about 80% Black, has been a frequent target of Trump, along with Philadelphia and Atlanta — cities with large African American populations that voted for Biden.
The deadlocked vote in Wayne County was a blatant attempt at voter suppression fueled by ""50% racism and 50% Republican politics because of Trump,"" said Nicole Small, one of hundreds of people who watched Tuesday's meeting.
Palmer's and Hartmann's changes of heart came after ""three hours of being berated by the public,"" said Wayne County Commission Chair Alisha Bell, a Democrat who is Black.
""They came to their senses to do the right thing,"" Bell said. ""This was just wrong. They had to single it out against Detroit.""
The Associated Press left messages Wednesday seeking comment from Palmer and Hartmann.
Wayne County did not seem prepared for the public's interest in the meeting. Because of the coronavirus, in-person attendance was limited. Access through Zoom was limited to 100 people and was later expanded to 300.
County canvassing board Vice Chair Jonathan Kinloch, a Democrat, said the public comments ""tilled the ground"" and allowed him to take Palmer and Hartmann aside to urge them to reconsider their vote.
""I've known them to be very decent members. I know they were under a lot of pressure"" from other Republicans, Kinloch said Wednesday in an interview.
Wayne County's election results and those of Michigan's other 82 counties now go to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, who then presents them to the state canvassing board, which is scheduled to meet Nov. 23. That board also has four members — two Democrats and two Republicans.
""You just don't know"" what will happen, Barnes said.
Shinkle, a former state senator who been on the state board for 12 years, said he was troubled by the way the election was handled in Detroit. In particular, he said, the city failed to have a Republican working on the election staff in each of the 516 precincts, as required by law.
""I think that's a serious problem,"" Shinkle said. ""From my perspective, the law wasn't followed. I can say we have serious problems. The question is: Do we throw out the election because of it?""
The state board is tasked with reviewing the county results and compiling the certified totals into statewide totals, according to Chris Thomas, a former Michigan elections director who served as an adviser to Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey for the general election.
""This is not just a vote to certify the presidential election. This certifies the entire state, said Thomas, who added that by not certifying the county results, the state board would ""would basically nullify the entire election"" in Michigan.

But these are not normal times.
As part of an ongoing series of attacks on the integrity of the election, President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are trying to stop the formal certification of results in some of the states where he lost — mostly by making unsubstantiated claims of fraud.
While most of their attempts (many of them lawsuits) have been shot down in court or by election officials, a high-profile example in Michigan's largest county this week shows just how easily the process can get sidetracked.
After an election, local officials count ballots, review the tallies to make sure they match the votes cast, and check that people who cast provisional ballots because of some problem at the polls did so legally.
Local elections office then sends the final results to a board for certification. Such boards are typically bipartisan, their members either elected or appointed by county leaders. Barring an obvious problem with the count that could change the result of the election, the board then approves the vote tallies before sending them to the state for final certification. That's usually done by a state canvassing board, the secretary of state or a small group that might include the governor and other state officials.
From there, federal law requires governors to prepare official certificates to report the popular vote in their states. These documents are often signed by the governors and must carry the seal of the state. A copy is sent to the archivist of the United States.
What Happened This Time?
In an extraordinary move Tuesday night, two Republican members on Michigan's Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted against certifying of the county's votes — then abruptly reversed course amid heavy criticism.
Explaining the initial vote, a Republican member of the Wayne County board said poll books in the majority-Black city of Detroit were out of balance. But a Democrat on the board noted the issues were the result of routine ""human error,"" and the Republican's claim drew complaints of racism from Democrats and election experts who also noted there has been no sign of widespread voting fraud in Michigan or elsewhere.
And the results weren't even close: President-elect Joe Biden beat Trump in Wayne County by a more than 2-to-1 margin and won Michigan by 146,000 votes, according to unofficial results.
Even though the Wayne County votes were certified in the end, the incident is likely to cast more doubt about the election's legitimacy among Trump's supporters. It also could help galvanize Republicans elsewhere to look for ways to delay making Biden's victory official.

Election workers speaking to the board said that despite unpleasant and disruptive poll challengers, the ballot counting process went smoothly. Others, including residents in the city of Detroit, called the two votes to not certify the election results politically and even racially motived.

But after about three hours of public comments, the board took a second vote, opting to certify the results under the condition that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson audit precincts that were discovered to be out-of-balance.
Wayne County, a Democratic stronghold, is significant in that it is Michigan's largest county. Biden defeated Trump by more than 322,000 votes in the Wayne County, according to unofficial results, on his way to carrying the state. Biden's overall lead in Michigan over Trump is nearly 146,000 votes, according to unofficial results.
Tuesday's vote to certify election results in Wayne County means the state will meet Nov. 23 to certify statewide election results.
After the board's initial decision to not certify the results, outrage flared at a suggestion that all of Wayne County should be certified aside from the city of Detroit. During the public comment period, several callers had harsh words for the board's decision. The move was questioned as being racially motivated by one board member, considering the city's majority Black population.
Monica Palmer, the board chairperson, made the suggestion.
""(We should) certify this election like we are supposed to,"" a Democratic board member said in response. ""We aren't going to be picking out people of color.""
Wayne County residents who sat in on the meeting agreed with the Democratic board members' views. Sarida Scott, a Detroit resident who worked at the TCF Center, said election officials at the center did an amazing job despite frequent interruptions, yelling and chants of ""stop the count.""
She added that the two Republican board members had political and racial motives behind their votes.
""I am dismayed and disgusted by the travesty that has occurred here this evening and the blatant racism that has fueled it,"" she said. ""Please know the people's voices will be heard.""
Another member of the public, Ned Staebler, chastised the two Republican board members for their initial votes to not certify the election results, saying they had made their decisions prior to viewing election information.
Staebler called out the board members who suggesting they certify election results outside of Detroit after previously acknowledging that Livonia, a city that is predominately white, had higher out-of-balance variances than Detroit.
""I just want to let you know that the Trump stink and stain of racism that you, William Hartman and Monica Palmer, have just covered yourself in is going to follow you throughout history,"" Staebler told the board members. ""Your grandchildren are going to think of you like Bull Connor or George Wallace. Monica Palmer and William Hartman will forever be known in southeastern Michigan as two racists who did something so unprecedented that they disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of Black voters in the city of Detroit.""
Joseph Zimmerman, an Air Force veteran and University of Michigan law student, told the board Tuesday that while working as a nonpartisan observer at the TCF Center on Election Day there were no issues with the processing of absentee ballots.
Zimmerman told the board that he believed the workers and supervisors working to ensure ballots were processed did ""an outstanding job of counting every vote,"" despite aggressive Republican challengers.
""(They worked well) even as the numerous Republican challengers in the room repeatedly made challenges that were baseless and lacked credibility,"" he said. ""(It was) like challengers had clearly been coached to challenge every ballot that wasn't for Trump.""
Clare Allenson, the civic engagement director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, also recounted aggressive Republican challengers.
""(Election workers) were further intimidated by Republican challengers who not only made claims of malfeasance or something else but also refused to wear PPE,"" she said.
The suggestion of not including Detroit when certifying Wayne County election results was also something Allenson said she took issue with.
""To say that you would certify these votes across the county, side from one city, again, is a disgrace,"" she said.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan was critical of board members who initially suggested not including Detroit in their election certification and thanked Detroit residents who spoke up.
""Had the Board of Canvassers disenfranchised 1.4 million Wayne County voters over partisan politics, it would have been an historically shameful act,"" he said on Twitter. ""Glad to see common sense prevailed in the end. Thank you to all those citizens who spoke up so passionately - you made the difference!""
But to some, the two board members opposing the certification simply were bullied into changing their votes.
Trump campaign legal adviser Jenna Ellis called the members of the public who commented after the initial vote a ""mob.""
""In Wayne Co, MI, 71% of their precincts' ballot counts don't match total number of voters! 2 board members refused to certify results, then suddenly caved amid threats,"" she said on Twitter. ""America doesn't yield to the mob!""
Trump took to Twitter to share his dismay with Detroit residents speaking out at the meeting, saying the two dissenting board members were ""forced"" to change their vote.
""At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!),"" Trump tweeted. ""Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don't Harass!"""
188,/michigan/detroit/wayne-county-deadlocks-election-results-certification,2020-11-17T23:24:25Z,Wayne County Election Results Certified After...,0,39,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"WAYNE COUNTY, MI — The Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted unanimously Tuesday to certify the county's results from the Nov.3 presidential election after initially deadlocking along party lines with the board's two Republican members voting against certification.
The board voted 4-0 to certify the election results but with a request to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to audit precincts that were discovered to be out-of-balance.
Board members initially failed to certify the county's Nov. 3 election results, splitting the vote to certify the results 2-2.
The initial vote was along party lines, with Monica Palmer, the board chairperson, and William Hartmann — both Republicans — voting against certification. Board Vice Chair Jonathan Kinloch and Allen Wilson, both Democrats, voted in favor of certification.
The board's decision to certify the election results came after Republican members of the board were criticized after a suggestion that all of Wayne County should be certified aside from the city of Detroit. During the public comment period, several callers had harsh words for the board's decision. The move was questioned as being racially motivated by one board member, considering the city's majority Black population.

President Donald Trump claimed the state refused to certify the results.
""Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results!"" he posted on Twitter. ""Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!""
After the initial vote, board members argued about allowing politics to become a part of their vote.
Palmer said she did not have full confidence in how votes were calculated due to a high number of out of balance absentee ballot books and said all votes outside the city of Detroit — where the majority of unbalanced books were found — should be certified. Other board members disagreed.
""It's my hope that the state will take over and work with the clerks,"" Palmer said.
""I smell politics,"" another board member rebuked.
Palmer suggested at one point that the board certify Wayne County's election results except for the city of Detroit, which one Democratic board member took issue with.
""(We should) certify this election like we are supposed to,"" the board member said. ""We aren't going to be picking out people of color.""
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan also took issue with the suggestion, and said the board eventually made the right move while adding that claims about election fraud are baseless.
""Had the Board of Canvassers disenfranchised 1.4 million Wayne County voters over partisan politics, it would have been an historically shameful act,"" he said on Twitter. ""Glad to see common sense prevailed in the end. Thank you to all those citizens who spoke up so passionately - you made the difference!""
Tuesday's meeting — which was held via Zoom for interested members of the public — did not go off without issue. While it was scheduled to begin at 3 p.m., issues caused the meeting to be delayed by nearly two hours. When the final vote was taken, it was nearly 9:20 p.m.
The board also capped the online meeting at 100 attendees, meaning many people were unable to attend the public meeting. Capacity was then expanded to 300 people and quickly filled up once more.
Technical issues prior to the start of the recording of the meeting — as well as during — also provided delays and issues for those in virtual attendance.
Canvassers discussed a number of precincts that were out of balance, meaning the number of signatures of people who signed in to the polling location to vote was not the same as the number of people who actually voted at the respective location.
Out of balance precincts can be caused by simple events, however, such as someone visiting a polling location, signing in and then leaving later because the line is too long and they have another obligation.
""Should the current decision of the Board of Wayne County Canvassers hold through the adjournment of today's meeting, the Board of State Canvassers will be responsible for certifying the Wayne County election,"" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement after the first vote that ended in a deadlock.
""In similar circumstances in the past, state canvassers have appointed the Bureau of Elections to carry out the processes of canvassing the vote and voter totals. The Bureau stands ready to fulfill this duty and we expect this will address clerical errors and improve the quality of the canvass overall.
""It is common for some precincts in Michigan and across the country to be out of balance by a small number of votes, especially when turnout is high. Importantly, this is not an indication that any votes were improperly cast or counted.""
In a statement released ahead of the board's final vote, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer reiterated that Biden won the election by over 140,000 votes and said she was confident the results would be certified once the Board of State of Canvassers finish the job.
""In refusing to approve the results of the election in Wayne County, the two Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers have placed partisan politics above their legal duty to certify the election results,"" Whitmer said in a statement. ""The people have spoken: Joe Biden won Michigan by more than 140,000 votes. Today's action is a blatant attempt to undermine the will of the voters. The process, however, will move forward. Under Michigan law, the Board of State of Canvassers will now finish the job and I have every expectation they will certify the results when the job is done.""
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who represents parts of Detroit, said the board put politics above their duty to residents.
""Suggesting that all of Wayne County can be certified, EXCEPT for Detroit, is horrifying racist and a subversion of our democracy,"" Tlaib wrote in a tweet.
Michigan election law prohibits a precinct that is out of balance to be recounted, however. But the Michigan Secretary of State office said that in Wayne County, precincts that are out of balance without explanation can still be recounted as long as the number of ballots in the container matches the statement of votes on the tabulator. Many containers have not yet been opened, according to the SOS.
Unbalanced precincts have historically been a problem in Detroit, where 72 percent of poll books in the August primary were out of balance. In the 2016 presidential election — when Donald Trump won the state and the presidency — a state audit in Detroit found a series of mismatched Detroit vote totals in the presidential election, attributing them to human error and not to widespread voter fraud.
During that presidential election, 71 percent of precincts could not be balanced, but the audit reduced the magnitude of the discrepancies ""significantly.""
Dialogue between a county elections worker and board members focused around how the unbalanced precincts weren't just in Detroit, but across the entire county. The worker told board members that due to the significant volume of absentee ballots, local election officials were stretched to the limit.
Tuesday is the deadline for counties in Michigan to certify their election results. In Wayne County, Democratic President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump 587,074 to 264,149, according to unofficial election results provided by the county ahead of the meeting.
Wayne County has been considered a significant battleground in the Nov. 3 presidential race. A heavy vote gain for Biden through absentee ballots counted late on Election Day and into the following day allowed the presidential challenger to overtake Trump in the county and, eventually, the state.
The late surge drew the ire of Michigan Republicans as well as Trump. Trump on social media began questioning — without evidence — the legitimacy of some absentee ballots. Protesters outside the TCF Center in Detroit where ballots were being counted became disruptive and chanted ""Let us in"" and ""Stop the count,"" according to people working at the center.
The Trump campaign has filed lawsuits to block the certification of election results in Michigan, but the state appeals court has repeatedly denied the campaign's bids to stop the certification of Detroit-area votes.
A Michigan judge on Friday refused to stop the certification of Detroit-area election results, rejecting claims by Trump's campaign that the city had committed fraud and tainted the count with its handling of absentee ballots.
Friday's ruling marked the third time a judge declined to intervene in a statewide count that shows Biden up by more than 140,000 votes.

Despite the legal setbacks, Michigan Republicans have continued to call for full, independent audit of the state's election prior to election results being certified by the state's board of canvassers Monday.
Michigan Senate President Pro Tempore Aric Nesbitt on Monday said he and other Senate Republicans are calling for the audit due to the number of allegations stemming from the absentee ballot counting process.
""We have seen a number of allegations that range from outright fraud, if true, to terrible mistakes that need to be corrected,"" Nesbitt said. ""Citizens deserve to have faith in the integrity of the election process and its outcome. It is our responsibility, as elected public servants, to assure the process's integrity through transparency and the investigation of allegations of wrongdoing. Every legal vote must count.""
A broad coalition of top government and industry officials also declared that the Nov. 3 election was ""the most secure in American history,"" except for the usual minor hiccups.
""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement Thursday."

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Michigan's Western District Court, argues that the state violated the rights of Michigan businesses and seeks to have the court rule that the orders are unconstitutional as such.
Justin Winslow, the CEO of the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association, said the agency took ""several good faith efforts"" in advance of the Sunday order, which restricted indoor and outdoor gatherings in Michigan and prohibited eateries across the state for indoor service. Winslow said the lawsuit was the ""last available option to prevent the outright devastation of restaurant operators and their hundreds of thousands of employees across the state.""

""We are hopeful for a swift and decisive victory in court so restaurant operators may return to what we know they do best — adding value to our lives and our economy by providing a great meal and exceptional hospitality in a safe, socially distanced, sanitized and regulated environment,"" Winslow said.
MRLA survey data suggests more than 40 percent of restaurants will close, at least temporarily, if dining rooms are closed, and that about 250,000 employees are likely to be laid off from restaurants over the holiday season.
If the closure is prolonged and federal stimulus dollars are not made immediately available, upwards of 6,000 more restaurants will permanently close by spring, the association projects. It also said roughly 2,000 restaurants have already closed their doors permanently in Michigan in 2020.
""Closing the restaurant industry will again wreak havoc on the supply chain, which will have an outsized impact on Michigan's broader economy and possibly imperil basic supplies from reaching Michiganders,"" Winslow said.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, along with MDHHS Chief Deputy for Health Joneigh Khaldun and MDHHS Director Robert Gordon, who is named in the lawsuit, announced the restrictions Sunday after the state saw a significant uptick in new cases and deaths stemming from the coronavirus.
Among the restrictions, a request that indoor residential gatherings are limited to two households at any one time, and that families should only interact with one other household over the next three weeks.
""This situation has never been more dire,"" Whitmer said during a news conference announcing the restrictions Sunday. ""As the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, the virus will spread and more people will get sick and there will be more fatalities.""
But the restrictions, which take place Wednesday and will remain in effect for three weeks until Dec. 8, are too much, according to some state officials who now are calling for the impeachment of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Matt Maddock, a state representative who represents parts of Oakland County, said Whitmer ""crossed the line"" with the restrictions, and he is calling for the governor's impeachment over the issue.
In responding to Maddock's tweet, Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman with Whitmer's office, told WXYZ the governor doesn't have time for ""partisan politics or people who don't wear masks, don't believe in science, and don't have a plan to fight this virus.""
""Right now, she is focused on saving lives,"" Brown said. ""The governor will continue to work hard for all 10 million Michiganders. This is about Michigan vs. COVID-19. Governor Whitmer doesn't care if you're a Trump Republican or a Biden Democrat. We are all in this together.""
GOP lawmakers in Michigan had their own gripes with the restrictions, with Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey on Sunday issuing a statement that criticized Whitmer for not working more with Republican legislators and instead going on her own to issue the restrictions.
""The Senate Republicans will continue working with our doctors and the medical community on ways we can combat this virus and are ready to work with the governor when she decides to work as a team to fight this virus,"" he said."

""Citizens deserve to have faith in the integrity of the election process and its outcome. It is our responsibility, as elected public servants, to assure the process's integrity through transparency and the investigation of allegations of wrongdoing. Every legal vote must count.""
In a letter to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Nesbitt cited ballot counting issues in Antrim County, where an error caused thousands of ballots to be counted incorrectly for the wrong candidates.
While the issue was discovered and corrected, Nesbitt said it is unclear if the same issue was replicated elsewhere.
Antrim County used Dominion Voting Systems to process its ballots, and that voting system has recently been called into question by President Donald Trump, who lost to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden in Michigan, according to unofficial election results.
Dominion Voting Systems said in a statement to The Associated Press that it ""denies claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems.""
A broad coaltion of top government and industry officials also declared that the Nov. 3 election was ""the most secure in American history,"" sans for the usual minor hiccups.
""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised,"" the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement Thursday.
There have been only a ""small handful"" of issues that were the result of human error involving voting technology, not the software itself, said Eddie Perez, a voting technology expert at the OSET Institute, a nonpartisan election technology research and development nonprofit.
The OSET Institute has helped monitor more than 1,000 reports of voting issues throughout the U.S. since Election Day, according to The Associated Press.
The calls for an audit is the latest move by Michigan Republicans who question the validity of Nov. 3 election results. There also have been bevvy of lawsuits filed throughout Michigan courts seeking to stop the counting of ballots or calling for an audit of election results, all of which have been thrown out due to a lack of evidence.

Jones and the Infinite Scholars Program will host the Detroit Virtual College Scholarship Fair Week Raffle at 6 p.m., where 10 laptops will be given away as prizes to students who qualified for scholarships during last week's college fair.
The raffle can be viewed live here and is the culmination of the nation's first ever weeklong virtual Infinite Scholars College Fair.
From Nov. 9-13, nearly 300 students met one-on-one in Zoom breakout rooms with recruiters from more than 70 colleges from across the nation, and $2,381,928 in on-site qualifying scholarships were awarded. Many also received on-site admittance to the college of their choice, according to a news release.
The college fair, usually a large-scale, in-person event at Eastern Market Shed 3, was held virtually as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Wayne County Community College District was present to discuss its new skilled trades Horizontal Infrastructure Training Center. The Detroit School of Digital Technology and the College for Creative Studies provided scholarships for digital and creative arts. The U.S. Naval Academy also was present to meet with the young men and women seeking to receive an education and serve their country."

The new restrictions were announced Sunday night during a news conference.
State health officials cited a recent spike in COVID-19 virus infections in issuing the restrictions, which include capping indoor residential gatherings to people from no more than two households and limiting outdoor gatherings to 25 people.
Michigan has seen an uptick in new coronavirus cases in recent weeks. As of Saturday, the state had reported more than 251,000 confirmed cases of the virus and nearly 8,000 reported COVID-19-releated deaths.
The state also has reported that over 138,000 people in the state have recovered from the virus.
Whitmer said that data gathered by state health officials suggests that if Michigan stays on its current track, it could see more than 1,000 COVID-19-related deaths per week. Officials also said they are investigating 980 COVID-19 virus outbreaks across the state — including over 200 in schools.
""I want you to think about that,"" Whitmer said Sunday. ""One thousand deaths per week is what one of the models tells us to date.""
But the restrictions were not met with open arms. In addition to Maddock's comments, Scott Atlas, an adviser with President Donald Trump, posted to Twitter that ""the only way this stops is if people rise up. You get what you accept.""
The tweet drew immediate criticism for what some saw as its apparent suggestion for violence.
Responding to a question about Atlas' tweet, Whitmer told CNN she won't be bullied into not following health guidelines.
""We know that the White House likes to single us out here in Michigan, me out in particular,"" she said. ""I'm not going to be bullied into not following reputable scientists and medical professionals.""
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who issued a statement supporting the restrictions amid the pandemic, called Atlas' comments ""irresponsible.""
""This statement is disappointing, irresponsible, and the reason why the United States finds itself in such desperate circumstances regarding COVID-19,"" she said on Twitter. ""I look forward to a new federal administration that works cooperatively with our state government to protect Michigan residents.""
Atlas has since attempted to clear up his intention regarding the tweet, saying he never ""was talking at all about violence.""
""People vote, people peacefully protest,"" he tweeted. ""NEVER would I endorse or incite violence. NEVER!!""
GOP lawmakers in Michigan had their own gripes with the restrictions, with Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey on Sunday issuing a statement that criticized Whitmer for not working more with Republican legislators and instead going on her own to issue the restrictions.

Michigan shattered its single-day record of new coronavirus cases Friday, reporting more than 8,500 new cases of the virus.
Michigan has seen an uptick in new coronavirus cases in recent weeks. As of Saturday, the state had reported more than 251,000 confirmed cases of the virus and nearly 8,000 reported COVID-19 deaths.
The state has reported that over 138,000 people in the state have recovered from the virus.

""I want you to think about that,"" she said Sunday. ""1,000 deaths per week is what one of the models tells us to date.""
Officials said the order is aimed at limiting residential and non-residential gatherings where COVID-19 spreads rapidly. Bars and restaurants will be open for outdoor dining, carry-out and delivery only. Gyms will remain open for individual exercise with strict safety measures in place. Casinos, movie theaters and group exercise classes will be closed.
Professional and college sports meeting extraordinary standards for risk mitigation may continue without spectators, but the state said all other organized sports must stop. Colleges and high schools may proceed with remote learning, but must end in-person classes.
""Indoor gatherings are the greatest source of spread, and sharply limiting them is our focus,"" MDHHS Director Robert Gordon said. ""The order is targeted and temporary, but a terrible loss of life will be forever unless we act. By coming together today, we can save thousands of lives.""
Sunday's order, which takes effect Wednesday, is not a blanket stay-home action like what was issued in the spring, Whitmer said. The order leaves open work that cannot be performed from home, including for manufacturing, construction and health occupations. Outdoor gatherings, outdoor dining and parks remain open.
Individualized activities with distancing and face masks are still allowed: retail shopping; public transit; restaurant takeout; personal-care services such as haircuts, by appointment; and individualized exercise at a gym, with extra spacing between machines.
Michigan has seen fewer outbreaks associated with elementary and middle schools, and younger children are most in need of in-person instruction, the state said in a news release. In-person K-8 schooling may continue if it can be done with strong mitigation, including mask requirements, based on discussion between local health and school officials. Childcare also remains open to support working parents.
""The data we are seeing is alarming. COVID-19 is impacting every area of our state,"" said MDHHS Chief Deputy for Health Joneigh Khaldun. ""Our healthcare systems are becoming overwhelmed, and our contact tracers cannot keep up. If we do not act now, we risk thousands more deaths, and even more people having long-term health consequences. The actions we are taking today are the best opportunity we have to get this virus under control."""

The survey, which appeared in questionnaire form Thursday on Patch, is meant not to be a scientific poll but only to give a broad idea of public sentiment.
A majority of the respondents said they either voted early in-person or voted absentee by mail and either mailed in their ballot or dropped it off. The overwhelming majority — 64.3 percent — dropped their ballot versus just 6.5 percent who mailed in their ballot. About 27 percent of respondents said they voted in-person on Election Day.
SEE ALSO: Patch Survey: Majority Trust The 2020 Election Results
Still, though the majority did drop off their ballots, it apparently wasn't over a lack of confidence in the system. Just over 50 percent of respondents strongly agreed that voting by mail is safe, reliable and generally free of fraud.
For those who mailed in their ballots, just 24 percent said they felt more confident about voting by mail and nearly 51 percent of respondents said their confidence level was unchanged.
""It was just as safe as in past years,"" one person said. ""I chose to deliver it in person due to USPS issues.""
""I would have to say that voting by absentee ballot this year was easier than going to the polling location and standing in line for sure,"" another respondent said.
One person felt voting should be in person on Election Day to eliminate any chance of potential fraud.
""All voting should be in person, on election day,"" the person wrote. ""That way it will eliminate the chance of voter fraud. Anytime you have people handling ballots there is doubt about the count.""
One person found the number of requests overwhelming.
""I think that absentee ballot requests should only be sent out by the city clerk's office and absentee ballots should only be given if requested. And no other entity should be allowed to solicit absentee ballots, as at least 7 other groups have done. I received a form stating that someone in my house was not registered to vote and could they register them. I am the only person living in my house.""
""There is no way to ensure that mail in voting is completely secure,"" another person wrote. ""I will continue to vote at the polls on election day to ensure that my vote is counted.""
Another person was grateful for the option to vote by mail:
""I truly believe that voting by mail is a wonderful thing especially during flu season. It's great for the elderly, disabled, and even parents with little ones (try keeping them busy for an hour or so in line). I also truly believe that the counting is valid do to the ballot counters being from both sides. Plus I'm sure the people that are chosen are honorable people.""

Numerous affidavits from election challengers ""paint a picture of sinister fraudulent activities occurring both openly in the TCF Center and under the cloak of darkness,"" Kenny said.
But those claims are contradicted by Christopher Thomas, a highly-respected former state elections director who spent hours at the center and presented different accounts.
""Perhaps if Plaintiff's election challenger affiants had attended the October 29, 2020, walk-through of the TCF Center ballot counting location, questions and concerns could have been answered in advance of Election Day,"" the judge said in his ruling.
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump by 146,000 votes in Michigan during the general election, according to unofficial election results. Michigan counties and the state Board of Canvassers have yet to certify the election results, however.
Friday's ruling marks the third time a judge has declined intervening in the process to confirm election results in Michigan. Other lawsuits filed by Trump's campaign sought to stop the counting of ballots and asked for challengers to have additional access to ballot processing.
The lawsuit rejected on Friday claimed Republican challengers were removed from the TCF Center in Detroit while absentee ballots were being processed. It also claimed ballots were backdated and that signatures on ballot envelopes were not verified.
Election officials have said they allowed the maximum number of poll watchers for both political parties, with the only restrictions being put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In interviews with workers at the TCF Center in Detroit, where ballots were counted, election officials told Patch of few irregularities, instead noting only ""aggressive"" and uninformed challengers."

The Trump campaign has not provided any evidence or proof of the claims presented in the lawsuit. The suit is part of a broader strategy by the campaign to pursue litigation in key swing states in order to have votes thrown out, even though there is no evidence of the scale of voter fraud that would be required to overturn election results.
Trump's campaign claims that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, in her role as the state's head elections official, did not follow Michigan's election code ""and allowed fraud and incompetence to corrupt the conduct of the 2020 general election,"" according to the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan.
Benson and local election officials failed in their duty by not providing designated ballot challengers the ""meaningful opportunity to observe the conduct of elections,"" the lawsuit states.
Related: Joe Biden Projected Winner In Michigan Over Donald Trump
""Michigan voters were denied a fair, honest, and transparent election because, among other things, election challengers were denied opportunity to meaningfully observe the processing and counting of ballots,"" the lawsuit continues.
Other claims presented in the lawsuit include that ballots were unlawfully duplicated, ineligible ballots were counted — sometimes multiple times; absentee voter ballots were pre-dated to ensure they were counted; ballots were deposited in remote, unattended drop boxes without meaningful opportunities to observe or challenge the ballots; and that Wayne County used ballot tabulators that were allegedly shown to miscount votes cast for Trump and instead count them for Biden.
Trump trails Biden by more than 146,000 votes in Michigan, according to unofficial vote totals. But the president claims that he would have won were it not for ""illegal"" votes counted in several states that he lost or where he is currently trailing.
However, Trump and his allies haven't offered any proof, The Associated Press reported. Thus, his claims have been considered unfounded, and state officials from both parties, as well as international observers, have not reported any irregularities from Election Day.
In interviews with Patch, some election workers said the only concerns they had during the ballot counting process came from aggressive and uninformed challengers.

Some issues have been reported across the state. In Antrim County, a software issue first showed tallies heavily favored Biden. But after review, revised totals showed Trump defeating Biden while getting 56 percent of the vote, according to WZZM.
In Bay County, after the vote totals at three precincts were erroneously not counted, Biden padded his lead by more than 2,500 votes over Trump, according to ABC12 news.
An issue with ballots in Rochester Hills affected the unofficial results of a county commissioner race, officials said.
However, the lawsuit filed Tuesday presents similar claims to past lawsuits the campaign has filed in Michigan and other states, the majority of which have been quickly thrown out.
Last week, Trump's campaign filed lawsuits attempting to order state election officials in Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states to stop counting ballots while also allowing their campaign additional access to the ballot counting process.
In Michigan, that lawsuit was thrown out by Michigan Judge Cynthia Stephens, and a follow-up appeal was also rebuked Monday for having not met certain criteria.

Gretchen Whitmer and a bipartisan group of state legislators on Tuesday announced the introduction of legislation supporting military personnel, veterans and their families to reduce barriers to professional licensure.
The legislature would allow veterans and service members that have a professional license in a different state to become licensed in Michigan ""without having to jump through a bunch of hoops,"" Whitmer said.
""Our dedicated military servicemembers put their lives on the line for our families, and we have a duty to ensure their support when they return home,"" Whitmer said. ""That means making sure they have paths to good jobs so they can sustain their families. Today's legislation will help us do just that. Clearing the path for our military servicemembers, veterans, and their dependents to enter a licensed profession will help us attract and retain talent in Michigan, and by making it easier for our military servicemembers to be licensed, we can make Michigan their home to live and work, permanently.""
The legislation introduced Tuesday will make current military personnel, veterans and their dependents eligible for license reciprocity in Michigan. Servicemembers will be eligible if they hold a valid occupational license in another state, are in good standing with no pending disciplinary action and demonstrate competency in their profession through education, training and work experience, according to a news release.
The Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs will determine whether these criteria are satisfied, officials said.
Currently, veterans are eligible for initial license, registration, or application fee waivers for professional occupations regulated under the Occupational Code and the Skilled Trades Regulation Act. But the legislation introduced Tuesday will expand present fee waivers under those Acts to include dependents of veterans and those on Active Duty. Fee waivers will also be extended to health professions licensed under the Public Health Code. A dependent is defined as a spouse or child under the age of 26.
""This is an important change that would allow health care professionals, skilled trades experts and many others to find jobs in Michigan more quickly — cutting through red tape that causes needless delays,"" said Rep. Andrea Schroeder of Oakland County's Independence Township. ""These reforms will support our military families, who have sacrificed so much to protect us, and the communities in which they live."""

In anticipation of rapid approval from the Food and Drug Administration, Michigan is looking to the Michigan National Guard to provide logistical support and transportation support to help distribute the vaccine, the state said.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Michigan National Guard members have helped distribute more than 14 million pounds of food at food banks, delivered tests and protective equipment across the state, and assisted with testing more than 200 thousand Michiganders for COVID-19, according to state officials.

The original lawsuit was filed at 4 p.m. Wednesday in Michigan's court of claims. Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said in a statement that the lawsuit demands to review ballots that were opened and counted while the campaign did not have access.
""As votes in Michigan continue to be counted, the presidential race in the state remains extremely tight as we always knew it would be,"" Stepien said in a statement at the time. ""President Trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.
""President Trump is committed to ensuring that all legal votes are counted in Michigan and everywhere else.""
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden defeated Trump in Michigan, pulling in 2,794,853 votes to Trump's 2,646,957, according to unofficial results.
The suit alleged that an election challenger, Eric Ostergren of Roscommon County, was turned away access from an absentee voter counting board in Oakland County.
Another portion of the lawsuit included an affidavit arguing an election worker in Detroit's TCF Center was told to change the date of receipt for an absentee ballot.
Thor Hearne, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said the lawsuit was also seeking for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to issue a directive to election commissioners providing video of remote ballot drop boxes so challengers could see when ballots were delivered.
However, Michigan Judge Cynthia Stephens said during a noon hearing Thursday she would throw the lawsuit out, a decision she solidified in a written order Friday.
The appeal filed Monday, which will likely be re-filed following the Michigan Court of Appeals' response calling it ""defective,"" asked for immediate reconsideration. It claims Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson broke the law by not having bipartisan teams of inspectors present to monitor the absentee ballot counting process.
Poll challengers and election officials who worked at the TCF Center in Detroit counting ballots said there were an even number of challengers present, but noted that some seemed poorly advised as to what they were able to do and some were ""aggressive."""
201,/michigan/detroit/black-voters-biden-couldn-t-have-won-without-us,2020-11-09T01:45:31Z,Black Voters: Biden Couldn’t Have Won Without Us,0,3,Michigan Advance,News Partner,"From :
Black Michiganders say Democratic President-elect Joe Biden owes African Americans a debt of gratitude for his victory over President Trump this week.
""Joe Biden could have not won the presidency without the Black vote in Michigan,"" said Keith Williams, Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus chair. ""Black folks matter.""
U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Biden's running mate, will become the first woman, African American and Asian American to serve as vice president. Her father is Black and was born in Jamaica; her mother was born in India. Both immigrated to the United States.
""I will be honored to be serving with a fantastic vice president — Kamala Harris — who will make history as the first woman, first Black woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country,"" Biden said in his victory speech in Wilmington, Del., Saturday night.
""It's long overdue, and we're reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen,"" Biden continued. ""But once again, America has bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice.""
Williams said that choosing Harris as a running mate made Biden more of an attractive candidate to Black people.
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, the first African American to hold the Michigan post, congratulated Biden and Harris, tweeting, ""It will be an honor to work alongside you for the people of Michigan and our nation.""
Paulette Compass, a Detroit janitor who's African American, organized and rallied for Biden this fall through SEIU, her union. She said that Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was instrumental in causing people to turn to Biden.
""Trump's mishandling of coronavirus that has caused the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives or the economic crisis facing working families,"" said Compass. ""Clearly, our message resonated across Michigan.""
In Michigan, coronavirus has disproportionately affected the African-American community and hit the majority-Black city of Detroit particularly hard during the spring. Black Michiganders make up 14% of the state's population but represent 38% of the state deaths associated with the virus.
Both the Biden and Trump campaigns targeted Black voters, particularly men, during the 2020 campaign, as the Advance reported.
That came after thousands of Michigan residents who cast a ballot in 2012 for Democratic President Barack Obama's reelection did not vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump won Michigan by only 10,704 votes, the first Republican presidential nominee to win the state since 1988.
Nationally, 13% of Black men voted for Donald Trump in 2016, according to CNN exit polls, as opposed to only 4% of African-American women.
In her victory speech, Harris gave a shoutout to her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, and noted the struggles of women — particularly women of color — who came before her.
""Asian, white, Latina and Native American women throughout our nation's history who have paved the way for this moment tonight,"" Harris said. ""Women who fought and sacrificed so much for equality, liberty and justice for all, including the Black women, who are too often overlooked, but so often Prove that they are the backbone of our democracy.""
In Detroit — Michigan's largest city, which is 80% Black — voter turnout was 49% on Tuesday, according to the Detroit city clerk's office. That's 1 percentage point higher than in 2016. That was only 3 percentage points lower than in 2008 when Obama was first elected and became the nation's first Black president.
Rick Blocker, chair of the 14th Congressional District Democratic Party anchored in Detroit, said that Black people were motivated to vote.
""I definitely think we made a difference,"" Blocker said.
The president made a play for Black residents in Detroit, opening an office down the street from Blocker's office. Trump unveiled his ""Platinum Plan"" for Black people backed by celebrities like Ice Cube that included a pledge to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist organization, make Juneteenth a federal holiday and bolster African-American economic prosperity. Juneteenth is a celebration of when Black slaves in Texas learned that African Americans had been freed.
Trump also touted his criminal justice efforts boosted by celebrities like reality star Kim Kardashian West, whose husband, rapper Kanye West, launched a much-hyped independent presidential bid that failed to materialize as a spoiler. At the same time, Trump also trumpeted a strong ""law and order"" message to suburban white women, railed against Black Lives Matter and repeatedly failed to condemn white supremacists and extremist groups like the Proud Boys, who he told to ""stand back and stand by"" at the first presidential debate in October.
For its part, the Biden campaign launched a digital series, ""Shop Talk,"" modeled after National Basketball Association star LeBron James' HBO broadcast ""The Shop"" to talk about issues impacting African American men, like his platform of a $15 minimum wage, police reform, protecting health care for people with preexisting conditions and cutting child poverty.
Harris did several campaign stops across the country, including Detroit, for Black men, and several ads, particularly toward the end of the campaign, were targeted to African Americans and featured Harris. She also spent much of Election Day in Detroit and Southfield, both African American strongholds. Obama and Biden also did a joint events in Flint and Detroit the weekend before the election.
Biden's 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids — amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide, according to the Associated Press.
The former vice president also won Oakland County by 14 points and Kent County by 6 points — both former GOP bastions. In Oakland County, Biden improved on Clinton's 8-point win in 2016. Trump won Kent County by 3 points in 2016.
The Rev. Charles Williams II, National Action Network Michigan chair, said that Black people were not deterred by Trump's voter persuasion and suppression efforts. Rather, they were determined to replace him.
""Democrats owe us. Democrats owe Black America,"" Williams said.
Not all Biden voters in Detroit identified as Democrats, either.
""I'm not a Democrat or a Republican,"" said Angelo Austin, a 24-year-old African American from Detroit. ""I voted for Joe Biden. He was the best guy to get the job done."""
202,/michigan/detroit/black-leaders-greet-biden-win-pledge-push-equality,2020-11-08T05:29:33Z,"Black Leaders Greet Biden Win, Pledge To Push...",0,3,Associated Press,News Partner,"DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden's victory was celebrated by civil rights activists and Black leaders who warned that a tough road lies ahead to address America's persistent inequalities and the racial division that Donald Trump fueled during his presidency.
Biden will take office in January as the nation confronts a series of crises that have taken a disproportionate toll on Black Americans and people of color, including the pandemic and resulting job losses. Many cities saw protests against racial injustice during a summer of unrest.
During a contentious campaign against Trump, Biden made explicit appeals for the support of Black voters. He pledged to unify the country, acknowledged systemic racism, criticized his rival for stoking division and picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket. While those were all welcomed steps, Black leaders and activists say they will keep pushing the incoming administration to do more.
""This is just the beginning of change and the election of any one administration does not mean the work is done,"" said civil rights leader Martin Luther King III, who noted the vision of his father, Martin Luther King Jr., has yet to be fully realized in America, 57 years after he delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. ""Dad and Mom wanted to eradicate poverty, racism and violence from our society and that will take a monumental effort. A Biden-Harris administration has to constantly be challenged and pushed to move.""
Black voters powered Biden's successful campaign, particularly in critical states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. Nine in 10 Black voters nationwide supported him, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 110,000 voters across the country.
""Vice President Biden understands that we are fully formed American citizens who deserve to have full access to all the parts of progress in the United States,"" said Stacey Abrams, a voting rights activist and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate. ""He's been willing to commit not only to plans, but he's been willing to take responsibility for how those plans get lived out. … I want to see proper access to opportunity and I think fundamentally that is the wish, that is the hope, and that is the deserved right of every Black person in this country.""
Latino voters supported Biden over Trump, 63% to 35%, according to the survey. White voters, who made up roughly three-quarters of the electorate, were more likely to support Trump, 55% vs. 43% for Biden.
More than 74 million Americans voted for Biden, more than any other presidential candidate in history. But some Black political strategists and activists noted the 70 million votes for Trump, suggesting that some of those Trump supporters at a minimum turned a blind eye to the racism he demonstrated.
""We have been lullabied for so long in this country that when you have somebody like President Donald J. Trump come along and be so blatant with his racism, it's a shock to the senses,"" said Nina Turner, a Black progressive and former Ohio state senator. ""But this country should not be deluded that it's just Trump, it's millions of people. A lot of white liberals, they're very comfortable with pointing the finger at President Trump. But they need to look in the mirror...because he is just a reflection of what is already a reality in this country.""
While Biden enjoyed strong support from Black voters, there was also frustration about the pressure placed on their communities to deliver a victory.
African Americans, who are the Democratic Party's most loyal voting bloc, face a battle for racial progress in a nation whose very founding embraced racist, predatory systems that continue to disparately harm Black people today.
And America has yet to fully reckon with that racist past, which left generations of Black Americans struggling to achieve the American dream or to overcome the effects of Trump's election in 2016, which many experts saw as a blow to civil rights and race relations.
""We've been here before where we've seen a country that has been deeply divided over race and the complicit role of whites who should be sympathetic to Black interests and issues due to the shared economic fate but they aren't,"" said Nadia Brown, a Purdue University political science professor. ""People will just try to put their heads in the sand because they don't want to be culpable or deal with America's history and its present day. America was founded on the idea of American exceptionalism but structural racism flies in the face of this and even good liberals don't want to hear that.""
In 2016, a coalition composed largely of white voters powered Trump's win over then-challenger Hillary Clinton. At the time, many said they voted for Trump because of his economic plans, which included bringing back manufacturing jobs and auto plants.
But Ashley Jardina, assistant professor of political science at Duke University and author of the book ""White Identity Politics,"" said many white Americans supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 not solely because they are willing to turn a blind eye to racism, but because they outright agree with a lot of his rhetoric and views on race.
""That means many not only fail to see racism as a problem in the U.S., but they also express greater levels of hostility toward people of color,"" Jardina said, noting the views of white Americans on race have increasingly aligned with their political views over the past eight years.
The killings of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed inside her Kentucky home, and that of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly eight minutes, sparked global protests against police brutality and thrust racism in America into an international spotlight.
Those protesters will be looking for Biden and Harris to address their concerns and create progressive policies to address the root causes of police violence, according to Jessica Byrd, who leads the Movement for Black Lives' Electoral Justice Project, and believes Biden and Harris have demonstrated a willingness to engage with the protest movement and organizers.
""Elections are about moving the ball forward and choosing your organizing target,"" Byrd said, adding the movement will pivot toward pushing for legislation and policies like the BREATHE Act, which would transform the nation's criminal justice system and invest in communities. ""We fully intend to show up in the really important days between November and the inauguration and demonstrate our vision for Black lives is real. We have demands of the first 100 days of a Biden-Harris administration.""
Some activists on the ground remain skeptical. In Philadelphia, protests flared in recent days after police shot and killed 27-year-old Walter Wallace Jr.
Longtime activist Abdul-Aliy Muhammad is concerned Biden and Harris won't address the root causes of police brutality, poverty and other structural issues that have long plagued Philadelphia.
""Biden nor Kamala Harris historically have policies that positively impact Black Philadelphians,"" Muhammad said. ""We know with Biden or Kamala Harris in office, we're still going to need to organize and we're going to still have to fight for our material conditions to shift.""
Biden's election also represents hope with the historic candidacy of Harris, who will become the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent, to enter the White House—which some believe will create a ripple effect, opening doors for more women of color and Black Americans to ascend to the highest ranks of American politics.
""Anti-Black racism continues to shape law, culture, politics and more in this country and impact brutally on the lives of Black Americans,"" said Jones, author of ""Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All."" ""And at the same time, I think Senator Harris' ascent to the vice presidency tells us that Black Americans, including Black women, are nonetheless arriving in a new place in the story of American politics.""
Michigan resident Nia Crutcher, who just turned 18 and voted for the first time, represents the next generation of Americans. Crutcher, a Black woman and first-year college student, cast her ballot for Biden.
""I don't think racism will be solved because Biden is elected because it's an issue we need to work on over the years. But I feel that with Biden being elected, there will definitely be more progress,"" Crutcher said. ""I'm hopeful.""

203,/michigan/detroit/detroit-election-workers-describe-aggressive-poll-challengers,2020-11-06T15:36:57Z,Detroit Election Workers Describe 'Aggressive'...,0,7,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"DETROIT, MI — This wasn't Cynthia Duquette's first time working as an election official, but she'd never seen anything like it.
On Election Day, she was one of many people inside the TCF Center in Detroit processing absentee ballots. But the task at hand grew difficult when dozens of people — the majority of whom were supporters of President Donald Trump, upset that large number of absentee ballots favored Democratic candidate Joe Biden — lined up outside the former Cobo Arena, chanting.
Things grew intense inside the arena at times as well, with challengers being ""aggressive"" and not following some procedures. Duquette said she didn't feel threatened or that she was at risk of being harmed, but said she thought the election process was threatened.
""(I felt) that the overall strength and integrity of the American electoral process is threatened by the emphasis on distrust and challenging,"" she told Patch. ""I believe there is a role for challenging, but it should be just one element that is implemented with the mutual trust of those responsible to carry out the election process.""
Duquette had previously worked as a precinct inspector at a polling location with the City of Ferndale for two elections. But after moving to Detroit in 2017, she became involved with the election process there.
The bevy of protesters outside the arena were joined by ballot challengers inside the arena who were aggressive and did not follow some procedures, according to workers inside the arena.
In Michigan, registered poll challengers are allowed to be present. They can stand or sit behind the processing table, can remain in the polling place after polls close and can look over results. But there are many things they are not permitted to do, such as touch or handle election materials, use recording devices or approach voters.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Michigan poll challengers also are required to wear face coverings and keep their distance from others while inside.
Duquette said it was frustrating that organizations that recruited the challengers did ""so little to train them.""
""There were too many instances of challengers talking to workers when they should have spoken only with supervisors, of challengers asking supervisors how to do their job, of challengers not respecting COVID safe spacing,"" she said. ""Any organization placing challengers in the middle of the voting process should take greater responsibility to prepare them to do their work responsibly and respectfully.""
Dozens of activists stood outside the TCF Center Wednesday, chanting ""Stop the count!"" Republican groups recruiting people from around the state to come to Detroit, many of whom were not even from Michigan, according to Michigan Advance.
Detroit police formed a barrier between the protesters and entry ways into the arena, where ballots were being counted.
Protesters appeared upset over Biden's growing lead over Trump, who won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016 but saw a strong lead diminish once absentee ballots and votes from people in Detroit and Wayne County were tallied.
The Associated Press and other media outlets declared Biden the winner in Michigan on Wednesday. Trump in news conferences and on social media called into question the absentee voting process.
""They are finding Biden votes all over the place — in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan,"" he tweeted. ""So bad for our Country!""
The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit to stop election ballots from being counted in Michigan, arguing that challengers weren't allowed to oversee the ballot counting process. But a judge on Thursday dismissed the lawsuit, and those inside the TCF Center say there were ballot challengers for both major political parties. They also said they didn't notice any issues with the counting process.
Chiara Clayton, who was working in her first election after being recruited by the city, said a significant amount of training ahead of Election Day allowed for a smooth process inside TCF.
""We went through 8 hours of training before election week so we were prepared,"" she said. ""The only issues were from some of the poll challengers who were aggressive or combative with the poll workers during the counting process.""
""I did not notice any issues of significance or concern with ballots or the processing procedures,"" Duquette said. ""Any of the very limited number of questions that arose were addressed following defined protocols.""
Melanie Grund, a Democrat Challenger at TCF, said it was uplifting to be a part of the election process, but depressing to see ""the ugly side.""
""How we overcome the chasm between all of us is a conundrum but I simply must believe we can find a path back to the basic respect for our fellow humans,"" she said.
Grund said she did not see or hear of any issues with the counting process, noting that it's ""very detailed"" and has contingencies built into it.
""The elections inspectors, many of whom were doing this for the first time, were well trained and very dedicated to counting every vote accurately,"" she said. ""It is a tedious and laborious process to count AV ballots and it simply takes time."""

Judge Cynthia Stephens said during a noon hearing Thursday she plans to have the written order by Friday. Stephens said the majority of votes have already been counted in Michigan, and that was the key goal of the campaign's lawsuit.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the state is pleased with the judge's ruling.
""She identified the same defects in the campaign's filings as we did, namely a complete lack of any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of election officials, and meritless legal arguments,"" Nessel said of Stephens.

The lawsuit was filed at 4 p.m. Wednesday in Michigan's court of claims. Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said in a statement that the lawsuit demands to review ballots that were opened and counted while the campaign did not have access.
""As votes in Michigan continue to be counted, the presidential race in the state remains extremely tight as we always knew it would be,"" Stepien said in a statement. ""President Trump's campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.
""President Trump is committed to ensuring that all legal votes are counted in Michigan and everywhere else.""
The suit alleged that an election challenger, Eric Ostergren of Roscommon County, was turned away access from an absentee voter counting board in Oakland County.
Another portion of the lawsuit included an affidavit arguing an election worker in Detroit's TCF Center was told to change the date of receipt for an absentee ballot.
Thor Hearne, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said the lawsuit was also seeking for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to issue a directive to election commissioners providing video of remote ballot drop boxes so challengers could see when ballots were delivered.
Trump's reactions on social media and the ensuing lawsuit prompted widespread confrontations and issues on the ground level. In Detroit, videos by people near the TCF Center showed angry gathers outside the center, where votes were being counted. Local police had been called in to line the area and prevent people from entering.
The outside group, in response, chanted, ""Stop the count!"" and ""Stop the vote!""

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Senate Democratic Leader Jim Ananich and House Democratic Leader Christine Greig sent a letter to President Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Kevin McCarthy, asking they pass the bill to help mitigate the coronavirus' economic fallout, provide support for our schools and protect frontline workers, restaurants and small businesses.
""The coronavirus is not only a public health emergency, it is also an economic crisis threatening the livelihoods of our residents and businesses, too,"" the Democratic leaders said in the letter. ""Michigan businesses continue to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, with small businesses especially impacted.
""Any future relief package should also include robust aid to states and localities to help combat the virus, mitigate its economic fallout, and protect essential services.

The leaders also urged the federal government to provide support for Michigan's unemployed workers. According to state data, nearly 3 million Michiganders have applied for unemployment benefits since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 600,000 still receiving benefits.
Those numbers could grow as the number of coronavirus infections rises, officials warned. Coronavirus cases have been on the rise in Michigan, which has reported nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of the respiratory illness and 8,190 deaths attributed to it.

To counter the recent surge in cases, Whitmer, along with state health officials such as Khaldun, announced Sunday new restrictions ahead of Thanksgiving. The restrictions, which include capping indoor residential gatherings to people from no more than two households and limiting outdoor gatherings to 25 people, took effect Wednesday and continue until Dec. 8.
The restrictions have been controversial, with some Michigan Republican officials calling for Whitmer to be impeached. Other Republican officials, however, said this week that would not be considered.

""This morning we are withdrawing our lawsuit in Michigan as a direct result of achieving the relief we sought: to stop the election in Wayne County from being prematurely certified before residents can be assured that every legal vote has been counted and every illegal vote has not been counted,"" Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said in a statement.
It is not yet clear which lawsuit Giuliani is referring to as the Trump campaign has filed several lawsuits throughout Michigan seeking election-related changes.
The Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted to certify the Nov. 3 election results from Wayne County late Tuesday night after a nearly six-hour meeting in which several Detroit residents spoke out against the board's initial decision to note certify the ballots.
Wayne County Board of Canvassers Chair Monica Palmer and William Hartmann — two Republicans who first deadlocked the board's vote to certify election results 2-2 before eventually opting to certify the results under the condition unbalanced precincts are audited — filed affidavits Wednesday night demanding they be able to rescind their votes for certification.
The two members said they were threatened by comments delivered during the public comment portion of the meeting.
""After the vote, public comment period began and dozens of people made personal remarks against me and Mr.. Hartmann,"" Palmer said in her affidavit. ""The comments made accusations of racism and threatened me and members of my family. The public comment continued for over two hours and I felt pressured to continue the meeting without break.""
However, election results in Wayne County are still certified based on the board's vote Tuesday.
Jonathan Kinloch, a Democratic board member of the Wayne County Canvassers, said the board approved a motion waiving reconsideration of the certification.

Gretchen Whitmer to be impeached after issuing safety restrictions amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield shut those calls down.
Chatfield called the effort by Matt Maddock, a state representative who represents parts of Oakland County, a distraction. He added that the idea of impeaching Whitmer is just as ""shameful"" as impeachment efforts against President Donald Trump.
""We're not the party that impeaches someone because we're upset with policies that they've enacted,"" Chatfield said.
Maddock said Whitmer ""crossed the line"" with restrictions she announced alongside state health officials Sunday, which include capping indoor residential gatherings to people from no more than two households and limiting outdoor gatherings to 25 people.
Maddock said five Republican colleagues support his position, according to The Associated Press. Those five Republican have not been named, however.
Chatfield, along with Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clark Lake, have continued, however, to be critical of the governor for her partial shutdown of restaurants, bars, high schools and colleges, as well as limitations on gatherings.

The initial vote Tuesday was along party lines, with Palmer and Hartmann voting against certification while Board Vice Chair Jonathan Kinloch and Allen Wilson, both Democrats, voted in favor of certification.
The board's decision to certify the election results came after Republican members of the board were criticized after a suggestion that all of Wayne County should be certified aside from the city of Detroit.
Palmer said during the meeting she did not have full confidence in how votes were calculated due to a high number of out of balance absentee ballot books and said all votes outside the city of Detroit — where the majority of unbalanced books were found — should be certified.
During the public comment period, several callers had harsh words for the board's decision. The move was questioned as being racially motivated by one board member, considering the city's majority Black population.
""I just want to let you know that the Trump stink and stain of racism that you, William Hartmann and Monica Palmer, have just covered yourself in is going to follow you throughout history,"" local resident Ned Staebler told the board members. ""Your grandchildren are going to think of you like Bull Connor or George Wallace. Monica Palmer and William Hartmann will forever be known in southeastern Michigan as two racists who did something so unprecedented that they disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of Black voters in the city of Detroit.""

Trump took to Twitter to share his dismay with Detroit residents speaking out at the meeting, saying the two dissenting board members were ""forced"" to change their vote.
""At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE (Sad!),"" Trump tweeted. ""Then they were threatened, screamed at and viciously harassed, and were FORCED to change their vote, but then REFUSED, as American patriots, to sign the documents. 71% MESS. Don't Harass!""
Palmer said she felt threatened by some of the statements made during the public comment portion of the meeting.

""The comments made accusations of racism and threatened me and members of my family. The public comment continued for over two hours and I felt pressured to continue the meeting without break.""
Both Republicans reiterated statements made during Tuesday's meeting in their affidavits.
Palmer cited some precincts in Detroit being ""severely out of balance,"" as reported by the county elections director, as being particularly troublesome.
""I fully believe the Wayne County vote should not be verified,"" she said.
In the signed affidavits, Palmer and Hartmann both said they would not have voted for certification had there not been assurance that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson conduct a full audit of out-of-balance precincts.
""I voted not to certify, and I still believe this vote should not be certified,"" Hartmann wrote."

Helen Moore, a retired state social worker, said that she is honored to serve as an official state presidential elector and looks forward to the Dec. 14 meeting in Lansing — but she hopes it is the last such gathering.
""Why can't we just accept the vote as it is?"" said Moore, who would prefer presidents be picked by the popular vote.
Moore, who was voted to serve by her 13th Congressional District Democratic organization colleagues, painfully recalls that former Democratic presidential nominees Al Gore and Hillary Clinton both won more votes than GOP candidates George W. Bush and Donald Trump, in 2000 and 2016, respectively. Bush and Trump, however, secured more Electoral College votes and won the presidency those years.
To be elected president, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 electoral votes cast nationwide.
This year, Democratic President-elect Joe Biden won the popular vote by more than 7 million and has 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232.
The Electoral College process has come under fire by many leaders and experts in recent years. More than 60% of Americans want to change the way we elect presidents, according to a recent Gallup poll.
The Electoral College, which was written into the U.S. Constitution in 1787, is composed of 538 people from across the nation who represent the 50 states and District of Columbia. It exists largely because Constitution framers did not want a nationwide vote to determine the president and for slave-owning states to be disadvantaged.
Electors are chosen and cast a vote for president and vice president. In most cases, they meet at the state Capitol. Michigan has 16 electors, which match the number of senators and U.S. House members it has on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.
In Michigan, presidential nominees from the Democrat and Republican parties submit a list of 16 qualified electors to the Secretary of State's office. The state has a winner-take-all system like 47 other states — whoever wins the popular vote statewide takes all 16 electoral votes.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Nov. 24 signed Certificates of Ascertainment recognizing Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris selection of electors after the bipartisan Board of State Canvassers certified the election on Nov. 23.
If no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the final decision is made by the U.S. House of Representatives. Only two American presidents have been chosen by the U.S. House because they lacked enough Electoral College votes. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson and, in 1824, John Quincy Adams both took office after the election was sent to the House of Representatives.
Unlike in 2000 and 2016, Chris Cracchiolo, Grand Traverse Democratic Party chair, notes that the number of popular votes that Biden received and the number of Electoral College he has been designated are compatible. He will represent the state's 1st Congressional District as an elector.
""I believe that the Electoral College went along with the popular vote,"" Cracchiolo said.

The Task Force's interim report detailed a number of actions Michigan took to increase protections for communities of color, frontline workers and small businesses from the spread of COVID-19. As of Nov. 16, more than 24,000 tests have been administered in previously underserved communities across 21 Neighborhood Testing sites, according to the state.
The state-operated sites provide COVID-19 testing on a consistent schedule, several days per week. All sites offer free testing, and a prescription is not required for someone to be tested, nor is any form of ID required.
""From the beginning, our administration has listened to medical experts and taken a fact-based approach to eliminating COVID-19 in our most vulnerable communities, and we have seen significant progress,"" Whitmer told reporters Thursday during a news conference. ""Our work is far from over, and cases and hospitalizations are still rising statewide, but this team remains dedicated to working with medical experts and protecting our communities, frontline workers, and small businesses. Our immediate focus now is holding our progress, flattening the infection curve, and remaining vigilant with mask wearing and social distancing.""

The state added 6,955 cases of the respiratory illness Wednesday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 373,197. Michigan also reported 81 new COVID-19 deaths, increasing the state's coronavirus death toll to 9,405.
Michigan reported its highest increase in COVID-19 deaths since April on Tuesday. More than 165,000 people in Michigan have recovered from the coronavirus, state health officials said on Saturday.
From March and April to September and October, the average cases per million per day for African American Michiganders dropped from 176 to 59, according to the report. In the same period, the number of probable deaths per million per day among African American Michiganders dropped significantly — from 21.7 to 1.
But the work is far from over, Whitmer said. Next steps include sustaining the progress made and to better addressing ongoing disparities include closing, she noted.
Some of those divides include the digital divide in telehealth and virtual learning to ensure equitable access for all residents.
Increasing enrollment in health insurance plans by making it easy for Michiganders to find out about their options for affordable care, such as Medicaid and federal marketplace plans, is another goal noted by officials Thursday.
Building mobile testing infrastructure that can also be extended for other health services such as vaccine administration, officials said.
Raising awareness of racial- and ethnic disparities in medical care to ensure that every Michigander, no matter their race, can get safe and quality care in Michigan, was also mentioned.
""Now, while we have taken these and a number of other specific actions that are listed in the report, the big takeaway is that more than any particular intervention, it is the prioritizes attention that our state has placed on reducing these disparities in resourcing and protecting these more vulnerable Michiganders that has led to these outcomes,"" Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist said Thursday."

In all, more than 15,000 absentee ballots were rejected for a variety of reasons recorded by election clerks, something Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said is a sign that Michigan's general election was held with integrity.
""I am extremely proud of the 1,600 clerks across the state who embraced the record setting turnout including more than double the number of absentee ballots ever cast in a Michigan election and vigilantly ensured that all valid ballots were counted,"" Benson said. ""It is also gratifying that our voter education efforts, alongside those of countless other nonpartisan organizations, in addition to the installation of secure ballot drop boxes across the state, combined to dramatically reduce the rate of voter disenfranchisement due to late submission and signature errors.""
The 15,300 rejected ballots make up about .46 percent of the 3.3 million absentee ballots returned in Michigan, Benson said. That number is compared to 10,600 rejected ballots in the August primary election.
Benson said the rate of rejection for signature issues fell from August to November, from 0.14 percent to 0.1 percent. The number of ballots that arrived after the deadline of 8 p.m. on Election Day also dropped, from 6,400 in August to 3,300 in November.

That notoriety has, in part, led to her being considered as a potential running mate to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, and she has even been considered for TIME's 2020 Person of the Year.
Most recently, Whitmer's fame has developed into a pop culture reference. In a recent episode of the new ""Saved By the Bell,"" Whitmer is referred to a the ""hottest governor.""
In a clip from the show, posted to Twitter by MLive reporter Dana Afana, fictional character Zach Morris, who is the governor of California, is referred to as the second hottest governor, coming up short to Big Gretch.

""Honey,"" Kelly replies, ""you were voted second hottest governor in America, after Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer.""
Whitmer has also been referenced in other forms of pop culture, such as an episode of the popular comedy show ""Saturday Night Live."" In that episode, which aired in April, characters portrayed her as a beer-loving, protester-fighting governor.

Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association CEO Justin Winslow said his organization is disappointed with Maloney's ruling, but noted the judge acknowledged the irreparable harm the executive order had already dealt to some Michigan businesses.
""It is in that vein that we will now transition our efforts to preventing an extension of the MDHHS Order beyond December 8 and call on Director Gordon to provide clear and specific data to justify the sustained closure of restaurants across the state,"" Winslow said in a statement to Patch. ""Presumptions and generalizations will not suffice and should no longer be tolerated given the significant human toll they have wrought from closing restaurants for a second time this year.
""Moreover, we believe this industry, like any other that has been forced to close, deserves a clear pathway to the full reintegration of their business, with reliable criteria and metrics to be met from Director Gordon to facilitate that reintegration,"" Winslow continued.

Maloney heard arguments from both sides involved in the lawsuit Monday in Kalamazoo. He had asked attorneys representing the state as well as the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association to provide more information before issuing his order, according to The Detroit Free Press.
Attorneys for the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association argued Monday that the restaurant industry was on the verge of collapsing due to the shutdown, and fears that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer could extend the pause after the Dec. 8 shutoff date would be even more crushing, the Free Press reported.
Whitmer announced the restrictions Nov. 15, after the state saw a significant uptick in new cases and deaths stemming from the coronavirus. The order took effect Nov. 18.

Among the restrictions, indoor residential gatherings are limited to two households at any one time, and families are urged to interact with only one other household over the next three weeks.
""This situation has never been more dire,"" Whitmer said during a news conference announcing the restrictions. ""As the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, the virus will spread and more people will get sick and there will be more fatalities.""
The restaurant/lodging group filed the lawsuit Nov. 17. The group's CEO, Justin Winslow, said the group made ""several good faith efforts"" in advance of the order. Winslow said the lawsuit was the ""last available option to prevent the outright devastation of restaurant operators and their hundreds of thousands of employees across the state.""

Whitmer said a decision could come next week, when the initial three-week pause comes to an end. However, the governor did not say how exactly that decision would be made, explaining only that she has been consulting with state and federal health officials.

Whitmer said next week the state will likely have a better understanding of whether the pause worked, and whether residents have followed other guidelines implemented.
""I would anticipate early next week we'll have a much better idea of what this pause has meant,"" she said.
Whitmer announced Nov. 15 that the state would order a three-week pause on indoor dining at eateries across Michigan. The order took effect Nov. 23 and ends Dec. 8. Noting that restaurants have been struggling, Whitmer called on federal legislators to pass a $100 million COVID-19 relief package to assist those businesses.
""The nature of this virus demands that we all work together to protect the people that we serve,"" Whitmer said.
Whitmer said governors from across the country have been urging Congress and the White House to pass a bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill that would provide some assistance to families struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Whitmer said she sent a letter to legislators asking for assistance in Michigan, where more than 360,000 cases of the coronavirus have been reported and over 9,000 people have died.
But leaders at the federal level still have not been able to agree on a plan, Whitmer said.
""It's crucial for us to come together now to pass a targeted state-based economic stimulus plan of up to $100 million that will provide direct financial support to families and small businesses that have been hit hardest by this pandemic,"" Whitmer said.
Michigan is one of many states struggling during the pandemic, Whitmer said. The state is staring at a $1 billion budget shortfall next year, prompting the governor to say hard choices will need to be made about avoiding spending too much on ""non-critical projects"" while focusing funding on residents and businesses.
Whitmer also said Tuesday that she is urging legislators to pass a permanent extension of unemployment benefits. Michigan's maximum $362 weekly benefit for unemployed residents is in the bottom third in the nation and the lowest in the Great Lakes region, Whitmer said. While the state extended unemployment benefits earlier this year to 26 weeks, that extension expires at the end of the year.
""If we don't take this bipartisan action now, thousands of Michiganders who are unemployed can lose benefits right after the holiday,"" she said.
Passing legislation to require masks in public places should be a high priority on both sides of the aisle, Whitmer said Tuesday.
""It would slow the spread of COVID and support our businesses,"" she said."

""Election security and transparency are top concerns for people I represent,"" Hall said in a statement. He said he has received ""thousands of emails and calls"" from people regarding the Nov. 3 election.
""Mr. Giuliani believes there were many problems with how this election was conducted and has alleged that there was significant fraud in Michigan,"" Hall said. ""I am glad we were able to find time to make this work with the president's legal team. This is an opportunity for us to get definitive answers — in-person — about Mr. Giuliani's claims and evidence, while we work to provide clarity and transparency to people who have taken issue with our state's election system.""
Giuliani has appeared in Pennsylvania and Arizona in recent days addressing questions about alleged election irregularities. In the past, the former New York City mayor and prosecutor has said the Trump campaign has identified 300,000 ""illegitimate ballots"" in Michigan, but specifics regarding that evidence has not been backed up.
Wednesday's hearing is a continuation of review of Michigan's Nov. 3 election. The state last week certified the election results in a 3-0 vote, giving Democratic President-elect Joe Biden the state's 16 electoral votes.
Despite election results being certified across the nation, Trump's campaign has continued to file lawsuits with little merit, seeking to halt ballot certification.
Despite GOP leaders claiming various levels of election issues, no proof or significant evidence of fraud have been provided. In the most recent lawsuit filed by GOP groups, the plaintiff — former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell — claimed election fraud was witnessed in Michigan's Edison County. However, there is no Edison County in Michigan.

Gretchen Whitmer has proclaimed Friday as Post Office Day and thanks frontline postal workers who have continued to work throughout the coronavirus pandemic.
The governor said in a news release that Michiganders should take a moment to recognize postal workers, who have worked throughout the entire year and are heading into the busiest delivery season, between Thanksgiving and the start of the New Year.
""This year, our postal workers have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, doing crucial work by delivering Michiganders their prescription medication, election mail and ballots, and other necessities so that others may stay safe at home,"" Whitmer said. ""On this day, we should all take a moment to thank our postal workers for their tireless work to ensure everyone has access to this essential public service.
""We owe it to them and other front line workers to do our part to slow the spread of the virus. Each of us has a role to play by masking up, practicing safe physical distancing, and washing our hands. These steps are what the public health experts say we need to take to avoid overwhelmed hospitals and death counts like we saw in the spring. ""
The United States Postal Service was developed at the Second Continental Congress on July 26, 1775, as the ""United States Post Office,"" where Benjamin Franklin was named as the first postmaster general.
The USPS is the only delivery service that is publicly accessible to all Americans, regardless of their zip code. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, declared the post office as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the government.
The United States Post Office holds a favorable rating from the vast majority of citizens, according to a news release."

Gary Peters Tuesday night after initially contesting Michigan election results.
In a post on his Twitter page, James said it was time for him to congratulate Peters on his victory. James said he would be sending the senator a bottle of scotch — the same brand the two had shared at a Detroit Pistons game previously.
""The 2020 battle for this Senate seat is over,"" James said. ""As we continue to fight for our republic, remember the battle is not ours, but the Lord's. And our enemy is not our fellow Americans.""
Peters has not released a statement regarding James' announcement, but did post to Twitter on Monday — the day election results in Michigan were certified by the state board of canvassers — that the election is final.
""Michiganders made their voices heard in a secure and fair election,"" he said. ""The certification of these results upholds the will of voters in all 83 counties.
""The election is over. It's time to move forward and come together to address the pressing challenges we're facing.""
The race between James and Peters shattered fundraising records in Michigan, with the total spending between the two campaigns potentially topping $100 million, according to Michigan Advance.
The change caught the attention of Trump, who called into question the ballots.
""Wow! It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate,"" he tweeted. ""What a terrible thing is happening!""
James initially joined Trump in questioning the validity of ballots, but his tone changed earlier this week, when he posted a video on Twitter saying that a review of election results would likely not change the results of his race but could reveal other issues.
""Congratulations, sir,"" James told Peters in his most recent message. ""I wish you and your family good health and safety this season and in the new year."""

By certifying the results, the state board of canvassers, a four-person panel comprised of two Republican and two Democratic members, confirmed that the state's 16 electoral votes go to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who won Michigan by 154,000 votes over President Donald Trump.
More than 21,000 people tuned in to the meeting on YouTube, which was held remotely from a room inside the Michigan Capitol building with socially distanced board members due to COVID-19 health guidelines. Over 500 people signed up for public comment, board members said.
No one from the public attended the meeting in person.
Board chair Jeannette Bradshaw, a Democratic, Republican Vice-Chair Aaron Van Langevelde and Democrat Julie Matuzak voted in favor of certification. Norman Shinkle, a Republican, abstained from the vote.
Shinkle said ahead of the vote he was going to vote against certifying the results until an investigation is completed. Had the board not certified Monday, the task of doing so would have moved to the Michigan Supreme Court.
Prior to his vote, Shinkle said said he would ask for a full legislative review of the elections process. Other board members agreed some processes would benefit from a review.
The meeting lasted roughly 4 hours, including input from the public through Zoom.
Jenna Ellis, an attorney working with the Trump campaign, said the board's vote was strictly procedural.
""We are going to continue combatting election fraud around the country as we fight to count all the legal votes,"" she said in a statement. ""Americans must be assured that the final results are fair and legitimate.""
A slew of Democratic officials in Michigan expressed their approval of the vote on social media.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said the board's vote ""confirms the truth: the election was fair secure, and the results accurately reflect the will of the voters.""
""Now we turn to the important work of implementing a statewide risk limiting audit & local procedural audits to affirm the integrity of the vote & identify areas for improvement,"" she added. ""We will continue working w lawmakers to strengthen our elections even more in the months ahead.""
Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer thanked clerks around the state as well as Benson for their work.
""The people of Michigan have spoken,"" she said. ""President-elect Biden won the State of Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, and he will be our next president on January 20th.""
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she commended the board members for certifying the results.
""A record number of citizens turned out to vote in an election that was fair, secure and transparent,"" she said. ""It is now the responsibility of every official and leader in this country to ensure that the will of the voters is heard. The Board's actions today did exactly that in Michigan and I appreciate and respect their courage under these historic circumstances.""
Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey thanked board members for their vote and said the state senate will honor it.
Michigan Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater began the meeting by reading a statement to the board recommending that they certify the results. He also commended election workers around the state for their work on Election Day, calling much of the criticism regarding Election Day processes as ""unfair.""
Brater said there were no widespread election issues discovered during the county certifications of Michigan's 83 counties. Some irregularities that were reported in Wayne County were not uncommon and the November election was an improvement over past elections in Detroit, Brater said.
Christopher Thomas, Michigan's former state director of elections, answered questions from board members, saying Detroit — the state's largest city— has seen significant improvement in elections procedures since 2016.
Thomas, who helped as a special advisor to Detroit in November, said the city is by far the state's largest elections operation, and that staff has reported improvements for accuracy. Thomas said there is work still to be done, but that efforts are being made to continue improving.
Shinkle asked Thomas under what circumstances the board could adjourn and delay certifying the results, saying anyone who says the election went smoothly is being inaccurate.
Thomas responded by saying that, if the board has all of the material necessary, he didn't think they could adjourn.
""What would you be waiting for?"" he retorted. ""There's no reason to sit on it for 40 days. … What would you do for 40 days? You don't have the authority to do an audit, so what would you do?""
A slew of elections clerks from around the state spoke during the meeting, urging the board to certify the results of the election.
Livonia city clerk Susan Nash said she would be in favor of an audit, but in order for that to take place the board of canvassers would need to certify the results.
Michelle Anzaldi, the elections clerk in Pittsfield Township, also asked the board to certify the results so ""we can begin the audit process.""
Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum said it is the job of the board of canvassers to certify the results, which have previously been certified at the county level. Byrum called Shinkle's decision to vote against certification ""shocking and disgusting.""
""It is the job of the 83 county canvassers, not the state, to certify the votes in their jurisdiction,"" Byrum said.
Michigan GOP Chair Laura Cox implored the board to delay their vote in order to execute a full audit of election results prior to certification. Cox also said that Republican challengers were disrespected at the TCF Center, where absentee ballots were counted.
""I will continue to stand up for republicans and demand that they be respected,"" she said.
In interviews with election workers at the TCF Center following the election, workers told Patch that Republican challengers were ""aggressive"" and uninformed of rules surrounding the process.
What has seemingly been an overlooked and mundane portion of past elections, all eyes were aimed at the Michigan State Board of Canvassers for this go-around following a six-hour canvasser meeting in Wayne County that featured board members first deadlocking on whether to certify results before ultimately approving certification.

The concern voiced by Republican canvassers in Wayne County surrounded Detroit, where about 70 percent of absentee vote counting boards are out of balance without explanation, according to The Detroit News.
Balanced precincts mean the number of ballots counted matches the number of ballots recorded in the poll book as well as the number of ballots tabulated by a counting machine.
Another concern was that there weren't Republican poll workers present at all 134 absentee counting boards in Wayne County, but Dan Baxter, a former director of elections for Detroit, said they could not get enough GOP recruits for those positions.
Michigan's elections agency had said that, even if verified, the claimed irregularities in places such as Wayne County would not significantly affect the outcome. The Michigan Democratic Party said the total number of Detroit votes implicated by imbalanced precincts is at most 450, or ""0.029% of the margin"" separating Biden from Trump.
Republican members of the board were criticized after a suggestion that all of Wayne County should be certified aside from the city of Detroit. During the public comment period, several callers had harsh words for the board's decision.
The move was questioned as being racially motivated by one board member, considering the city's majority Black population. But discrepancies are common, and Detroit was far from the only area to have out of balance numbers, Democratic board members pointed out.

221,/michigan/detroit/detroit-extends-outdoor-dining-program-help-businesses,2020-11-23T13:23:13Z,Detroit Extends Outdoor Dining Program To Help...,0,0,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"DETROIT, MI — The city of Detroit has announced an extension of its outdoor dining program to support restaurants impacted by the new coronavirus indoor dining restrictions.
The new dining program, Open Detroit, was announced by the city Monday. The pilot program initially launched in June 2020 to help support the safe reopening of restaurants offering sit-down dining. City officials said that since response to the program has been so favorable among restaurant owners and patrons, coupled with the new restrictions on indoor dining, the city decided to extend the program through the winter.
The winter edition of Open Detroit will kick off Dec. 1 and go through April 1.
""Our local restaurants continue to face challenges as a result of COVID-19 related restrictions on sit-down dining capacity,"" DPW Director Ron Brundidge said. ""With these restrictions continuing into the cold weather months, the extension of the Open Detroit program will give businesses an opportunity to service patrons in a safe manner. Our hope is that restaurants take advantage of this opportunity, and most importantly that residents safely support these businesses.""
The program allows for sidewalks, on-streets parking spaces and private parking lots to be temporarily converted for uses such as seating, expanded outdoor dining areas and retail space.
The city has also designated a select number of Café & Retail Zones, where the city will close selected portions of an entire street. These zones provide the maximum space to serve businesses in a concentrated area, and will be installed 24 hours per day/7 days per week, for the duration of the program. Social distancing requirements as well as ADA clearances must be followed.
Enclosed outdoor seating is permissible as long as tents only have one side of the tent down. ""Igloo"" style seating is allowed but must only sit one household at a time.
Permits for the summer outdoor dining program are set to expire on Nov. 30. All restaurants looking to apply for the winter program must apply online, including current summer permit holders."
222,/michigan/detroit/michigan-leader-trump-didnt-ask-election-interference,2020-11-23T02:41:17Z,Michigan Leader: Trump Didn't Ask For Election...,0,14,Associated Press,News Partner,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) — President Donald Trump did not ask Michigan Republican lawmakers to ""break the law"" or ""interfere"" with the election during a meeting at the White House, a legislative leader said Sunday, a day before canvassers plan to meet about whether to certify Joe Biden's 154,000-vote victory in the battleground state.
House Speaker Lee Chatfield was among seven GOP legislators who met with Trump for about an hour on Friday, amid his longshot efforts to block Biden's win.
""There was this outrage that the president was going to ask us to break the law, he was going to ask us to interfere, and that just simply didn't happen,"" he told Fox News of the highly unusual meeting. He did not elaborate on what was discussed, except to say the delegation asked for additional federal aid to help Michigan's coronavirus response.
Michigan's elections agency has recommended that the Nov. 3 results — including Biden's 2.8-percentage point victory — be certified by the Board of State Canvassers, which has two Democrats and two Republicans. The Republican National Committee and the state Republican Party want the board to adjourn for 14 days to investigate alleged irregularities in Wayne County, the state's largest and home to Detroit.
Staff for the state elections bureau said that claimed irregularities, even if verified, would not significantly affect the outcome. The Michigan Democratic Party said the total number of Detroit votes implicated by imbalanced precincts — where the number of ballots does not equal the number of names on the pollbook — is at most 450, or ""0.029% of the margin"" separating Biden from Trump.
""The certification process must not be manipulated to serve as some sort of retroactive referendum on the expressed will of the voters. That is simply not how democracy works,"" chairwoman Lavora Barnes wrote to the board on Sunday.
If the board does not confirm the results and the Michigan Supreme Court does not subsequently order it to do so, Chatfield said ""now we have a constitutional crisis."" He and other Republicans, however, have indicated that they would not undermine the voters' will.
""Michigan election law clearly requires that the state's electors must be those nominated by the party that received the most votes — not the Legislature,"" says a stock email House Republicans are sending in response to people who contact their offices.
Experts on Michigan election law have said the state board's authority is limited in scope and that it must certify the results now that all 83 counties have reported theirs to the state. There is concern, though, because Trump personally called the two Republicans on Wayne County's board last week and they said a day later that they were rescinding their previous vote — following an earlier deadlock — but it was too late.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Republican who met with Trump, suggested in a Sunday tweet that the state canvassers might ""take the full time allowed by law to perform their duties"" instead of voting Monday and said ""it's inappropriate for anyone to exert pressure on them.""
The deadline is Dec. 13, but that is five days after the federal ""safe harbor"" date — when Congress cannot challenge any electors named by that date in accordance with state law.
There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed that there were no serious irregularities.
The issues Trump's campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election.
Republican U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan's current longest-serving member of Congress, told CNN on Sunday that ""the voters spoke"" and the state had no razor-thin presidential race.
""No one has come up with any evidence of fraud or abuse,"" he said. He called the request to delay the certification ""out of bounds.""
The trip to the White House has come under heavy scrutiny. The lawmakers stayed at the luxury Trump International Hotel, and two of them were photographed with expensive drinks at the hotel bar after the meeting.
Spokespeople for Shirkey and Chatfield said the legislators covered their expenses and that no taxpayer money was used. However, they did not say if the men paid for the trip themselves or if it was paid for in some other way such as by them tapping into their nonprofit ""administrative"" accounts that can accept contributions from corporate or other donors.
Finding out about who runs such lawmaker-connected organizations, who donates to them and what the money is spent on can be extremely difficult, according to a 2016 joint investigation by MLive and the Michigan Campaign Finance Network. Such accounts can be used to reimburse legislators for travel.

After Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake), House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R-Levering) and other GOP lawmakers visited the White House Friday, President Donald Trump said their meeting went differently than how it was reported by the media.
That reporting was largely based on a press release issued from the Republican leaders' offices that emphasized they asked for more COVID-19 relief in the meeting.
The meeting came while the Trump campaign is still pushing for the election to be overturned in key states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia, which Democratic President-elect Joe Biden won. Trump reportedly has invited Pennsylvania GOP lawmakers to visit the White House next.
On Saturday morning, the president responded to Shirkey's tweet where he shared he and Chatfield's joint statement, and added: ""This is true, but much different than reported by the media. We will show massive and unprecedented fraud!""
Shirkey spokesperson Amber McCann said the Senate majority leader has no comment on the president's tweets.
Trump also responded to Chatfield's tweet, adding, ""massive voter fraud will be shown!""
Chatfield has not yet publicly responded yet to the president's tweets and his spokesperson did not respond to a request to comment.
The statement was shared just minutes after the Friday meeting concluded. There has been no formal readout of the meeting, so it's unclear what was discussed. But the two Michigan Republican leaders said the meeting focused on their letter to the president asking for more federal relief funding for COVID-19 in Michigan.
They vaguely mentioned the election process in the statement, writing:
""The Senate and House Oversight Committees are actively engaged in a thorough review of Michigan's elections process and we have faith in the committee process to provide greater transparency and accountability to our citizens. We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan's electors, just as we have said throughout this election.
""Michigan's certification process should be a deliberate process free from threats and intimidation. Allegations of fraudulent behavior should be taken seriously, thoroughly investigated, and if proven, prosecuted to the full extent of the law. And the candidates who win the most votes win elections and Michigan's electoral votes. These are simple truths that should provide confidence in our elections.""
The statement did not state that Biden won, although he did win Michigan by more than 150,000 votes.
The Detroit News reported that Sens. Aric Nesbitt (R-Lawton), Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), Shirkey and Chatfield were spotted leaving the Trump International Hotel Saturday morning.
Other Michigan lawmakers that were reported to be in D.C. Friday along with the Republican leaders were House Speaker-elect Jason Wentworth (R-Farwell), Sen. Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway Twp.) and Rep. Jim Lilly (R-Park Twp.).
Photos of Chatfield and lawmakers drinking in the Trump Hotel Friday night were shared with the Advance, Politico and others. Large photos of the lawmakers' faces also were projected on the side of the hotel, as well as ""voters decided"" and ""the world is watching."" Chatfield has made the image of him his Twitter cover photo.

It is unclear who is paying for the Republicans' plane travel, hotels, drinks and meals during the Washington trip. Republican spokespeople have not returned requests for comment. The Advance asked Attorney General Dana Nessel's office about possible legal issues with that.
""We can't comment on any pending investigations,"" said Nessel spokesperson Kelly Rossman-McKinney, adding: ""That is our official statement on all things election-related right now.""
Progress Michigan Executive Director Lonnie Scott bashed Chatfield after photos circulated of him drinking in the Trump Hotel following the White House meeting.
""After pretending his and Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey's White House meeting was focused on COVID relief, House Speaker Lee Chatfield was photographed maskless, drinking with colleagues at Trump hotel in clear violation of the D.C. mask ordinance,"" Scott said. ""Chatfield and Shirkey want Michiganders to believe that they met with President Trump to discuss combating the COVID crisis. Clearly, Chatfield isn't concerned enough to take actual precautions to protect the servers and staff around him.""
""Chatfield should get out of the bar and back to work to pass much-needed public health policies, like the mask mandate Gov. Whitmer has repeatedly asked the legislature for,"" Scott added.
Biden is to be awarded the state's 16 electoral votes under Michigan's winner-take-all system. The Legislature, according to the law, doesn't have a role in the post-election process, like certifying election results or appointing electors. Some Democrats remain concerned about interventions, although Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer can veto laws passed by the Legislature.
The Board of State Canvassers, which is split evenly between two Democrats and two Republicans, is scheduled to meet on Monday and is supposed to certify statewide results, which have been certified by all 83 counties.
In a sign that Republicans are not yet giving up on pro-Trump maneuvers, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox on Saturday wrote a joint letter to the Board of State Canvassers asking them to adjourn for two weeks without certifying the state's election.
""On behalf of the Republican National Committee (""RNC"") and Michigan Republican Party (""MRP"") , we encourage the Board to grant the request made by John James for Senate, Inc. (""James Campaign"") and adjourn for fourteen days to allow for a full, transparent audit of Wayne County's 2020 General Election results,"" McDaniel and Cox wrote.
Notably, bipartisan election lawyers, who on Friday were part of a League of Women Voters of Michigan conference, agreed that the board legally must certify the election results on Monday.
""Their duties are to receive and certify. That's it,"" said John Pirich, a Michigan State University law professor and longtime GOP election lawyer. ""There is no reason to delay.""
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson plans a post-election audit, but that can only begin after the state board certifies the results.
The Republicans' letter comes after the Wayne County Board of Canvassers on Tuesday certified the Nov. 3 presidential election results, but only after they first deadlocked along partisan lines when the two Republicans on the board, William Hartmann and Monica Palmer, refused to certify. Wayne County includes Detroit, a Democratic stronghold that's 80% Black.
After they were bashed during public comment, the two Republicans reversed their decision and agreed to certify the results. However, they were called by Trump and then signed affidavits that they wanted to ""rescind"" their votes, which the Wayne County Commission attorney said was illegal.
Several Michigan Republicans are holding strong to the unproven claims that there was widespread fraud in the Wayne County election, although court cases alleging problems have been thrown out, conspiracy theories have been debunked and problems have proven to be small, clerical issues.
McDaniel and Cox are echoing James, the GOP U.S. Senate nominee who also has refused to concede to U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) and asked the board not to certify the statewide election results without an audit.
Peters won the election by 92,000 votes.
""It would be a grievous dereliction of this Board's duty to the people of Michigan not to ensure that the irregularities identified by the James Campaign are thoroughly investigated by a full audit before certifying Wayne County's results,"" the two Republican party chairs wrote.
The four-member body has two Democratic appointees and two Republican appointees. Jeannette Bradshaw, a Democrat who is recording secretary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 58, chairs the body. Aaron Van Langevelde, a Republican attorney who works for the House GOP caucus, is vice chair. The other two members are Norman Shinkle, chair of the Michigan Republican Party's 8th Congressional District committee, and Julie Matuzak, a Democrat who was elected to the Macomb County Board of Commissioners.
Shinkle has told media he's leaning against certification. The other Republican, Aaron Van Langevelde, is a policy advisor and staff attorney for the House Republican caucus run by Chatfield, who took the meeting with Trump on Friday."

Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey (R-Clarklake) and House Speaker Lee Chatfield (R-Levering) said that the group of Michigan lawmakers who met with President Donald Trump Friday used the rare one-on-one time with the president to advocate for more federal COVID-19 funding to the state.
The White House visit came amid the Trump campaign reportedly pursuing a plan of overturning election results in key states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia won by President-elect Joe Biden. Legal experts and Democrats raised concerns about the legal and ethical implications of such a meeting.
Neither Trump nor Republicans addressed reporters after the meeting. Trump has yet to tweet or issue a statement.
While the Republican leaders didn't share details about the conversation they had with the president on the topic of the election process in Michigan, they wrote they had ""not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan's electors.""
The Trump campaign has continued to push misinformation and conspiracy theories about the soundness of Michigan's election, which has now been certified in all 83 counties. Biden holds a lead of about 155,000 votes.
Trump still has not conceded, even though the election has been called by media outlets for Biden since Nov. 7.
The Board of State Canvassers, which is split evenly between two Democrats and two Republicans, will meet on Monday and is supposed to certify statewide results. However, at least one Republican, Norm Shinkle, has told media he's leaning against certification. The other Republcian, Aaron Van Langevelde, is a policy advisor and staff attorney for the House Republican caucus run by Chatfield.
""Michigan's certification process should be a deliberate process free from threats and intimidation. Allegations of fraudulent behavior should be taken seriously, thoroughly investigated, and if proven, prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" Shirkey and Chatfield wrote. ""And the candidates who win the most votes win elections and Michigan's electoral votes. These are simple truths that should provide confidence in our elections.""
However, attorney Mark Brewer, a former Michigan Democratic Party chair, who has been critical of Republicans' post-election actions, tweeted: ""Actions speak louder than words: if Speaker @LeeChatfield means what he says here, his employee who serves as 1 of 2 @migop members on the Board of State Canvassers will uphold his oath of office and do his clear legal duty by voting to certify the election results on Monday.""
Many Democrats were critical of Shirkey and Chatfield's trip to the White House, but the two Republicans said they were proud to accept the invitation.
""The President of the United States extended invitations to us on Wednesday evening. We each accepted his invitation as we would accept an invitation from any sitting President if asked to meet at the White House,"" they said. ""We were proud to be joined by our colleagues to represent Michigan in our nation's capital.""
Shirkey and Chatfield were joined by other Michigan Republican legislators, though the leaders' spokespeople did not share who was present for the meeting with Trump.
Multiple media outlets have reported they were joined in Washington, D.C., by House Speaker-elect. Jason Wentworth (R-Farwell), Sen. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), Sen. Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway Twp.), Sen. Aric Nesbitt (R-Lawton) and Rep. Jim Lilly (R-Park Twp.).
""We used our time in the White House to deliver a letter to President Trump making clear our support for additional federal funds to help Michigan in the fight against COVID-19,"" Shirkey and Chatfield wrote in a statement Friday evening. ""We highlighted our commitment to appropriating further federal dollars to Michiganders most in need as we continue to deal with the impact of COVID-19. We also emphasized our commitment to fiscal responsibility in the state budget as we move forward.""
However, neither of the Republican leaders signed on to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's letter to Trump Thursday asking that leaders in Washington, D.C. pass the long awaited COVID relief bill as cases climb exponentially in Michigan and around the country.
In their own letter to the president, Shirkey and Chatfield wrote that although they were asked to sign on to Whitmer's letter, they felt it was ""important to represent our position distinctly from the governor's.""
""We regret that we were unable to endorse the governor's correspondence in its entirety, but we are willing to work with the governor, Michigan's congressional delegation and leaders in Washington to ensure our citizens receive the help they need to endure this difficult time in our state's and our nation's history,"" they wrote.
The Republicans said that the state needs to avoid another ""round of government-mandated shutdowns"" and they would hurt businesses. They said that instead ""elected leaders should work to inspire, inform and educate individuals about the importance of personal behaviors and responsibility when it comes to reducing the spread of COVID-19.""
In the letter, they requested federal aid for health care systems and frontline workers, unemployment benefits and relief for Michigan businesses.
""We can assure you that we will do what is necessary to meet our constitutional obligations to pass a balanced state budget,"" Shirkey and Chatfield wrote in their letter.
They added that they do not believe the state will need a federal bailout to fill the state's budget deficit due to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.
Whitmer and many Democrats have been making the case to the White House for months that Michigan needs another round of federal funding to help better address the pandemic.
In recent months, the state has seen a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. On Friday, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported a total of 295,177 Michiganders have tested positive for COVID-19 and 8,377 have died from the virus."

During a small but spirited rally on Saturday in Detroit at the Joe Louis fist, Anthony Cardamone said it's time for President Donald Trump to give up election lawsuits, concede to Joe Biden, and ""get out!""
""[Trump] needs to concede now, so we can undo the damage that he's done,"" Cardamone of Clinton Twp. said.
The rally was part of a coordinated effort by RefuseFascism.org to demonstrate in cities throughout the country. Efforts were scheduled on Saturday in New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Honolulu, Houston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle.
President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, won Michigan over Trump, a Republican, by about 150,000 votes, according to unofficial returns. Biden is to be awarded the state's 16 electoral votes under Michigan's winner-take-all system. However, Trump's campaign has charged that election fraud occurred in Michigan and other states. The campaign has filed multiple lawsuits in Michigan that have been either dismissed or withdrawn.
""Massive voter fraud will be shown!,"" Trump tweeted on Saturday. Twitter tagged the post with a disclaimer ""This claim about election fraud is disputed.""
The Michigan Board of State Canvassers, which is split evenly between two Democrats and two Republicans, is scheduled to meet on Monday and is supposed to certify statewide results, which have been certified by all 83 state counties.
The state Legislature, according to the law, doesn't have a role in the post-election process, like certifying election results or appointing electors. Some Democrats remain concerned about interventions, although Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, can veto laws passed by the Legislature.

Duggan, 62, announced his intention to run for reelection at a virtual news conference that was prefaced by a video that included several endorsements from well known figures locally, including Wayne County Commissioner Warren Evans and Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, the city's former health office director.
""Big city mayors last one term, maybe two, because the strain of the job these days,"" Duggan said in his announcement news conference. ""Politics is so rough, so brutal. It beats them down. But (Detroit residents have) made this job a joy, and I still want to come to work every single day.""

Duggan first ran for the mayoral position in 2012. Initially, Duggan did not qualify to make the ballot because he filed less than a year after becoming a city of Detroit resident. But Duggan still won 52 percent of the vote in the August primary through a write-in campaign.
In the general election, Duggan garnered 55 percent of the vote en route to becoming the city's first white mayor since 1974.
Duggan won his first reelection campaign in 2017.
In his reelection news conference, Duggan touted his success at bringing business and jobs to the city — particularly for Detroit residents and people of color.
""What I'm really proud of is a lot of Detroiters, and a lot of entrepreneurs of color are opening these businesses,"" he said. ""That's what we want to make sure. We want to make sure these opportunities aren't just made for those of the outside, because I wasn't elected by the 200,000 people who left in the decade before I got here. I was elected by the people who stayed.""
Wednesday's reelection campaign announcement came just after Duggan announced a moratorium on water shutoffs in the city, something that he said is funded by state, federal and philanthropical money.
""My goal now is stop water shutoffs to low-income Detroiters once and for all,"" Duggan said. ""We have secured the funding necessary to continue this effort through 2022 and we are building a coalition to make this permanent."""

The moratorium on water shutoffs due to an inability to pay was first launched during the pandemic and has been funded through state, federal and philanthropic funds, Mayor Mike Duggan said.

Detroit has spent $22 million in payment assistance and major plumbing repairs for several thousand residential homes since the moratorium began in March, the city said. Officials did note that 92 percent of residents pay their water bills.
Abdul El-Sayed, a former public health director in Detroit said he supports the extended moratorium and is working to identify long-term funding options. The city is also working with cities across the U.S., calling for water affordability funding.
""This is a victory for the city, it's residents, and the advocates who've been leading on this effort for years,"" El-Sayed said. ""And to achieve it, we're going to need to align advocates with state and federal lawmakers and City leadership to find the funds. All of us against water shutoffs.""
Thousands Have Water Turned Back On In Detroit
Since March 9, water service has been restored at 1,300 homes in Detroit, DWSD Director Gary Brown said. Detroit has set aside sufficient state, federal, private, and local funds to continue the moratorium on water service interruptions even after the health departments orders end on Dec. 31, officials said.
By the end of December, $22 Million is expected to be spent, $15 Million of which has been for bill credits to nearly 50,000 Detroit households. DWSD has 227,000 active residential accounts, according to data provided by the city.
""The water shutoff moratoriums issued by health departments end in 23 days,"" Brown said. ""We have chosen to ensure that residential households that do not have the ability to pay have the resources for help and maintain service through at least 2022 while we work on permanent water affordability solutions at the state and federal levels. The infrastructure is in place through DWSD and our community partners to continue to provide compassionate and effective customer affordability programs to financially insecure Detroit households, now and through the implementation of long-term solutions.""
Detroit Looks For Permanent Funding To Prevent Future Shutoffs
The COVID-19 Water Restart Plan, the CARES Act and Michigan Senate Bill 690 provided temporary relief during the pandemic, but the next step is to work on a permanent solution for water affordability, officials said.
Duggan said he hopes Detroit will be a leader at the state level and nationally.
""The federal government currently actively prevents gas and electric shutoffs of low-income Americans through the Low Income Heating Assistance Program,"" Duggan said. ""But there is no comparable program for water bills. We're going to be part of a national coalition to support the efforts of Senator Gary Peters to extend utility shutoff support for water.""
Detroit has joined a coalition of cities from around the country, including Seattle, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Alexandria, Baltimore, Louisville, Sacramento and Washington, D.C. to create a policy platform on national water affordability initiatives focusing primarily on low-income water assistance program and include plumbing repairs."

But Dana Nessel, Michigan's attorney general, called the lawsuit a ""publicity stunt,"" and not a serious legal pleading.
""The erosion of confidence in our democratic system isn't attributable to the good people of Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia or Pennsylvania but rather to partisan officials, like Mr. Paxton, who place loyalty to a person over loyalty to their country,"" Nessel said in response to the lawsuit. ""The Michigan issues raised in this complaint have already been thoroughly litigated and roundly rejected in both state and federal courts — by judges appointed from both political parties. Mr. Paxton's actions are beneath the dignity of the office of Attorney General and the people of the great state of Texas.""
Paxton's lawsuit seeks a ruling that would call for election results in the mentioned states unconstitutional and stopping the respective states from choosing their electors based on popular vote.
The lawsuit said Michigan — as well as other key battleground states Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which were won by Democratic President-elect Joe Biden — flooded residents with unlawful ballot applications and ballots while ignoring requirements regarding how they were received, evaluated and counted.
""Trust in the integrity of our election processes is sacrosanct and binds our citizenry and the States in this Union together,"" Paxton said. ""Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin destroyed that trust and compromised the security and integrity of the 2020 election.""
Michigan's decision to mail absentee ballot applications to voters was announced early this year by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. The decision was criticized by President Donald Trump, but upheld by two state courts.
Paxton further argued that the states violated statutes as well as the Constitution, tainting the integrity of ""their own citizens' vote.""
""Their failure to abide by the rule of law casts a dark shadow of doubt over the outcome of the entire election,"" Paxton said.
In addition to Nessel, other Michigan officials spoke out about Paxton's lawsuit. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was one of them.
""This lawsuit seems to suggest that the voters of Michigan messed with Texas,"" Benson tweeted Tuesday. ""They didn't. Case closed."""

Using an approach deeply rooted in neighborhood-level engagement, the Race2Equity program organizes trainings, helps creates community action plans, advocates for residents at decision-making tables and mediates community discussions and conflict, the group said in a news release.
Wendy Lewis Jackson, managing director of The Kresge Foundation's Detroit Program, said the foundation is proud of the work the roundtable has done.
""We value the Michigan Roundtable's decades of accomplishments and experience bridging sectors and communities to create leverage for sustainable change,"" she said.
The Kresge Foundation grant is just the latest in a series of funds awarded to the Roundtable in 2020. In June, the Consumers Energy Foundation gave the organization a $35,000 grant. In October, JPMorgan Chase Bank pledged $22,000 grant for the same efforts. In July, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation awarded a $200,000 grant to the Roundtable to facilitate the revitalization of neighborhoods within the 48208 Lives project in Detroit through racial equity and social justice. The investment in the Roundtable's work in Zone 8 began with a generous $100,000 grant from the Ford Foundation in November of 2019.
""We're dedicated to continuing our momentum in light of the changing climate,"" said Steve Spreitzer, president and CEO of the Roundtable. ""A deep sense of repairing the world is in our ethos.

The additional 12 days will allow the department to determine the full impact of the Thanksgiving holiday on the spread of COVID-19 across Michigan, officials said during a news conference Monday.
The order means families are urged to avoid indoor gatherings, and only two households may gather inside. People should wear masks consistently whenever they are inside with people not in their household, officials said, and are recommended to pick only a small group to see regularly.
""(These restrictions) follow the recommendations of medical experts from across the country,"" Whitmer said Monday during the news conference announcing the extension. ""They are targeted and temporary, and they are steps that the experts are telling us we need to take to avoid hospitals that are overwhelmed and death counts like we saw in the spring.""

Whitmer announced the restrictions Nov. 15, after the state saw a significant uptick in new cases and deaths stemming from the coronavirus. The order took effect Nov. 18.

Among the restrictions, indoor residential gatherings are limited to two households at any one time, and families are urged to interact with only one other household over the next three weeks.
A Michigan restaurant/lodging group filed a lawsuit Nov. 17 seeking to remove the ban, but that lawsuit was rejected Wednesday by a Michigan judge.
Attorneys for the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association previously tried to get the court to grant a temporary restraining order, seeking to see an immediate stop to the ban before a formal ruling was issued on the lawsuit. However, a judge on Nov. 20 struck down that request.
Bars and restaurants must remain closed for dine-in service, but can remain open for outdoor dining, carry-out and delivery. Gyms are open for individual exercise with mandatory masking and additional strict safety measures. Casinos, movie theaters and group exercise classes remain closed. Professional and college sports meeting extraordinary standards for risk mitigation may continue without spectators. Colleges, universities and high schools will continue with remote learning, with no in-person classes.
Whitmer told business owners Monday that she understands their struggles, and thanked them for doing their part in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
""I want you to know I understand the incredible sacrifices that you've made this year in order for us to help save people's lives, and I appreciate you,"" she said. ""We've made progress.""
Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association CEO Justin Winslow said he isn't surprised by the extension, but that he and the agency remain ""exceptionally disappointed.""
""We firmly believe there is a better approach — one followed by 45 other states — that doesn't use blunt force closure of a single industry to resolve a shared crisis,"" Winslow said in a statement to Patch. ""We maintain that a more nuanced approach that allows for limited indoor capacity with a curfew will result in greater compliance, better health outcomes and substantially reduced economic fallout.""
Winslow said that once the new order is completed, restaurant dining rooms will have been closed for 118 days — nearly one-third of the year. He also noted that the industry has lost over $8 billion in sales and has laid off more than 75 percent of its workforce.
""The restaurant industry is comprised of creative and resilient individuals, but for a growing number of them, this latest pause is the cause of their lost livelihood and well-being,"" he said.
The order will keep existing measures in place through Dec. 20 and does not include a blanket stay-home action. Employees who work in jobs that cannot be performed from home can continue to go to work, including those in manufacturing, construction and health occupations. Outdoor gatherings, outdoor dining and parks remain open.
Individualized activities with distancing and face masks are still allowed, such as shopping, public transportation, restaurant takeout, personal-care services such as haircuts and individualized exercise at a gym, with extra spacing between machines.
Michigan health officials said three key metrics have been identified in determining whether to slowly reopen at the end of the 12-day extension. Those metrics were described as the percentage of hospital beds with COVID patients, the number of COVID-19 cases and the positivity rate.
With improvements in those numbers in context, MDHHS will carefully reopen, with in-person learning at high schools first, officials said Monday. Next in line will be entertainment venues where people can maintain consistent masking, such as casinos, theaters and bowling, with concessions closed."

Google's anticompetitive behavior has unlawfully maintained the company's monopoly on internet search and search-based advertising at the expense of consumers, Nessel's office said in a news release. Nearly 90 percent of all internet searches in the U.S. are on Google, leaving consumers with little choice other than to accept its less popular privacy practices and data collection policies.
""Google's alleged aggressive and anticompetitive business practices have allowed it to solidify its grasp on the market and stifled competition to the detriment of consumers,"" Nessel said in a statement Thursday. ""By monopolizing the internet search functions used by so many, and the lucrative advertisements that are tied to it, the company has established significant control over what marketing products are being pushed out to consumers, the search results users are presented and, most importantly, the data those users have – in some cases, unwittingly – provided.
""This is an unlawful practice that must be corrected to provide the market with competitive alternatives to improve search-engine capabilities for the benefit of consumers.""
The lawsuit alleges that in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, Google pays billions of dollars each year to device makers like Apple and Samsung, and to carriers like AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, to make Google their default internet search engine. Some of those contracts prohibit similar agreements with competing search engines, according to a news release.
Google is the preinstalled default search provider on all Apple devices and on virtually all devices running the Android operating system, among others. On mobile devices, Google's exclusionary agreements cover more than 80 percent of all U.S. search queries.
Even for search queries not covered by Google's exclusionary contracts, almost half occur on Google-owned search access points, such as Chrome, its browser, or Pixel, its smartphone, Nessel's office said."

In a letter sent to state House Oversight Committee Chairman Matt Hall, R-Marshall, on Tuesday, Benson said she was declining the invitation out of concern that they are ""amplifying already debunked conspiracy theories and previously disproven claims of people who lack basic knowledge of election administration, and in doing so undermining the integrity of the election and wounding our democracy.
""Since this election was settled and has been found to be conducted fairly and accurately, I look forward to having a conversation with any willing lawmakers about reforms and improvements we can make going forward for future elections, with an eye towards making data-driven decisions and implementing solutions to ensure all citizens can have rightly placed faith in the results of our elections as an accurate reflection of the will of the people,"" Benson responded in her letter.
The validity of the Nov. 3 General Election has been called into question multiple times by the campaign of President Donald Trump, who lost in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. Recently, several Republican leaders both in Michigan and in across the nation acknowledged that Biden had won the presidency.
Benson noted that Attorney General William Barr, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and local election clerks on both sides of the aisle, as well as judges and justices appointed by Republicans and Democrats, have found the election was secure and the results are accurate.
To date, no credible evidence of widespread election fraud has been discovered, according to state and federal investigators. There have been, however, irregularities discovered that both Democrats and Republicans have said need to be addressed in future elections.
Benson criticized the panel for a prior hearing, in which President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, ""proceeded to spout false and baseless accusations against Michigan public servants - including more than 1,600 election clerks and tens of thousands of election workers,"" she said.
""He called Wayne County's chief judge, a Republican appointee, a ""hack"" and suggested various individuals should be prosecuted based on zero evidence of wrongdoing,"" Benson said of Giuliani. ""Just prior to the hearing this same attorney suggested that you and your colleagues would be threatened if you did not act as he would like and overturn the outcome of the election, despite the fact that Attorney General William Barr, the FBI and CISA have confirmed its security and accuracy.
""Indeed, the hearing was deemed such an embarrassment, lacking in merit and any form of decorum, that it was mocked on national comedy shows as a clear waste of taxpayer dollars,"" Benson added.
Hall responded to Benson Wednesday with a letter of his own, saying she said she would be willing to testify ""when it made a good talking point for her and got her good press.""
""But when the rubber met the road and it came time to answer questions about her work, she refused to take questions,"" he said. ""Benson's flip-flop makes it clear she would rather hide under a rock than help the people of Michigan build trust in their state's election process going forward."""

It is our responsibility as leaders to follow the law and move forward in pursuit of policies that contribute to the betterment of Michigan.""
At the same time as Shirkey's statement, Michigan Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield, a Republican, said in a statement said while he was personally disappointed that the election results went the way they did, ""I love our Republic, too,"" in response to suggestions that Republicans interfere with the Electoral College process and attempt to retroactively change how electors are chosen.
""That's unprecedented for good reason,"" he said. ""And that's why there is not enough support in the House to cast a new slate of electors. I fear we'd lose our country forever. This truly would bring mutually assured destruction for every future election in regards to the Electoral College. And I can't stand for that.""

Monday's Electoral College vote began shortly after 2 p.m. when state officials met at the Michigan Capitol. When it was announced that Biden was received the 16 votes, many of those in attendance stood and cheered.
The Electoral College is comprised of 538 electors who cast one vote per person for president and vice president, according to Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Michigan has 16 electors to reflect the number of senators and representatives it has in the U.S. Congress.
A candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 electoral votes cast nationwide to be elected president, according to Benson's office. If no candidate receives 270 votes, the final decision is made by the U.S. House of Representatives — something that has been done twice previously in U.S. history.
Trump was ahead early on in Michigan, carrying a lead into early Wednesday morning. But as election officials across the state continued counting ballots, including a large number of absentee and mail-in ballots, the state's totals slowly turned blue.
The way the election turned out, with an influx in absentee voters due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, prompted GOP officials and Trump's campaign to allege widespread fraud across the nation and, in particular, Wayne County and Detroit.
There has been no evidence of large scale election fraud in the Nov. 3 General Election, federal and state officials have maintained. On Monday, Michigan's top Republican official said the state's Senate oversight committee has failed to find evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 election.
""President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris won Michigan's presidential election,"" Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said.
The Michigan Board of Canvassers on Nov. 23 voted 3-0 to certify the state's Nov. 3 election results. By doing so, the panel confirmed that the state's 16 electoral voters would go to Biden.
One member of the board abstained from the vote, asking for an audit of election results. Benson has said several times the state would undergo an extensive audit.
However, the assurances of a post-election audit and lack of evidence relating to claims of election fraud have not settled the Trump campaign. A bevy of lawsuits has been filed in Michigan as well as across the nation, nearly all of which have been dismissed or rejected for lacking merit.
Some right-wing groups have taken matters into their own hands as well, with armed protests at the homes of Michigan election officials. Those protests, along with prior armed protests at Michigan's Capitol, prompted the state to take additional safety measures ahead of Monday's Electoral College vote.
On Friday, state authorities said the electors would have a police escort from the vehicles to the state Capitol in Lansing ahead of the vote. The state also closed all government buildings — including closing off the Capitol to the public — Monday due to ""credible threats of violence.""
A Michigan lawmaker was punished Monday after he said he could not guarantee there would not be violence Monday. Republican Rep. Gary Eisen, R-St. Clair Twp. was removed from his committee assignments after saying he couldn't promise Monday would be safe in a radio interview regarding the Electoral College vote in Michigan.

The agency said the state's Improved Workforce Opportunity Wage Act of 2018 doesn't allow for scheduled minimum wage increases to take place when Michigan's annual unemployment rate for the preceding year is above 8.5 percent.
The current rate was expected to increase to $9.87 an hour.
The state's 2020 annual unemployment rate, which is determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Dept. of Labor, is calculated by using both average labor force and unemployment levels for January through December.
While Michigan's October unemployment rate continued its downward trend and is 5.5 percent, the agency said the annual average from January through October currently sits at 10.2 percent and is highly unlikely to dip below the 8.5 percent threshold when BLS releases the final 2020 unemployment numbers for Michigan.
If the annual unemployment rate does not fall below 8.5 percent, officials said the state's minimum wage rate of $9.65 will continue while the 85 percent rate for minots will remain $8.20 an hour.

The 16 electors have been assured they will receive a police escort from the vehicles to the state Capitol in Lansing ahead of the vote Monday, according to The New York Times.
The report comes after a group claiming there was widespread fraud committed in the Nov. 3 General Election said it would protest the Electoral College vote from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday.
That group — Stop the Steal — has already held protests across the nation claiming that the 2020 Presidential Election was stolen from President Donald Trump despite Biden winning the election both in electoral and popular votes.
In Michigan, Biden won by more than 154,000 votes. Armed Stop the Steal protesters last week showed up at the home of Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and shouted obscenities at her from outside until police arrived.

There has been no evidence of large scale election fraud in the Nov. 3 General Election, federal and state officials have maintained.
Demonstrations outside the Capitol building often include armed protesters because Michigan is an open carry state, something that has taken place more than once throughout the coronavirus pandemic as residents protested restrictions implemented by Michigan's Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

Numerous attempts by the Trump campaign to delay and overturn the Nov. 3 election results have thus far been dismissed. Each lawsuit filed by Republicans in Michigan seeking to overturn results has been rejected. Meanwhile, the Michigan Board of Canvassers certified the state's election results in November.
Following the election certification in Michigan, Benson said the state would undergo an extensive audit.
""Now we turn to the important work of implementing a statewide risk limiting audit & local procedural audits to affirm the integrity of the vote & identify areas for improvement,"" she said at the time. ""We will continue working w lawmakers to strengthen our elections even more in the months ahead."""

240,/michigan/detroit/michigan-joins-suit-accusing-facebook-creating-monopoly,2020-12-10T14:08:00Z,Michigan Joins Suit Accusing Facebook Of...,0,1,Joey Oliver,Patch Staff,"The Federal Trade Commission, with bipartisan support from attorneys general in Michigan and dozens of others, filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal court Wednesday against social media giant Facebook.
In the suit, the FTC accuses the company of illegally dominating the social media industry and eliminating business threats through years of monopolization and anti-competitive conduct.
According to the complaint, Facebook has used a ""systematic strategy"" over the years to eliminate threats to its business. This includes the company's acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and mobile messaging app WhatsApp in 2014, both of which were perceived as an ""existential threat to Facebook's monopoly power.""
The lawsuit also alleges Facebook has limited third-party software developers' access to interconnections to its platform, allowing access only after developers ""refrain from developing competing functionalities, and from connecting with or promoting other social networking services.""
As a result of its actions, the lawsuit alleges, Facebook has seen ""staggering"" profits. Last year, Facebook generated revenues of more than $70 billion and profits of more than $18.5 billion.
The complaint states that Facebook's actions have not only harmed competition but also left consumers with few choices for personal social networking and deprived advertisers of the benefits of competition.
With the suit, the FTC is seeking an injunction in federal court that could require Facebook to divest its assets, including Instagram and WhatsApp, and require Facebook to seek prior approval for future mergers and acquisitions.
""Personal social networking is central to the lives of millions of Americans,"" Ian Conner, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said in a release. ""Our aim is to roll back Facebook's anti-competitive conduct and restore competition so that innovation and free competition can thrive.""
The lawsuit was filed following an investigation by the FTC's Technology Enforcement Division.
Attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia and Guam comprise the bipartisan coalition that signed on in support of the lawsuit.
""Facebook's power as a monopoly has been solidified through its methodical erosion of any and all viable competition in this arena,"" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said. ""My colleagues and I seek to protect consumers and their data by ending Facebook's illegal, anticompetitive conduct and prevent this type of predatory behavior in the future."""
