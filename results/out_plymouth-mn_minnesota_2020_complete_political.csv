May 1, 2020
""Governor Tim Walz has extended Minnesota's stay home order (PDF) until Monday, May 18 while ""safely adjusting the dials"" towards reopening the state, including allowing retail businesses to begin offering curbside pickup.
Your efforts are allowing Minnesota to manage the effects of COVID-19 by adding healthcare capacity, securing personal protective equipment and increasing testing capabilities while taking steps to reopen sections of the economy.
Residents should continue to practice social distancing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
Proud to Live in Plymouth
As we navigate this unprecedented situation, I continue to be proud of Plymouth residents and their resiliency. As new challenges develop, our residents face them head on.
For example, in the statewide mask drive last weekend, more than 2,477 homemade cloth masks were collected at Plymouth fire stations to distribute to local congregate living facilities. We also continue to hear from residents, asking how they could help.
Thank you for adhering to the stay home order and for practicing social distancing. This gets tougher as the days go by, but it's important to continue on this path so we can return to normal while mitigating the impact of the virus.
Business Resources and Support
The City of Plymouth Economic Development Division is working to help businesses facing challenges. A good starting point for those facing difficulty is the city's Coronavirus Business/Employee Resources webpage, which contains a list of available resources. The webpage is updated as resources become available.
Small brick and mortar businesses in Plymouth can also reach out to Economic Development Manager Danette Parr at dparr@plymouthmn.gov if they need help connecting to resources.
I also encourage residents who are able to support Plymouth restaurants. Visit the Restaurant Takeout and Delivery Links webpage to find a list of restaurants offering delivery, takeout or curbside pickup. Now more than ever, our businesses are relying on loyal customers and support from the community.
Additionally, it has been a point of great pride to see Plymouth's many med-tech and med-tech support companies continue to play an important role in the pandemic response. The innovation and ingenuity of Plymouth's business community has been on full display.
Staying Safe Outdoors
With the warmer weather, Plymouth residents are turning to parks, trails and roadways for fresh air and exercise. While we encourage residents to get outdoors, please be careful and considerate of others – and continue to practice social distancing.
Please be aware of what is happening around you. As residents practice social distancing, some take wider paths around others on trails, cross roadways to maintain distance, or walk, bike and run in areas they normally would not. Be safe, and please practice responsible use of Plymouth's parks.
Continuing the Path
This is an unprecedented challenge for all of us. It doesn't seem fair and it won't go away easily, but Plymouth is a strong community, and we can get through this together – even as we stay home.
I'd like to finish by sharing my sincere gratitude for health care workers, first responders, custodial staff and everyone who continues to work on the front lines of this pandemic – thank you for all you do.""

April 10, 2020
""This week, Governor Tim Walz extended Minnesota's stay-at-home order until Monday, May 4 and expanded the definition of essential jobs. In doing so, he also shared some hopeful news. Our collective efforts are working. We are slowing the spread of the coronavirus – giving Minnesota time to focus on response, recovery and resources. Thank you, Plymouth for doing your part.
Overwhelmingly, Plymouth residents are rising to the occasion. As mayor, I know that community members and businesses are experiencing hardship. And at the same time, I see residents extending themselves to others. Acts of kindness and care, large and small, are on display daily – and each gesture helps create a caring community.
Thank you for abiding by the stay-at-home order, practicing social distancing and limiting trips to those that are essential. Your actions are protecting the most vulnerable – and showing respect and concern for the health care providers and first-responders who are on the front lines of the pandemic.
I am confident Plymouth residents will continue to do the right thing during this extended stay-at-home period.
Use Parks Responsibly
Getting outside is especially important during this stressful time. Help protect those in our community who are most vulnerable – please use parks and trails responsibly.
The health of the community depends upon each person being committed to doing the right thing. Residents should follow social distancing guidelines, avoid using playgrounds and not congregate in groups.
Parents, explain to your children the crucial role they play in keeping themselves and others healthy.
Support Local Restaurants
During the next few weeks, if you are able, help support Plymouth restaurants. To make it easier for the community to find which establishments are open, the city has published a webpage that lists restaurants available for delivery, curbside pickup and takeout.
Plymouth restaurants and businesses are relying on loyal customers now more than ever.
Find Time for Gratitude
This situation is requiring all of us to slow down. While it certainly has its frustrations, it can also be a time to focus on what we truly value and appreciate.
As mayor, I'm grateful for Plymouth residents who make sacrifices, put others first and practice social distancing. And I'm thankful for city staff who have practiced pandemic readiness for many years and are now working the plan – they've got this.
In my job as a commercial banker, I am grateful to have the chance to help many small businesses obtain federal loans that help keep employees on the payroll.
P­­ersonally, I'm keenly aware of how thankful I am for my faith, the health of my loved ones and the extra time I'm spending with my wife of 34 years.
As we embark on the next leg of this unprecedented journey – returning to normal as soon as we safely can – I hope you and your loved ones stay well and find time to recognize and show gratitude to others.""

April 1, 2020
April 1 is Census Day, and every single Plymouth resident is asked to participate in the count to ensure that the city is fully represented.
The census is held nationally every 10 years with the goal of counting every person in the United States. April 1 is recognized as Census Day to encourage participation.
Why it Matters
Census results have far-reaching public policy effects. In 2016, Minnesota received more than $15 million from federally-funded programs based on 2010 census data. That's $2,796 per Minnesotan each year – or nearly $28,000 over 10 years. These funds support education, healthcare, transportation, housing and other vital programs.
Additionally, officials have projected that Minnesota is at risk of losing one of its eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. An accurate and complete count that reflects Minnesota's population growth over the last decade could help retain that seat.
How to Be Counted
All households were mailed an invitation to participate, which provides details about options to complete a census form – online, by phone or through the mail. You do not need to have your invitation to respond – simply go to 2020census.gov to get started. The census is 10 questions long and takes about 10 minutes to complete per household member.
Residents should note that, by law, the U.S. Census Bureau cannot share respondents' answers with anyone, including other federal agencies and law enforcement entities.
Help Others Be Counted
Please share this information, as there are certain populations who tend not to complete the census.
People historically undercounted include:
People who need help completing the census can text questions to 662020. More information about the census in Minnesota is available on the state's census webpage.

March 24, 2020
For the health and safety of residents and Hennepin County staff, and as a precaution aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, the Plymouth Open Book Meeting set for Wednesday, April 15 has been canceled. For homeowners with questions, the Hennepin County assessor offers alternate options, including virtual valuation and classification reviews.
Market value notices for Plymouth properties arrive in mailboxes toward the end of March. The notices list the value of the property and its classification for taxes payable in 2021. Property values affect how much tax residents pay each year.
Options for Residents
Hennepin County appraisers are conducting virtual valuation and classification reviews without face-to-face contact. Plymouth homeowners with questions or concerns may call the assessor's office to schedule a conversation regarding their property.
The Hennepin County Board of Appeal and Equalization meeting is scheduled for June 15, 2020 at the Hennepin County Government Center. Notice will be given by June 1, 2020 on the Hennepin County website if the meeting will be held by telephonic or other electronic means.

State Rep. Sarah Anderson, of Plymouth, said she was punched in the arm Sunday by a man after telling him to stop kicking her campaign sign.
When she confronted the man, a self-described anarchist, he told her she should kill herself, according to Anderson. He later punched her when she tried to get a photo of him, the representative said.
""The idea that they will physically attack me, that is un-Minnesotan, that is not how we operate, and that's not how we solve problems in the state,"" she told KMSP.
Plymouth police is investigating the incident. The allegation comes after Shane Mekeland told the Benton County Sheriff's Office he was punched in the face at a bar.
Mekeland said he suffered a concussion from the alleged attack.

Erik Paulsen holds a sizable lead over Third District challenger Terri Bonoff, according to a news poll released Oct. 17. In a KSTP/SurveyUSA poll, Paulsen leads Bonoff 49 percent to 38 percent, while 13 percent remain undecided.
A focus of Bonoff's campaign has been to tie Paulsen to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. In her first ad of 2016, Bonoff didn't mention her opponent but did go after Trump. The poll released Monday indicates the effort to tie Trump to Paulsen has not worked so far.
""Democrats have not been successful in equating Paulsen with Trump,"" said Carleton College political science professor Steven Schier.
""It's clear that 3rd District voters are making a big distinction between those two people.""
In the same poll, Trump trails Hillary Clinton among ""likely voters"" in the 3rd District by 13 points.
""This poll was conducted during a time when the national press was saying there's a meltdown of the Trump campaign,"" Schier added.
""But what we see in this poll is there's no meltdown of the Paulsen campaign.""
Bonoff and Paulsen will participate in their second debate on Sunday, Oct. 30 at 6:30 p.m., live on KSTP.

Susan Allen (DFL-62B) has introduced a bill that would prohibit licensed therapists from trying turn gay youth straight.
Reparative therapy or conversion therapy is a pseudoscientific treatment that aims to change sexual orientation. The country's major mental health and pediatric associations have all said homosexuality is not a mental disorder or something that needs to be cured. The American Psychological Association says conversion therapy has ""no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations.""
Allen said conversion therapy practitioners aren't as overt as they once were but that the treatment is still widespread.
""If you look at over the period of the last five years, they've sort of changed the way they advertise their services,"" Allen told Capitol Report host Julie Bartkey. ""It's not as obvious anymore that some of the Christian, sort of, based mental health services that offer this type of therapy. It's just sort of given that it's part of their family therapy. So it is prevalent, and it is a nationwide problem.""
Minnesota's best known conversion therapy practitioner is Marcus Bachmann, the husband of 6th District Congresswoman Rep. Michele Bachmann. In 2011, Marcus Bachmann acknowledged that therapists in his Christian counseling business will offer conversion therapy to those who want it—although he said the practice, which was renamed Counseling Care in December, is not focused on converting gays to heterosexuality.
Said Allen: ""It's a practice that's been discredited. There's 40 years of research.""
If passed, Allen's law would apply only to licensed practitioners and the prohibition would only be in effect for minors. The state licensing boards would be responsible for monitoring and discipline.
""We don't dictate the terms of what the discipline should be, but we do deem it that it is prohibited and that it is something that needs to be regulated,"" Allen said.
Minnesota would not be the first state with such a ban. California passed a law banning so-called gay aversion therapy. Critics sued, alleging that the law violated free speech and parental rights. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that the law regulates ""professional conduct, not speech."""

The Eden Prairie legislator has introduced a bill that would remove a ban on Sunday liquor sales. If the bill passes, liquor stores would be able remain open Sundays, although local communities could set the hours and rules for liquor sales.
Loon, the deputy minority leader, released the following statement Monday announcing the bill:
""The time has come for state government to abolish this outdated law and move the decision closer to the people. While local governments should have the final say in how these sales are controlled, our citizens and businesses deserve a less restrictive regulatory climate that invites competition, creates jobs and brings fundamental freedom back to our communities. While I understand and appreciate some of the concerns raised by opponents of Sunday sales in the past, none of our neighboring states ban off-sale liquor sales on Sunday, and Minnesota is one of only 12 states nationwide with such a law. I have worked with both Republicans and Democrats who are ready to make this small but important change to our state statutes and enhance our economic competitiveness.""
Sunday liquor sales have been a long-running controversy in Minnesota. Some critics worry that Sunday sales would be hard on small businesses, while others say residents don't need another day to buy alcohol. But supporters argue that the state ban takes power away from business owners and local communities and causes Minnesota businesses to lose out to neighboring states.

Rep. Joe Atkins (DFL-District 52B)—whose district includes all or parts of Eagan, Inver Grove Heights and Mendota Heights—wants to require a ""kill switch"" on smart phones. The switch would allow people whose phones were stolen to go back to their home computer and disable the phone.
""You turn it into basically a paperweight—which means it no longer has any value, and that's what's prompting criminals to steal these devices,"" he told Capitol Report host Julie Bartkey.
Atkins cites Federal Communications Commission statistics saying that nearly one in three robberies across the country involve smart phones.
""Not only was it a monetary (thing)—it's like $30 billion now across the country—but they've become so violent,"" he said. ""It used to be that they'd snatch your phone and take off. Now they're hitting people over the head. They're beating them up. And then they're stealing their cell phone.""
Twin Cities residents got a visible example of this violence when thieves attacked former Hennepin County commissioner and Minneapolis mayoral candidate Mark Andrew.
Andrew was at a Mall of America Starbucks when someone stole his phone. When he chased down the thief, two female teenagers attacked him, one with a metal baton. He was able to hold onto them until police arrived, but he emerged from the robbery bloody.
There has been a string of robberies of electronic devices—such as smart phones, tablets and computers—elsewhere, including some incidents near the University of Minnesota. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has warned residents to be careful when using the devices in public spaces.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar has also called on manufacturers to build kill switches into their phones.
""Mobile devices aren't just telephones anymore – increasingly people's livelihoods depend on them,"" a Dec. 30 statement quoted Klobuchar. ""That's why we need to do more to crack down on criminals who are stealing and reselling these devices, costing consumers billions every year. The wireless industry needs to step up to the plate and address these thefts, and make sure consumers have the most advanced security technology at their fingertips."""

The Internal Revenue Service announced plans to open the 2014 filing season Jan. 31 and encouraged taxpayers to use e-file or Free File as the fastest way to receive refunds.
The new opening date for individuals to file their 2013 tax returns will allow the IRS adequate time to program and test its tax processing systems. The annual process for updating IRS systems saw significant delays in October following the 16-day federal government closure.
""Our teams have been working hard throughout the fall to prepare for the upcoming tax season,"" IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel said. ""The late January opening gives us enough time to get things right with our programming, testing and systems validation. It's a complex process, and our bottom-line goal is to provide a smooth filing and refund process for the nation's taxpayers.""
The government closure meant the IRS had to change the original opening date from Jan. 21 to Jan. 31, 2014. The 2014 date is one day later than the 2013 filing season opening, which started on Jan. 30, 2013 following January tax law changes made by Congress on Jan. 1 under the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA). The extensive set of ATRA tax changes affected many 2012 tax returns, which led to the late January opening.
The IRS noted that several options are available to help taxpayers prepare for the 2014 tax season and get their refunds as easily as possible. New year-end tax planning information has been added to IRS.gov this week.
In addition, many software companies are expected to begin accepting tax returns in January and hold those returns until the IRS systems open on Jan. 31. More details will be available in January.
The IRS cautioned that it will not process any tax returns before Jan. 31, so there is no advantage to filing on paper before the opening date. Taxpayers will receive their tax refunds much faster by using e-file or Free File with the direct deposit option.
The April 15 tax deadline is set by statute and will remain in place. However, the IRS reminds taxpayers that anyone can request an automatic six-month extension to file their tax return. The request is easily done with Form 4868, which can be filed electronically or on paper.
IRS systems, applications and databases must be updated annually to reflect tax law updates, business process changes and programming updates in time for the start of the filing season.
The October closure came during the peak period for preparing IRS systems for the 2014 filing season. Programming, testing and deployment of more than 50 IRS systems is needed to handle processing of nearly 150 million tax returns. Updating these core systems is a complex, year-round process with the majority of the work beginning in the fall of each year."

Paulsen—whose district includes Eden Prairie, Edina, Maple Grove, Minnetonka, Plymouth and several Lake Minnetonka communities—toured the brewery with Lucid Co-owner Jon Messier and the owners of Bad Weather Brewery and Badger Hill Brewery, which share the facility with Lucid.
The Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce (BREW) Act, which was introduced by Reps. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) and Richard E. Neal (D-MA) on Feb. 5, would halve the excise tax on the first 60,000 barrels—from $7 to $3.5 per barrel—and institute a new rate of $16 per barrel on beer production from 60,000 barrels up to 2 million barrels. Breweries that produce 6 million barrels or less annually would see a savings from the tax breaks.
Small BREW Act supporters say the bill would help an industry that's become a significant part of the state's economy. In 2012, Minnesota's 143 brewers and beer wholesalers contributed to 34,760 jobs, paid $665,400,000 in taxes and had a total economic impact of about $4 billion, according to the Beer Institute.
 ""The brewery started with two employees, my partner Eric Biermann and me,"" a release quoted Jon Messier. ""In two years we have grown the business to having ten full-time employees and six part-time employees. As a small company we are always looking to hire talented people to help us grow the brewery. A reduction in Federal taxes allows us to do this. We'll be able to hire more employees at competitive wages and offer benefits to existing employees that we could otherwise not afford.""

The following is a list of some of those new laws:
Many juvenile court records and proceedings are already closed to the public. A new law affects records stemming from hearings in which a 16- or 17-year-old has been charged with a felony. Those records are currently public even if an initial felony charge is later reduced or dismissed.
The new law limits access only to electronic court records. It will not affect public access to hearings or paper records. The law also makes exceptions that maintain public access to electronic records in certain cases involving serious offenses, unless the prosecutor agrees otherwise.
Rep. Carly Melin (DFL-Hibbing) and Sen. Ron Latz (DFL-St. Louis Park) sponsor the legislation.

Estate sale operators will be required to guarantee their clients at least $20,000 prior to agreeing to conduct an estate sale.
The new law, sponsored by Rep. Linda Slocum (DFL-Richfield) and Sen. Barb Goodwin (DFL-Columbia Heights) is the first to regulate estate sales by requiring operators to offer a surety bond. Certified public accountants and licensed attorneys, however, are exempt.

Home sellers must disclose radon gas testing
A requirement for home sellers to disclose radon testing is one of the major provisions contained in the omnibus health policy law sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Laine (DFL-Columbia Heights) and Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville).
Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, and one in three Minnesota homes pose a risk from the odorless, tasteless gas, said Laine. The law will not mandate testing or mitigation, rather, a Department of Health radon awareness brochure will be given to the 40,000 annual homebuyers across he state at the point of sale. If the seller has knowledge of radon in the home, that information must be disclosed to the buyer. The so-called Radon Awareness Act also requires the seller to hand over records pertaining to radon testing or mitigation of the residence, if available.
There are some exclusions to the disclosure requirement, such as property transferred due to divorce, foreclosure, death of a family member or when no money is transferred.

Under current law, the state emergency response center or a firefighting or law enforcement organization must be notified when a reportable quantity of a hazardous or extremely hazardous substance is released or spilled. There is no requirement to notify local jurisdictions.
Sponsored by Rep. Dan Schoen (DFL-St. Paul Park) and Sen. Katie Sieben (DFL-Newport), a new law requires the state emergency response center to notify a local 911 emergency dispatch center within 24 hours of the notification, unless ""the situation requires an immediate response or the area is unknown to the center."" Then, the state emergency response center shall direct the caller to contact local authorities.

Since 2009, state law has banned a public employer from inquiring whether a job applicant has a criminal record or criminal history at the time a person applies for a job.
Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Bobby Joe Champion (DFL-Mpls) sponsor the so-called Ban the Box law, which will add private employers to those who must wait until an applicant is selected for an interview to ask the question.
The law will remove the question that asks job applicants to check a box about whether they have ever been convicted of a felony or gross misdemeanor. For jobs that don't include an interview, employers cannot ask about criminal issues until there is a conditional offer of employment.
Employers who violate the new law within the first year will be subject to a written warning after their first offense, followed by cash penalties for any subsequent violations.

An estimated 40,000 additional low-wage earners and their families may qualify for Medical Assistance coverage as a result of a new law that extends coverage to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, including a standard 5 percent income disregard, or about $15,000 per year.
Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) and Sen. Kathy Sheran (DFL-Mankato) sponsor the law that allows the state to exercise its option under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to expand Medical Assistance.
The federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost for adults without children who qualify through 2016. Beginning in 2017, the federal government will gradually reduce that support to 90 percent of the cost for 2020 and subsequent years.In addition to the newly eligible, thousands of people currently enrolled in the state-offered MinnesotaCare health insurance program are expected to shift to the expanded Medical Assistance program. The law transfers about $63.6 million from the Health Care Access Fund to the General Fund in the 2014-15 biennium to cover the cost of insuring some MinnesotaCare enrollees who are not eligible for the full federal funding under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Chuck Wiger (DFL-Maplewood) sponsor a new law that aims to expand licensing and regulatory provisions as they relate to scrap metal and scrapped vehicle purchases.
While Aug. 1, 2013, was the effective date for much of a larger law to prevent stolen cars from quickly becoming scrap metal, scrap vehicle operators must install and maintain video surveillance cameras at their operations, effective Jan. 1, 2014. Additionally, still digital cameras or similar devices must be positioned to clearly photograph the face of each seller of a scrap vehicle who enters the location. The scrap vehicle operator shall also photograph the seller's vehicle, including license plate. Any video must be shown to law enforcement, upon request.

Benson Decides Not To Seek Fifth...,0,0,Becky Glander,Patch Staff,"State Representative John Benson (DFL), who represents Minnetonka, Plymouth and Woodland in House District 44B announced Wednesday that he will not be seeking re-election to the Minnesota House of Representatives. 
Rep. Benson was first elected in 2006 and will be completing his fourth term in the Legislature.
A little while later on Tuesday, Jon Applebaum, a local attorney, entrepreneur and DFL activist, announced his campaign for the seat.
""Representing the citizens of my community has been a great personal honor,"" Benson said in a news release. ""I have viewed these past eight years in our citizen's legislature as an opportunity for me to help improve Minnesota's quality of life and then to return to private life.""
Rep. Benson, a retired teacher, made education a priority in his service in the legislature. He said after serving out his term he will continue to find ways to contribute to the common good as a private citizen.
Applebaum said he is running for state representative because he wants Minnesota to be the best state in the country, and ""I believe that starts with improving our state government."" 
""It has been a pleasure getting to know Representative Benson over the past year and I cannot thank him enough for his great service to our district and to Minnesota,"" Applebaum said in a news release. ""His counsel and encouragement of my campaign have been extraordinary. I look forward to build upon his work and would be honored to serve the community in which I was raised.""
In the coming months, Applebaum will work to earn the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party endorsement.
Applebaum is a real estate consultant at a company he founded.  He also serves as Of Counsel to a growing law firm located in the western suburbs of Minneapolis. He is a graduate of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee and the University of Minnesota Law School. "

To honor these—and other—efforts, the Department of Natural Resources named Minnehaha Creek its ""Watershed District of the Year.""

Minnehaha Creek has partnered with St. Louis Park on West End development, work at Methodist Hospital and plans for Knollwood Mall's renovation.

Watch the Meeting
The meeting will be live-streamed and available for replay:
Options to Provide Public Comment
Those who wish to provide public comment have three options to participate – written comments, speaking remotely and speaking in-person. Due to COVID-19, the public is encouraged to participate remotely by submitting written comments to City Council via email or participating through Zoom webinar/conferencing service.
Option No. 1: Email Comments to Council
Those who wish to provide written comments directly to the Plymouth City Council may email council@plymouthmn.gov prior to the meeting.
Option No. 2: Comment Remotely via Zoom Webinar/Conferencing Service
Participating remotely limits exposure to COVID-19 and offers the best option to hear the meeting in its entirety without interruption (those speaking in-person must mute their devices while inside the building and will not be able to stay to attend the meeting).
To participate remotely via Zoom webinar/conferencing service, participants must ""register"" for the webinar in advance of the meeting – and speakers will be queued to participate on a first come, first served basis. The deadline to register to participate remotely is noon Tuesday, July 14. Register to speak via Zoom.
Option No. 3: Speak In-Person
Because City Hall has not yet opened to the public and is not able to accommodate an audience due to limited capacity/space to allow for social distancing, those who wish to provide in-person comments will be individually escorted inside to address the council, but will not be able to attend the meeting.
To provide in-person comments during the meeting, participants must ""book an appointment"" via the city's appointment scheduling software. The technology helps limit exposure, reduces lines or gatherings, and facilitates social distancing. Speakers will be added to the queue to participate on a first come, first served basis. In-person speaking appointment scheduling is set to open at noon Tuesday, July 14 at plymouthmn.gov/appointment.
In-person speakers must wait in their vehicles in the parking lot and will receive a notification when it's time for them to come inside. Speakers will be individually escorted inside the main doors at City Hall, will be allotted 3 minutes each to speak and will exit through the Public Safety Building doors. Participants will not be able to stay to attend the meeting, and must follow the directional path for entering and exiting the building.
In-person speakers are encouraged to wear masks inside City Hall. To avoid audio feedback issues, speakers must mute their phones, tablets and mobile devices while they are inside the building.
