J.B. Pritzker's stay-at-home order ""has had a positive effect"" on reducing the number of cases of individuals contracting COVID-19 and deaths in Illinois, the Village Board passed a resolution Monday night calling on the governor to modify certain parts of his Restore Illinois plan. The resolution, which received a 7-2 positive vote, focuses on efforts to assist the business community due to the ""devastating financial impact"" the stay-at-home order has had on Arlington Heights.
""[We passed the resolution] solely for the purpose of encouraging reasonable modifications to the Governor's Restore Illinois Plan for the benefit of our residents and businesses, and particularly our restaurants, by requesting that they be allowed to reopen in Phase 3 instead of Phase 4,"" Arlington Heights Mayor Thomas Hayes told Patch.
In Phase 4 of Pritzker's plan, among other things, restaurants can open with limited capacity and following strict public health procedures, including personal protective equipment for employees. Gatherings with 50 people or fewer will be permitted. In addition, for businesses, Phase 4 includes reopening:

Citing that Pritzker's Restore Illinois plan breaks the state into four geographic regions for reopening, the resolution passed Monday states that in some regions ""there are more dissimilarities between communities than there are similarities as it relates to COVID-19."" The resolution is broken up into four sections:
SECTION ONE: The Village of Arlington Heights commends the Governor for developing a written plan known as Restore Illinois to provide a path forward so that the public has something to respond to.
SECTION TWO: The Village of Arlington Heights immediately requests the Governor to modify the Restore Illinois Plan to base the State on the 11 Emergency Medical Services Regions that have traditionally guided its statewide public health work rather than four newly created Regions.
SECTION THREE: The Village of Arlington Heights urges the Governor to work with the Legislature and Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to develop workable precautions, operational restrictions, and reasonable guidelines and controls for the opening of restaurants, bars and other businesses in Phase 3 of the Restore Illinois Plan.
SECTION FOUR: This Resolution shall be in full force and effect upon passage and approval.
""The vote means that the majority of our Village Board is committed to doing all we can to help our community reopen as soon as possible by finding the right balance between health/safety and economic viability,"" Hayes said.

This article was produced in partnership with The Daily Herald, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.
By David Bernstein for The Daily Herald
In the mid-2000s, Sears, the village of Hoffman Estates and a private developer decided to go into show business together.
They agreed to build the Sears Centre, an 11,000-seat entertainment venue 30 miles northwest of Chicago that was expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people a year from across the region to watch top music acts and sports teams. The village would finance the project with $55 million in bonds. The center would generate the revenue to pay off the notes.
Hoffman Estates Mayor William McLeod reassured taxpayers that the arena would pay for itself — and bring in an additional $1 million a year in tax revenues.
""We're very confident that the arena will be successful,"" he said in 2004.
When the glittering arena opened in October 2006, the debut acts were Duran Duran, Bob Dylan and Lionel Richie. A number of minor-league sports teams have called it home, most recently the Chicago Bulls developmental league team. The arena has built a niche for itself with truck pulls, bull riding, wrestling and mixed martial arts. Local high schools celebrate graduations there and community groups hold book fairs and other events.
Still, the venue has struggled to fulfill its promise. Since opening, it has never posted a profitable year. When the private developers, Minnesota-based Ryan Companies US, threatened to walk away from the money-losing venture, village officials took over the center in 2009.
Today, the Sears Centre is a demonstration of the risk of entangling private corporate interests and public tax dollars.
Hoffman Estates taxpayers are now on the hook to pay off the bond, which will cost $108 million over the full term of the note.
Government subsidies for cultural and entertainment venues are not unusual in the suburbs. But Hoffman Estates' support for the Sears Centre stands out. A private project that was not supposed to cost taxpayers anything instead accounts for 14% of the town's $107 million annual expenses in 2018, the last year for which figures are available. The operating loss — how much the arena's expenses exceeded its revenues — was $1.5 million.
Over the past decade, Hoffman Estates has used nearly $14 million from the general fund and other village accounts to help cover the arena's losses.
McLeod blamed poor management and a recessionary economy for the arena's financial picture — now further clouded by the coronavirus pandemic, which may prevent large crowds from gathering in the near future.
""I think it is working out successfully,"" McLeod said. ""We got a good general manager there. We've got the Windy City Bulls.""
McLeod, who voted for the original deal that brought Sears to Hoffman Estates as a village trustee in 1989, acknowledges that development in the special taxing district as a whole has not lived up to all the promises made three decades ago. But he said Sears Centre brought entertainment and income to the suburb. Village officials said taxes from nearby businesses lured by the presence of the arena cover its annual losses.
""It's a great amenity with the community and the surrounding area,"" McLeod said. ""We have a hospital that doesn't pay taxes, but it's a great amenity for our people. Not everything is for profit.""
The path to the construction of Sears Centre began in 1989, when Sears, then Illinois' largest private employer, threatened to move its headquarters from the famous Sears Tower in downtown Chicago to another state.
To keep Sears from departing, Illinois politicians awarded the company hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tax incentives to build its headquarters and a business park in Hoffman Estates.
The business park, called Prairie Stone, would feature office buildings to hold a plethora of Sears' vendors and suppliers that would, it was assumed, want to be near the retailer, as well as other big companies that would follow Sears to the village.
A second wave of hotels, restaurants, and other stores and service shops, which Sears and village leaders likened to a town center, would turn the former farmland into an economic mecca.
All told, Sears headquarters and Prairie Stone would create 30,000 to 45,000 jobs, including Sears' workforce, or so it was thought. Hoffman Estates would grow larger and wealthier, its population expanding, its housing market heating up and its tax coffers overflowing.
But Prairie Stone showed problems from the start. Months after Sears completed its corporate headquarters, the company built the first pair of office buildings. The company halted work on two other planned buildings in September 1992. The reason? ""Low demand,"" according to a Sears spokesman at the time.
Over the years, Prairie Stone struggled to attract businesses, hampered by false starts and stalled projects. Frustrated by the slow pace of development, Sears churned through three commercial real estate developers hired to market Prairie Stone in less than a year.
""Everyone kept waiting for something to happen in Prairie Stone,"" said Ron Culp, a former vice president of public relations and government affairs at Sears. ""I don't think the buy-in was as big as [Sears] might have anticipated with the big brands putting operations out there.""
Peter Burchard, who was village manager when Sears came to Hoffman Estates, said Sears charged too much for land and rent. And the company overestimated demand for office space.
""We were asking: 'So what's up? Where's the development?'"" Burchard recalled. ""And not much was happening. It was pretty quiet.""
Transformco, a holding company run by Eddie Lampert that now owns Sears, declined comment. Ryan Companies US officials declined to comment.
Prairie Stone's struggles hit Sears and local agencies hard.
Since development was slow, the property value of the district did not produce enough in taxes to pay off the bonds that Hoffman Estates issued to finance the Sears project. Under the terms of the agreement, Sears had to make up any shortfalls. Between 1999 and 2007, Sears paid nearly $83 million to cover deficits.
The jobs never materialized, either. Depending on who was doing the counting, Prairie Stone generated somewhere between 4,300 and 11,000 jobs by 2016 — less than a quarter of what was projected. Nor did tax revenue growth live up to expectations. Projections called for the district to generate an additional $626 million in property tax revenues by 2012, but it only generated about half that amount in inflation-adjusted dollars.
And parts of the area remain vacant. Of the nearly 800 acres in the special taxing district, 184 are undeveloped.
The village was saved from having to use taxpayer funds to cover deficits. But local officials did not receive nearly the revenue they were expecting. Projections called for government agencies to receive a combined $175 million in tax revenues by 2012. Yet, over the first 20 years of the deal, local taxing bodies collected only $50 million, less than a third of what was originally forecast.
Hoffman Estates had long wanted to boost its profile and bring in additional tax revenue.
Neighboring Schaumburg was thriving as the region's premiere commercial and shopping destination. Rosemont, about 20 miles east on I-90, adjacent to O'Hare International Airport, had made big bets on an indoor stadium, a concert hall and a convention center, and it was paying off with new hotels, restaurants and an influx of visitors.
Politicians who helped draft Sears' tax deals said they were designed to retain thousands of corporate jobs. Contractors, landscapers and temporary employees who worked in Sears' buildings were never meant to help the company qualify for tax breaks.
In 1998, the village made efforts to attract the Chicago Bears and, in 2003, it tried to lure the Chicago Fire professional soccer franchise. Both attempts failed.
Then, in 2004, an opportunity arose after voters in nearby Prospect Heights defeated a proposed entertainment arena.
Hoffman Estates saw a chance to replace Poplar Creek — the beloved outdoor music venue that closed in 1994 after Sears demolished it for the development of the Prairie Stone business park.
Sears and village officials decided that a new sports and entertainment arena could anchor an entertainment district within Prairie Stone that would deliver the shot of adrenaline the special tax district needed.
To build it, Hoffman Estates agreed to issue $55 million in bonds. Sears donated 35 acres, took a 25% ownership stake and purchased the naming rights. Ryan Companies, the Minnesota developer that controlled the remaining 75%, would build and run the entertainment center.
Besides civic pride, another underlying rationale of the arena was to increase revenues in the special tax district, which had not delivered the returns that Sears needed to pay off the money it had spent to build its headquarters, village roads and other infrastructure.
James Terrell, a vice president in charge of Sears' real estate holdings at the time, and village officials pushed for the new arena, according to a summary of a deposition in a lawsuit between local school District 300 and Sears over revenue from the deal.
The arena ""would energize"" the Sears' development, according to court documents summarizing Terrell's viewpoint.
Michael Rossiaky, a trustee on the village's park district board and a longtime Hoffman Estates resident, was part of a group of locals that wanted to stop the arena development in 2005.
Rossiaky warned village leaders that an arena was a bad idea because unlike the Prairie Stone development, where Sears agreed to pay off any shortfalls in revenue flow, the village would be responsible for repaying the bonds if the Sears Centre failed.
""They were closed off to what anyone said,"" Rossiaky said. ""They didn't care. They just wanted to bulldoze it through.""
McLeod and other proponents of the project argued that the Sears Centre would be the linchpin to creating an entertainment district called ""Poplar Creek at 59-90,"" after the old concert venue located by Route 59 and the I-90 tollway. It would be a tourist destination that would include restaurants and a hotel and waterpark.
The new arena ""will put Hoffman Estates back on the map,"" McLeod said in 2005. ""This would be another feather in our cap.""
After just four years of poor attendance and losses, the developers — blaming a bad economy — threatened to let the arena go into default. Instead, the village took it over in December 2009.
""Our biggest worry was that they would go belly up and they would stick Hoffman Estates with the bill,"" Rossiaky said. ""And that's what's happened.""
Over the past decade, the village has moved nearly $14 million from its general fund and other accounts to make up for the arena's losses, with amounts varying from a low of $150,000 in 2016 to a high of $3 million in 2009.
Last year, the Sears Centre hosted 89 events — far from initial estimates that projected 140 shows and games a year.
Village taxpayers now pay to keep the arena in business. Between 2014 and 2018, the most recent year available, the arena brought in an average of $10.7 million annually in operating revenue, while costing $12.4 million per year to run, according to village figures. Each year, the village must use general funds to cover an average deficit of nearly $2 million.
In addition, the village must pay for upkeep and improvements at the arena — costs that, before the outbreak of the coronavirus, were projected to reach $2 million over the next seven years.
Since the village owns the venue, it no longer collects the more than $1 million a year in property taxes that the stadium used to generate.
McLeod blamed the center's shortcomings on an inexperienced developer, poor marketing and a bad economy.
""I think part of the plan when it was put in was, 'We're going to have many more venues around it, restaurants and all that stuff.' And then the recession hit,"" McLeod said.
McLeod has not given up on Prairie Stone. In recent years, a Main Event family entertainment center and a Duluth Trading Company retail store have opened, but only after the village added additional tax breaks to lure the businesses to the site: $750,000 in entertainment tax rebates for Main Event and $225,000 in sales tax rebates for Duluth Trading.
Cabela's opened a hunting and fishing superstore in Prairie Stone in 2007. To snag the outlet, Hoffman Estates agreed to provide $18 million in tax rebates to the $2 billion-a-year company.
It also agreed to exempt from property taxes the store's elaborate taxidermy dioramas and aquarium displays. Those include ""Conservation Mountain,"" a two-story fiberglass mountain with artificial trees, a waterfall and stuffed animals such as deer, bears and waterfowl that occupies about 15% of the store's 185,000 square feet.
Cabela's estimated that the tax exemption would allow it to save $5.5 million in property taxes over 20 years, about $275,000 a year.
The logic? Under the agreement, the displays belong to the village. And they have a special designation. Cabela's displays are now Hoffman Estates' only publicly owned museum.
McLeod said the Cabela's deal was worth it.
""I'm not particularly a big fan of this sort of stuff,"" McLeod said. ""But it's the cost of doing business these days.""

This article was produced in partnership with the Daily Herald, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.
On a hot Sunday afternoon in June 1989, two of the most powerful men in Illinois met to watch a ballgame at Wrigley Field — and, if all went well, to make a deal.
James R. Thompson, the state's four-term Republican governor, and Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Co., the world's largest retailer, had been deep in talks for months.
The stakes were high. Brennan was threatening to move Sears' corporate headquarters, located in downtown Chicago in what was then the tallest skyscraper in the world, to another state. The move would rob Illinois of thousands of good-paying jobs, tens of millions in tax revenues and its reputation as a business-friendly state.
As the two men watched the Montreal Expos blank the Cubs 5-0, dropping the ""Lovable Losers"" out of first place, Thompson told Brennan he'd do whatever it took to keep Sears from leaving. The state had crafted a package of financial incentives that the legendary political deal maker believed was too good to pass up.
After the game ended, Thompson called up one of his closest associates, Jay Hedges, director of the state's Department of Commerce and Community Affairs. In a recent interview, Hedges recalled Thompson delivering the news of his breakthrough.
""Well, Jay, Sears is staying in Illinois,"" Thompson told him. ""And they want to move to Hoffman Estates.""
The deal cemented that day would permanently change Illinois, as politicians embraced the use of taxpayer funds to stop a growing exodus of jobs from the state. Since 1989, state and local officials have given $5.3 billion in government incentives to corporations, according to Good Jobs First, a non profit which compiles data on tax deals.
In Sears' case, state and local officials awarded the company subsidies and tax deals worth more than $536 million over the past three decades — the largest package of governmental incentives ever given to a single company in Illinois.
The tax breaks and credits would transform Hoffman Estates, then a suburb of 45,000 that lay among cornfields 30 miles northwest of Chicago. Sears worked with state and local politicians to build a sprawling corporate headquarters, new roads, tollway interchanges and other infrastructure in the growing village.
Today, Sears, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, is struggling to stay in business, battered by relentless competition and its own miscues and missteps. Billionaire hedge fund manager and former Sears chief executive Eddie Lampert purchased the assets of the company to revive it and avoid liquidation. Creditors continue to scrap over the corporate remains in a bankruptcy courtroom in New York City. Sears closed retail stores across the country in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, further jeopardizing the company's financial condition.
The corporate campus built in Hoffman Estates is largely vacant, a hollowed-out shell with a skeletal workforce surrounded by acres of unused parking.
Hoffman Estates Mayor William McLeod was a village trustee who voted for the original deal that brought Sears to Hoffman Estates in 1989. As the mayor in 2011, he lobbied for the state to extend tax benefits as Sears once again threatened to leave the state.
Today, he says the benefits of the Sears deal to the village and the state are obvious. Simply look around, he says. ""We built another city out here.""
ProPublica and the Daily Herald wanted to know whether the investment paid off. Where has the deal succeeded? Where has it failed? What did Illinois and Hoffman Estates taxpayers get for the half billion dollars awarded to Sears?
The review of the Sears deal shows that 30 years of spending public money on private interests failed to deliver the economic bonanza envisioned by corporate, state and local officials.
When the deal was getting off the ground in 1989, an economic impact study forecast that a special tax district created for Sears would generate the equivalent of $626 million in total property tax revenues by 2012. Total revenues wound up actually being closer to $338 million, when adjusted to 1989 dollars — 54% of what was projected.
The shortage prompted state and local officials to invest additional money into more development projects. For instance, Hoffman Estates worked with Sears and private developers to issue $55 million in bonds to construct Sears Centre, an 11,000-seat entertainment arena. One reason was to make up for the poor performance of the tax district by bringing in more revenue, according to a summary of a deposition from one of the arena's developers in court files. Instead, the arena was a financial drain, its costs increasingly borne by Hoffman Estates taxpayers.
In 2012, Illinois and Hoffman Estates officials negotiated a new deal which extended the life of the taxing district by 15 years. The deal was marked by loopholes that allowed Sears to continue collecting tax revenues even as job losses mounted, according to the Daily Herald and ProPublica review.
As part of the agreement, legislators required Sears to keep a certain number of jobs in Hoffman Estates to receive tax benefits. But as the company laid off thousands of workers in the years after the deal was inked, it began to count not only Sears jobs but any employment associated with the company's headquarters — such as workers at the fast food restaurants in the building's front atrium. Legislators said they never intended to allow Sears to include other firms' employees in its tallies, but state officials did little to monitor the company's compliance.
In coming days, the Daily Herald and ProPublica will examine the results of more than a half-billion dollars in tax breaks awarded over 30 years by Illinois and Hoffman Estates taxpayers to attract and retain the headquarters of Sears. Our first story is an overall look at the failure of Sears to deliver on promises of increased tax revenue and corporate jobs. Other stories will examine:

The news organizations also commissioned an analysis to examine whether the incentives had any lasting economic effect — the underlying justification for giving Sears the tax breaks in the first place. The study, conducted for the news organizations by the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, or CTBA, a bipartisan research and advocacy organization focused on social and economic justice, found no evidence that Hoffman Estates wound up better off in terms of property values and employment than similar towns around Chicago that spent little or no money on tax deals for corporations.
Hoffman Estates would likely have experienced significant growth without Sears, the study suggested. Suburbs similar to Hoffman Estates saw gains in jobs and property values without giving hundreds of millions in incentives to a single company.
CTBA used a statistical method known as a ""difference-in-differences,"" which measured the economic impact of the Sears deal by comparing before-and-after economic trends in Hoffman Estates to similar, nearby communities over the same time period between 1980 to 2017.
CTBA relied on nine economic variables, ranging from annual employment figures and median income to the taxable property values in each municipality.
The Sears deal ""absolutely wasn't worth the money,"" said Ralph Martire, the CTBA's executive director. ""None of the anticipated benefits came anywhere near materializing.""
State and local officials maintain none of the development that happened in or around Hoffman Estates would have occurred if not for the incentives granted to Sears.
Sears money helped to pay for new roads, highway exits, police and fire protection — all without the financial strain created by residential growth, they say.
The Sears Centre, McLeod said, was ""working out successfully,"" attracting nearby retail stores and restaurants.
McLeod acknowledged that the deal may not have lived up to expectations. But he said that it generated, essentially, free money that put no extra burden on schools, libraries or parks. It attracted new businesses and brought tens of millions of additional tax dollars to the village.
""I can't figure out the downside,"" McLeod said.
Officials with the state Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, which awarded $230 million in tax credits and other incentives to Sears over 30 years, declined to comment. They noted that the tax arrangements had been made long before current Gov. J.B. Pritzker took office.
Thompson declined to comment. Brennan died in 2007.
A spokesman for Transformco, the current owner of Sears, declined to comment. Transformco is the company that Lampert and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, created to buy Sears out of bankruptcy in February 2019.
""We're a private company and don't comment on these sorts of details,"" a spokesman said.
Thompson and fellow politicians' willingness to provide substantial tax incentives and property improvements to keep Sears in Illinois set off a rush among big corporations to seek similar payouts from municipalities and states across the country. It wasn't the first such deal in the United States. But it was one of the biggest at the time.
Companies quickly learned to pit city against city to spark frenzied bidding wars. Every year across the United States, state and local governments now hand out an estimated $45 billion in tax breaks and other subsidies to attract business, according to Timothy Bartik, a leading scholar of tax incentives at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
In a highly publicized battle two years ago, Amazon, one of the world's richest companies, extracted promises of more than $2 billion in incentives from New York and Virginia to build a new corporate headquarters in a contest among hundreds of communities. The New York deal collapsed after fierce opposition from local critics.
Louisiana attracts chemical companies with one of the country's most generous tax exemptions. The idea is to bring jobs to the state. Instead, construction often happens offsite, and automation has cut down on the jobs that remain.
The ProPublica review provides additional evidence to a growing consensus among economists: Tax breaks generally don't provide the expected benefits to local economies.
Contrary to the assumption that tax incentives are needed to keep corporations from relocating, government aid frequently does little more than reward businesses for moving where they already planned to move or for creating jobs they already planned to create, said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies economic development. Incentives spending, he noted, is inherently a zero-sum game: Every dollar awarded to Sears is one less dollar for public schools, roads and parks, or police and fire protection.
""That's one of the underreported things,"" Jensen said. ""We can think about these deals as costs on society.""
Those costs have real-world effects.
Nancy Zettler lives in Algonquin-based Community Unit School District 300, which overlaps a portion of the Sears tax district, though there are no District 300 students living within the tax district's boundaries.
District 300 is the state's sixth largest and serves 21,000 students, at 26 schools, covering 118 square miles, from wealthy Barrington Hills to working-class Carpentersville. Four out of every 10 students are low-income or qualify for free or reduced lunches.
When her kids started going to school in the district, she couldn't understand why it was struggling financially.
Zettler's oldest daughter's first-grade classroom at Westfield Community School had 35 kids in it. In some cases, children attended classes in portable trailers, and special education classes met in storage closets because of overcrowding. Some buildings were also in serious disrepair. ""It was horrible,"" she said.
When she learned that millions of dollars each year were flowing to Sears through the special tax district — known as an economic development area, or EDA — instead of going to the schools, she was angered. ""I started researching it, and I was like, 'Whaaaat?'""
In October 2011, students, teachers and parents march in protest over the possible extension of the Sears Economic Development Area. Despite their opposition, the EDA was extended in 2012.
(Rick West/The Daily Herald)
District 300, like every other Illinois school district, is dependent on local property taxes for revenue. But the school system's advocates, who long have challenged the extension of the Sears incentives, argue that with the majority of money from the special district going to Sears, the district received far less taxes over time.
Over the two-decade duration of the first Sears tax break, District 300 collected $26.5 million. The terms of the deal, they say, meant that the district may have missed out on as much as $270 million in property taxes that instead financed the Sears development.
Today, District 300 is suing Sears and Hoffman Estates to try to claw back some of the funds. District attorneys argue that Sears failed to maintain enough jobs under the terms of the 2012 agreement. They say that Hoffman Estates failed to police the company. The lawsuit seeks the return of $43 million in taxes.
Attorneys for Sears said they met all the conditions of the deal.
McLeod said it was the state's job to hold Sears accountable. He noted that District 300 had received tens of millions of dollars from the Sears deal, even though Hoffman Estates children don't attend its schools.
""I have no mechanism to measure how many people are in those buildings,"" McLeod said. ""We just follow the law that the legislature passed.""
But Zettler, who now serves on the District 300 school board, said the tax money should have gone to education.
""These deals that the state and local governments make with these businesses are flat-out bad,"" Zettler said.
In the years after Phoenix homebuilders Sam Hoffman and his son, Jack, bought a 160-acre farm 30 miles northwest of Chicago in 1954 and split up the land into a neat subdivision of half-acre lots, the village that would come to bear the family's surname grew at a steady clip.
Sprawl came remarkably fast to Hoffman Estates, as returning veterans and city ex-pats scooped up the modestly priced homes in the tract developments that were taking over the suburban landscape. In 1960, a year after the village was incorporated, more than 8,000 people called Hoffman Estates home.
Village leaders were quick to catch onto Chicago-style, pay-to-play politics. In 1973, two former mayors, Roy L. Jenkins and Edward F. Pinger, along with four trustees on the village board went to prison for accepting bribes in exchange for favorable
zoning.
Emerging from those scandals in the mid-1970s, Hoffman Estates was a town with an identity crisis. Spanning five townships and crossing two counties, the village had no traditional ""Main Street"" downtown, and its students were spread across six school districts. It was less of a cohesive village than an amalgamation of subdivisions dotted with shopping plazas.
While the village had become a flourishing, if sleepy, bedroom community, its fast growth came with a price: More people meant higher costs for more municipal services like schools, parks and police.
The village lacked much of a commercial tax base to help pay the bills. Officials wanted to attract more business not only to keep residential tax rates down but to bring more jobs for locals.
They looked with envy at Schaumburg, their rapidly expanding neighbor to the east, as it cemented itself as the economic powerhouse of the northwest suburbs. It had the Woodfield Shopping Center, the area's destination shopping mall, along with retail stores and restaurants. It filled up with office buildings, including the headquarters of Motorola, which arrived in 1976.
Schaumburg was so flush with commercial tax cash that its residents didn't even pay local property taxes until 2009.
Hoffman Estates had one thing Schaumburg didn't: thousands of undeveloped acres of land. One site contained nearly 800 acres of rolling farmland between Beverly Road and Route 59, just off the Northwest Tollway.
It was just what Sears wanted.
Brennan was looking in 1989 to leave Sears Tower, which dominated Chicago's skyline as a none-too-subtle reminder of the company's reach and riches. He was looking for a less expensive headquarters in a sprawling suburban campus. The land had to be cheap and shovel-ready. The location needed to be next to an interstate, with an easily accessible interchange, and close to an airport.
Thompson's administration identified Hoffman Estates as a probable site.
The details of the deal, worth $261 million in 1989, are complex.
In exchange for agreeing to move its headquarters to Hoffman Estates, the company received a state promise to spend more than $61 million — a sum that later grew to $80 million — for infrastructure improvements. The state built two new tollway interchanges to connect the Sears headquarters to the Interstate 90 and handle the thousands of vehicles that would be going in and out of the complex each day.
The company was also given the 800 acres along the tollway paid for by $181 million in bonds issued by Hoffman Estates and funded by increased property tax revenues in the district.
The company used 200 acres for its new campus-like headquarters — more than 2 million square feet of office space in low-slung buildings with blue-mirrored glass, designed to hold 5,000 to 6,000 employees.
More than half the size of the Pentagon, the complex was a self-contained world. There was a main concourse with a coffee shop, hair salon, drug store, travel agency and sundry shop.
There was a 1,000-seat auditorium, a fitness center, and a huge cafeteria and fast-food dining that rivaled the big food courts found in shopping malls.
Surrounding the headquarters was a tranquil, natural setting of reconstructed prairie, indigenous plants, wildflowers, wetlands and lake-like retention ponds.
""It was a beautiful facility,"" recalled Ron Culp, Sears' former vice president of public relations. ""But you felt like you were being held captive in a kind of remote location.""

Under the deal, Sears planned to develop the remainder — nearly 600 acres — for itself. Plans called for a business park, with additional office buildings, hotels, restaurants and shops, which officials likened to a town center.
To pay for the new development, state and local officials established two special tax districts drawn around the company's new corporate headquarters.
One district designated the land around Sears as a state enterprise zone, which provided millions of dollars in tax breaks on sales, construction materials and the cost of utilities.
The second was called an Economic Development Area, or EDA. Property taxes within the district were frozen from 1989 through 2012, when the agreement expired. Additional tax revenue — raised by the growth of property values in the area during that 23-year period — was funneled into projects designed to mutually benefit Sears and Hoffman Estates.
For instance, Sears paid to offset additional village expenses associated with Sears' move, including hiring more police officers and firefighters and building a new water tower. The revenue raised in the special tax district was used to reimburse the company.
Similar districts, often called tax increment financing districts, or TIFs, are frequently used to improve blighted urban areas. But Hoffman Estates was a comfortable, middle-class suburb. So Thompson spearheaded a special law that allowed the financing mechanism to be used for Sears.
The majority of the revenue raised went to Sears. The rest was distributed to more than a dozen other local taxing bodies within the economic development area. Hoffman Estates alone was guaranteed $57 million through 2012.
When the EDA district expired in 2012, the thinking was, Sears would have recouped all of its costs. The local government agencies — after functioning for more than two decades without increased property tax revenue — would suddenly see a flood of new money with the lifting of the tax caps.
But by the time 2012 rolled around, Sears was in serious trouble. Over the decades, the company had lost ground to other retail competitors such as Amazon and Home Depot. The company had fired tens of thousands of employees and shuttered retail stores across America.
With Lampert as its majority shareholder, Sears approached the state with a new, if familiar, threat: Without an extension of the deal, the company would leave. Despite the company's dismal outlook, state and local officials agreed to Sears' demands.
They approved a 15-year extension of the EDA worth an estimated $125 million. The state's economic development agency also kicked in another $150 million in payroll tax credits through the state's flagship jobs initiative, Economic Development for a Growing Economy, or EDGE.
The new deal required Sears to retain 4,250 employees.
Experts acknowledge that it may appear ill-conceived for Illinois and local governments to award hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and incentives to a financially troubled company.
But back in the early days, it was all too easy to ignore the warning signs.
Three days after Thompson and Brennan announced the original deal, Sears laid off 400 managerial employees. By the time Sears opened its new headquarters at Hoffman Estates in the summer of 1992, the company had shed a reported 1,600 office jobs at the headquarters and had eliminated more than 43,000 jobs across its empire.
The losses did nothing to dim the enthusiasm. Illinois was keeping Sears. Hoffman Estates was vaulting onto the map.
All of it seemed to come at no cost — free roads and free services.
Peter Burchard was the 34-year-old village manager of Hoffman Estates when the deal was signed. He counted himself as one of the true believers in its promise to turn the city, the entire region, into an economic powerhouse.
Today, Burchard says Sears squandered a half-billion dollar opportunity. The company, he said, charged too much for leases and office space, impeding development.
""They put a premium on everything, because it was Sears,"" Burchard said. ""It was kind of arrogance.""
But in the beginning?
""The potential was just enormous,"" said Burchard, now 64. ""Dreams! Potential! Possibilities!""

5,/illinois/arlingtonheights/mayor-estimates-8-9m-loss-revenue,2020-05-06T18:31:19Z,Canceled Events Hinder Arlington Heights Finances,0,5,Eric DeGrechie,Patch Staff,"ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL — On the first Saturday of every May, sports fans get excited to watch the annual Run for the Roses, better known as the Kentucky Derby. Arlington International Racecourse typically syncs up its first weekend of spring/summer live racing with it and Arlington Heights embraces the influx of horse racing fans coming into the village. Due to COVID-19, these are anything but typical times.
As a result of the coronavirus, the Kentucky Derby was postponed until September and Arlington didn't open on May 1. This news comes on the heels of the announcement Frontier Days has been postponed. Though Arlington Heights is not unique in its necessity to face the various obstacles coronavirus presents on a daily basis, the municipality does have specific challenges of its own.
""I've been meeting with other mayors, not just in the area, but in the whole state. I'm aware of what's going on in other municipalities,"" Arlington Heights Mayor Thomas Hayes told Patch. ""We're all pretty much in the same boat, depending on the size of your community.""
Hayes estimates that Arlington Heights, one of the 15 largest municipalities in the state, will lose between $8-9 million in revenue due to COVID-19, based on the latest projections. The revenue is usually generated from sales, tax revenues and other fees.
""Everyone is feeling the economic impact. We were fortunate enough to be in a strong financial position going into this,"" Hayes said. ""It's not to say we won't have to look at cutting costs in the year ahead and we've already started to do that. [Cuts will] not necessarily be in terms of layoffs, but cutting out any extraneous expenses.""
As local government is considered an essential business, critical infrastructure services on the village level like road repair, sidewalk replacement, water and sewer work, are not affected by the stay-at-home order, which is in effect through May 30. Hayes stressed that all public employees are following social distancing guidelines when at work.
""It's an inconvenience for them, but it's work that has to get done,"" Hayes said.
While essential projects have not been affected or delayed, the events calendar in Arlington Heights has been decimated. As of press time, here are a few that have been affected:
""A lot of the fun family activities have taken the brunt of the cancellations,"" Hayes said.
Though Hayes hasn't heard of any businesses closing around town, he does know many, especially restaurants, are seeing a significant decrease in revenue.
""Restaurants are such a big part of downtown Arlington Heights. We've heard stories of some losing 90 percent of their revenue even though they're doing take-out and delivery,"" Hayes said. ""They're doing all they can and I know the federal and state governments are doing all they can to help them out.""
The Village is looking to help as well by inquiring about a financial assistance packages for loan programs, deferral of costs and fees for liquor licenses, among other things.
Meanwhile, an opening date for Arlington International Racecourse has not been determined. Hayes admits not having live horse racing in Arlington Heights this summer will hurt revenue across the board, including tourism, but also understands the inherent dangers such a public gathering could wreak.
""It's such a big part of our community. There are a lot of complex issues involved in terms of health with a lot of people in close proximity. It's not just the spectators, but the horsemen, trainers and all of the people in the backstretch,"" Hayes said. ""We are certainly supportive of the racetrack and want to see them open as soon as possible."""

April 28, 2020
Dear Governor Pritzker,
During this unprecedented challenge to our state, you stressed multiple times your willingness and eagerness to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle and from every part of the state. As the women of the House Republican Caucus, we stand ready to offer solutions and work with you to implement a safe and reasonable regional plan to open Illinois. We are business owners, scientists, mayors, lawyers, community organizers, volunteers, officers, mothers, sisters, grandmothers, caregivers, and legislators. We represent 880,000 Illinoisans across all regions of the state—from the Chicago suburbs to regions in northern, western, eastern, southern, and central Illinois.
Our family members and constituents are fighting on the front lines as healthcare workers. We know and love people who are diagnosed with and suffering from COVID-19. We know, love, and represent people who lost their jobs, closed their small businesses, and exhausted their savings. For us, this is not political. This is personal.
We asked many questions concerning IDPH modeling, PPE procurement process and inventory, IDOC policies for transfers and releases, issues at IDES, safeguarding Long Term Care Facilities, and protecting state facilities for veterans and the developmentally disabled. We made many suggestions to promote physical and mental wellbeing, including opening state parks, locking down our prisons, housing our homeless, and protecting our most vulnerable populations. You did respond to our request for IDNR to open our state parks, thank you.
Unfortunately, a majority of our questions and suggestions are not acknowledged. We reached out to you, but you have not contacted one Republican woman legislator to discuss our concerns, suggestions, or solutions. We are writing to tell you as a matter of record the House Republican Women are here for Illinois. We are ready to offer suggestions, strategies, and solutions; and we are calling for the legislature to reconvene. We want to do our job as essential employees for our state and want to work with you to safely and regionally reopen our state.
SAFELY
● As elected officials, we have a responsibility to all Illinois citizens. Our number one priority as wereopen Illinois is to protect those who are vulnerable to this virus and ensure they have the appropriate support and necessary resources.
REASONABLY
● Illinois needs a reasoned and common-sense plan to reopen our state region by region understanding the virus affects each region differently. Some of these common sense steps include:
RESPONSIBLY
● Our constituents deserve a responsible government—a government where there are effective checks and balances and a government where all voices are heard. A responsible government means calling the legislature back to session.
REGIONALLY
● One size does not fit all. We must safely open our state on a regional basis. Other states including New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa proposed measured, regional reopening strategies.
We, the women of the House Republican Caucus, ask you to work with us. We are prepared to work on a serious plan to reopen Illinois safely, reasonably, responsibly, and regionally. We request you meet with us collectively as a group to share our ideas and offer solutions. We must continue to protect our vulnerable populations and safeguard our healthcare delivery systems, while we must also save our economy and our families. We are prepared to assist in developing and implementing a plan to safely get Illinois back to business reasonably, regionally, and responsibly.
Finally, as members of a co-equal branch of government, we request you call a special legislative session to start work on reopening Illinois safely and regionally.
We are ready and await a meeting with you.
Sincerely,
Rep. Avery Bourne
Rep. Terri Bryant
Rep. Amy L. Grant

March 17 2020
Dear City of Good Neighbors,
I thought I had seen just about everything in my nearly 30 years on the Village Board. Then came the Coronavirus. It goes without saying that we are living in a time of daily uncertainty that most of us have never experienced. It also goes without saying that our top priority right now is the health, safety and welfare of all in our community.
I want to assure you that the Village of Arlington Heights is taking the COVID-19 situation very seriously and is in constant communication with our federal, state and county health officials to stay abreast of the latest information, restrictions and recommendations. That information is then being disseminated to the public through our Coronavirus Update Page on our website and also through our social media platforms on Facebook, Twitter and NextDoor.
The message I want to convey to you today is that we are all in this together and that we will get through this together. Your government really is here to help. This global health pandemic requires everyone to do their part to reduce community exposure to the virus by practicing social distancing, washing hands frequently, covering your coughs and sneezes, working from home if possible, and staying home/self-quarantine if you are sick. We must also be diligent in following the state mandates of temporary restaurant and bar closures, school closings, eliminating gatherings of 50 or more people and no more than 10, if at all possible, and conforming to other voluntary shut-downs in an effort to limit our exposure to this virus and contribute to the national effort to flatten the curve.
The federal, state and county health agencies are setting the protocols and mandates for mitigating the spread of this virus. It's up to our entire community to do our part by following the mandates and doing what we can to keep our loved ones, co-workers and neighbors safe.
We understand that many of you may be feeling isolated as public health officials encourage us to distance ourselves from others and to not gather in large groups. We must follow their guidelines and alter our normal behavior for sure. At the same time, I encourage you to go on living your daily lives as much as possible. In particular, this is a time to find ways to connect in different ways with your loved ones and friends, spend time doing family activities with your children such as game and movie nights, and please be a good neighbor and check on those who are elderly or may have compromised health and are therefore in the higher-risk group for contracting the virus. Our emotional wellness in a time like this is just as important as our physical well-being.
Our businesses add vibrancy to our lives and to the appeal of Arlington Heights as a dining and entertainment destination. More than ever before, our local restaurants and businesses need your loyal community support! Please continue to support local restaurants and their staff by ordering from one of the many restaurants offering pick-up or delivery services during the mandated closure period. Please check our updated list of restaurants offering these convenient services.
Finally, please keep our first responders and health care providers in your thoughts and prayers as they fulfill their duties during this time without hesitation. Your support for them and your patience and cooperation during this stressful time is greatly appreciated. Thank you for continuing to build upon our strong community spirit as the largest small town in America. Together, we will get through this unprecedented time.
I encourage you to stay updated on the ever-changing news pertaining to COVID-19 by visiting our news update. Stay healthy and please do not hesitate to reach out to the Village if you have any questions by calling 847.368.5000.
Sincerely,


Mayor Thomas W. Hayes

Sees Shortage In Election Judges,0,0,Amie Schaenzer,Patch Staff,"COOK COUNTY, IL — The Cook County Clerk's Office is looking for election judges to work on Election Day this Tuesday, according to a news release from the clerk's office. The need for election judges for the upcoming primary is mainly for north and northwest Cook County, including Orland, Lyons, Leyden, Maine, Elk Grove, Wheeling, Schaumburg and Northfield townships.
The clerk's office is concerned over no-shows on Election Day, which is common, and also has had some pollworkers decline to work on Tuesday due to concerns over COVID-19. Every one of suburban Cook County's 1,599 precincts have multiple Election Judges already assigned – the clerk's office is looking to beef up the ranks to ensure each precinct has a full team.
""With approximately 8,000 pollworkers to staff some 1,600 precincts, there will always be Election Day no-shows,"" Yarbrough said. ""We can't predict how many will not show up, but we're working to guard against this unpredictability by making sure each precinct has a full team of Election Judges.""
Pollworkers can come from any part of suburban Cook County but those who apply this week should know that on Election Day they would be working in one of these areas, according to a news release. Election Judges work together to ensure their polling place is running smoothly and voters are properly served and are paid $200.
The clerk's office is seeking additional election judge and has no need for polling place technicians, according to the news release. Interested registered voters must apply online and attend a mandatory training class to be an Election Judge.
The application process will be open through Friday, March 13. The Clerk's Office will have two training sessions on Friday – at 1 and 6 p.m.– at the Election Operations Center in Cicero. Seats are limited, so those interested are encouraged to apply online as soon as possible.

Ryan, who served as mayor between 1975 and 1989 and then went on to serve as a Cook County Judge from 1996 to 2004, helped bring Lake Michigan water to town, secured a tax break to help Arlington International Racecourse reopen after a fire in 1985, and worked to rally other village officials and trustees to get behind his ideas on redeveloping the central business district and downtown.
""A lot of our skyline in downtown Arlington Heights is owed to his thoughtfulness and planning and foresight he had,"" Ernie Blomquist, a longtime village prosecutor for Arlington Heights who started with the village when Ryan was mayor, told the Daily Herald. ""He saw all the towns along the Northwestern railroad starting to crumble and fall apart, and he didn't want that for Arlington.""
""He pushed and pulled and thought it out and put together a nice plan. It's why Arlington is the jewel it is among Northwest suburban communities.""
He is also credited with helping with the expansion of the Lutheran Village, development of Lake Arlington and Nike site and expansion of Arlington Heights library, historical society, and a village youth center, according to his obituary.
His service was commemorated with the dedication of 'Ryan Plaza' downtown in the village of Arlington Heights. A celebration of life is expected to happen next spring.

The BIG Program has allocated $220 million in the second round for movie theatres, performing arts venues, concert venues and more to help them stay afloat through these uncertain times and make sure they have the means to open safely in the coming months.
BIG funds can be used to help businesses cover the costs of payroll, rent, utilities and other working capital during the time they have experienced interruptions due to the pandemic.
To ensure funds are distributed across the state and across business type, $60 million has been specifically allocated for heavily distressed industries, including indoor recreation facilities and amusement parks, and another $70 million has been set aside for businesses located in disproportionately impacted areas, or low-income areas that have experienced high rates of COVID-19. Wheeling businesses may qualify for part of the $70 million.

It takes a very special citizen and act to receive such an honor. Kyla Davis, of Skokie, is one such person as evidenced by her recent act of heroism.
During the morning of Aug. 27, Davis was driving through a parking lot near the intersection of Goebbert and Algonquin roads when a woman was attempting to get into her car and was confronted by a man, who was brandishing a knife. According to the proclamation read by Hayes at the Sept. 8 board meeting, Davis heard the woman scream and called 911. She saw the man put the knife to the woman's neck and force her into his SUV.
The woman was able to escape from the SUV and began running toward Davis with the man giving chase. Davis let the woman into her car and locked the door. At this time, the man attempted to open the door before Davis was able to drive away and create distance and safety for the woman.
""Kyla continued to talk to the 911 operator while driving west on Algonquin Road. She noticed the offender was following from a distance,"" Hayes said. ""Kyla then navigated the intersection of Algonquin and Arlington Heights roads. She followed the dispatcher's instructions to drive toward the Arlington Heights Police Station with her hazard lights activated.""
The man then struck two other vehicles and discontinued his pursuit of Davis and the woman. Police intercepted Davis a short time later and the woman told the officer that she was in fear for her life. The man had told the woman he was going to kill her and then himself. According to Hayes, the man did end up committing suicide shortly after the two hit-and-run collisions.
""Police concluded that the victim would not have survived the encounter that morning if it were not for the swift and decisive actions of Ms. Kyla Davis,"" Hayes said. ""Kyla's willingness to get involved by coming to the immediate aid of a fellow citizen in crisis exemplifies the definition of Good Samaritan.""
The Arlington Heights Police Department Chief's Meritorious Service Award was presented to Davis by Police Chief Nick Pecora. Davis, who was in attendance with her parents and boyfriend, also received a newly minted village coin, the first one awarded by the Village.
""This is not just a good story, but a great story. Who knows what any of us would have done in your situation, but you acted and you saved somebody's life, and we can't thank you enough for your heroic efforts on that day,"" Hayes said."

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Cook County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in the 2016 election, working with ProPublica to bring you information on broken scanners and long lines at the polls in Brooklyn, the extension of voting hours in Durham County, North Carolina, due to technical issues, voting improprieties in Texas, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and much more.
There will be eight polling places open in Arlington Heights on Election Night, Nov. 3:
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:"

State Senator Ann Gillespie (D-Arlington Heights) is asking residents to participate in the 2020 Census and cautioning them about the consequences of failing to fill it out before the deadline that is now just three weeks away.
Cook County is reporting a lower response rate compared to its previous rate in 2010, which could and most likely will affect everything from how congressional districts are drawn to how highway funds are allocated.
""This is serious. If we don't come together as a community, we'll all lose federal representation which directly effects the opportunities our communities are afforded,"" Gillespie said. ""This year the census has a new online option, it's easier than before to fill out. When I filled out mine, it took me less than 10 minutes to complete.""
The census is now safer, more secure, and just as confidential. Filling out the form is crucial as 2020 brings new congressional district maps, helps determine how federal funds flow into states and provides information that will affect communities across Illinois for the next 10 years.
Currently, 82.8% of Arlington Heights residents, 78.7% of Palatine residents and 79.6% of Mount Prospect residents have filled out the form this year. Although many of the communities in the 27th Illinois Senate District have a higher response rate than 2010, it's still important to fill out your census if you haven't done so, Gillespie said.
""Until there's a 100% response rate, schools, roads, hospitals and other critical community services are not getting every cent of the federal taxes they've paid,"" Gillespie said. ""This determines so much about what federal money comes to Illinois, so let's make sure we all count.""

""Blood donations have been critically low during a time when they are needed more than ever,"" Morrison (D-Lake Forest) said. ""If you are able, I encourage you to donate – it could save a life.""
The blood drive, in partnership with Versiti, will be held Sept. 15 from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. at Prospect Heights fire protection building, located at 10 E. Camp McDonald Road. All successful blood donations will be tested for COVID-19 antibodies.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 17.2 million units of blood are used in transfusions every year for accident victims, cancer patients, hemophiliacs, surgery patients and more.

Standing with essential workers, State Senator Ann Gillespie (D-Arlington Heights) commended a labor package signed into law on Friday that will increase first responder benefits, protect retail employees and expand collective bargaining rights.
""Essential employees and first responders have been on the front lines fighting for us, and we need to look out for them,"" Gillespie said. ""A workplace free from harassment, with livable wages and time to recuperate from injury are all rights that every employee should have.""
This historic labor package expands paid disability leave for first responders by 60 days due to decreased access to rehabilitative services. It also elevates the charge of battery of a retail employee to aggravated battery if the incident took place during or up to six months after a declared public health emergency. Aggravated battery charges would also apply to incidents that occur while an employee relays directions for health and safety precautions, among other duties.
Senate Bill 471 also requires existing racetracks with 10 or more employees to engage in collective bargaining if the track wishes to expand to include a casino. While the horse racing industry is excluded from federal collective bargaining laws, Illinois has extended similar protections to most businesses. The new law is effective immediately.

""CTE programs aren't just for those entering the trades but can prepare students for careers in a variety of fields,"" Gillespie said. ""There is no better investment than developing the professional skills of our future generation of educators.""
The Illinois State Board of Education awarded the Northwest Education Council for Student Success a grant of $249,000, which will be distributed to nine high schools in the Northwest Suburbs to develop CTE programs focused on careers in education. Two of the nine schools are in the 27th District — Palatine High School and Rolling Meadows High School.
""The CTE programs at High School District 211 and 214 represent the best our state has to offer in preparing young adults for long-term career paths,"" Gillespie said. ""Congratulations to Palatine and Rolling Meadows High Schools and the other recipients. I am eager to see the progress students make in these role model programs.""
CTE programs help students develop technical and employability skills to enable them to pursue higher education opportunities and enter the workforce. Students in CTE programs may also earn dual credit or credentials and certifications from partner institutions prior to high school graduation. The programs will emphasize recruiting underrepresented students into education careers to help meet the high demand for teachers of color across Illinois. Nearly $2 million in total funding has been awarded to 11 Education for Employment Systems statewide to recruit and support future educators at 62 high schools and vocational centers across the state.

By a 7-1 margin, trustees agreed Monday to move forward with a pilot program at Verilife, a medical cannibas dispensary at 1816 S. Arlington Heights Road.
Mayor Thomas Hayes was the lone dissenting vote, citing at the virtual meeting previous comments he's made on the matter.
""I believe with all my heart that allowing the sale of recreational marijuana in Arlington Heights would be the wrong thing to do and would not enhance the quality of life, and in fact, would diminish the quality of life in Arlington Heights and the reputation that this village has earned for many, many decades now,"" Hayes said previously.
According to Village Manager Randall Recklaus, Village staff have discussed some issues and concerns they have regarding the arrangement in correspondence with Verilife. He said the pilot program will be exclusive to Verilife.
""We're hoping to be able to put this [an ordinance] in front of the board by late August or early September for further discussion and a vote,"" Recklaus said.

Aware of the dire impact the recent coronavirus restrictions will have on our local restaurants, Mayor Tom Hayes and the Village Board will be working with regional community leaders to have immediate dialogue with the Governor's Office regarding recent restrictions that call for temporarily suspending indoor dining and bar service. Please review his message to our community…
Dear Residents and Businesses,
The past 7-8 months have been difficult for us all. Unfortunately, the light we were beginning to see at the end of the tunnel this summer has grown dimmer as a result of the COVID-19 resurgence.
In that regard, Governor Pritzker's recent mitigation Orders prohibiting indoor dining will make it very difficult for our restaurants to survive the fast-approaching winter months. Rest assured that I, and the Village Board, share your concern for our restaurants and businesses. As has been the case since the beginning of the pandemic, the challenge is to find the right balance between health/safety and economic reality as we provide for the health, safety, and welfare of 76,000 residents and the entire community. While the Village continues to monitor and thoughtfully respond to the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases, we must take great care to do so without unnecessarily burdening residents or businesses.
I am currently working with other regional leaders to begin immediate dialogue with the Governor's Office on these new restrictions and to revisit whether they are truly based on the best data available. In the interim, we will continue to encourage compliance with all IDPH and CDC guidelines and leave enforcement of the Governor's Orders to the appropriate state and county agencies. You can help during this time by supporting our restaurants and businesses with curbside pick-up and delivery, enjoying Arlington Alfresco while it remains open, and by sending messages of support/encouragement.
As we approach the holiday season, please be wise in planning your family gatherings. Most importantly, let's give thanks for all of the blessings in our lives despite our current circumstances. I remain confident that we will get back to at least a new normal in 2021 and look forward to seeing you all again at community events next year.
Sincerely,


Tom Hayes, Mayor of Arlington Heights
In addition to the efforts of Mayor Hayes and the Village Board, the Village will continue to listen to and support our business community through this crisis.
The Health & Human Services Department will field any and all complaints on the recent Governor's Orders and will relay them to the appropriate agencies for enforcement.
As the Village works toward finding regional solutions to this matter, everyone is encouraged to remain diligent in following the Illinois Department of Public Health's and Centers for Disease Control's best practices when it comes to mitigating the spread of COVID-19. We are all in this fight together to stop the spread of Coronavirus.

Staff and consultants are submitting the application for Illinois Transportation Enhancement Program Funds for the Downtown Arlington Heights Streetscape pedestrian, bicycle, and accessibility infrastructure enhancement project.

The enhancements the Village is hoping to make include:

In the United States, these complete streets are a distinct concept where equal priority is given to all modes of transportation including automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians, usually with separate rather than shared right-of-way.
The Village stated that the reason for making these types of improvements and adding amenities downtown is keep the Arlington Heights downtown ""on the cutting edge."""
