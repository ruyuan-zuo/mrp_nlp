Carol Kuniholm, chair and co-founder of Fair Districts PA and board member of the League of Women Voters of PA, will be the featured speaker on Tuesday, Feb. 19 at 7 PM at the Free Library of Northampton Township, 25 Upper Holland Road in Richboro. Redistricting Reform: The Journey Continues, a public presentation organized by the League of Women Voters of Bucks County (LWVBC), will give people the opportunity to learn what the legislative path forward in 2019 is for reform in Harrisburg. Partisan gerrymandering in PA will be addressed, as will progress toward the reforms advocated by Fair District PA and its coalition partners. The League of Women Voters in Pennsylvania has long recognized that both political parties, when in power, use gerrymandering to their advantage and has been working for redistricting reform since 1990. In addition to her work with both of these nonpartisan groups, Carol Kuniholm received a PhD in literature from the University of Pennsylvania, taught literature and writing at the college level, and worked for over a decade as a youth pastor. In the event on inclement weather, the presentation will be rescheduled to Tuesday, Feb. 26 at 7PM.
The tactics of a few in power in Harrisburg shut down reform and ensured the status quo during the last legislative session despite the tremendous support among both parties for legislation that would have transformed the redistricting process to one handled by an impartial, transparent, and accountable system. ""For too long, policies supported by a majority of Pennsylvanians, common sense solutions that would benefit us all, have been blocked and stalled by special interests and partisan leaders,"" said Kuniholm in December at a Fair Districts PA rally in Harrisburg.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared that Pennsylvania's 2011 congressional district map violated the state constitution. After the 2020 census, Pennsylvania will draft and create new district maps. If the redistricting process isn't changed, the 2021 map will likely be gerrymandered too."

Seibert, CPA, president of the Pennsylvania Institute of CPAs. To submit a letter to the editor at Patch, please email justin.heinze@patch.com. Letters are written by readers and are not reflective of the views of Patch or its employees.
Dear Editor,
The time for tax reform is now, and members of the Pennsylvania Institute of CPAs encourage Congress to address the core issues of good tax policy. Compliance hurdles for taxpayers, administrative complexity, and enforcement challenges for the IRS are primary obstacles in need of change.
Making the business case for the need for change, CPAs note that the last tax reform package was passed more than 30 years ago, and the year-by-year fixes over that time have made it challenging for business owners and entrepreneurs to strategically grow their business. New regulations and extender bills passed annually make it difficult for taxpayers to manage their tax obligations. When cash flow is uncertain, it affects a business owner's ability to hire and expand. America's entrepreneurs need a tax code that is simple, transparent, and certain.
CPAs have long advocated for a tax system that uses a consistent definition of taxable income without any phaseouts. New tax legislation should provide a clear definition of taxable income, simple and transparent tax rate schedules that are applied consistently across all rate brackets, and elimination of additional surtaxes. A taxpayer should understand their tax obligation and be able to plan accordingly.
Pennsylvania CPAs believe in good tax policy, and use 10 guiding principles, as outlined in the PICPA's ""Guiding Principles of Good Tax Policy"" when analyzing a tax law or tax change. Some of these principles include equity and fairness, effective tax administration, simplicity, and economic growth and efficiency.
This framework can help policymakers build an effective roadmap to analyze proposals addressing changes to existing tax laws and has been shared with all members of the Pennsylvania delegation to Congress.
Sincerely,

Joseph E. Seibert, CPA
President – PICPA
