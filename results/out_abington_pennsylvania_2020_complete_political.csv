The move comes as the state works to reach compliance with the mandate to execute universal testing in all long term care facilities in Pennsylvania.
""This partnership strengthens and increases access to ensure universal testing is completed in nursing homes, as required in the order issued earlier this month,"" Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said in a statement. ""It will provide us the opportunity to better address outbreaks and work to prevent future outbreaks in nursing home facilities.""
CVS will administer up to 50,000 tests for nursing residents and staff members. The tests are free and will begin next Monday, June 29.
Facilities will be tested based on a three-tiered priority list that considers homes with new outbreaks, ongoing outbreaks, resolved outbreaks, and no outbreaks, in that order.
Nursing homes have been especially hard hit by the virus, particularly in Pennsylvania, where many counties have seen more than 80 percent of their deaths due to coronavirus in long term care facilities.
A total of 678 facilities in Pennsylvania have confirmed a positive case of the virus, with 3,162 employees and 17,527 residents becoming infected. This has resulted in 4,518 deaths in the state's long term care facilities, as of Friday afternoon.
CVS also offers testing to the general public at certain locations statewide, along with Patient First, Rite Aid, Walmart, and numerous government community testing sites.
The state has a map of all testing sites in Pennsylvania on their website."

The tests are available on a walk-up basis, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. No appointments are needed.
The antibody test is used to determine if someone previously had COVID-19 and not to diagnose an active infection. Antibodies may give full or partial immunity to the coronavirus but it's unknown whether they actually give immunity.
Patients are eligible to receive the test at Patient First if they believe they may have had coronavirus already or if they're experiencing symptoms. Anyone age 5 and older may receive the tests.
Patient First recommends waiting at least 14 days after symptoms begin to be tested, as it can take up to two weeks for antibodies to truly develop.
Results will be back to two to five days. Patients can agree to receive results either via text message or phone call.
For most patients, there is no out-of-pocket expense for antibody testing.
Abington Urgent Care is located on 938 Old York Road.
Appointments for testing are made by calling a select designated testing center. Updates about testing sites, instructions about how to make an appointment, and other information is available online here."

The Jenkintown Fire Department's New Recruitment Campaign Encourages Neighbors to Save Neighbors by Volunteering
Jenkintown, Pa. –Now that the town has reached the state's yellow reopening phase, the Jenkintown Fire Department is stepping up its volunteer recruitment effort with a comprehensive outreach campaign. The recruitment slogan and branding, ""Be The Neighbor Who Saves A Neighbor,"" was developed during a brainstorming session between volunteers from both Pioneer and Independence Fire Company. The biggest recruitment tool is a stand-alone website, www.fightjenkintownfires.org , designed to answer volunteer questions and collect inquiries from potential volunteers.
With so many people working outside the area and two career families now the norm rather than the exception, the need for volunteers to staff the fire houses is acute. The campaign will focus on what makes Jenkintown so special: the people, the small town atmosphere and the neighbors who help each other in their time of need.
""It's a hometown feeling, the firehouse has a family kind of atmosphere,"" said Ken Lynch, chief of the Independent Fire Company, which serves Jenkintown along with the Pioneer Fire Company. ""It's neighbor helping neighbor.""
""I am excited,"" added Nicholas Pettinati, chief of the Pioneer Company. ""We always like new members."" Pettinati takes particular pride in mentoring young firefighters.
And you never know what volunteering with the Jenkintown Fire Department will bring.
Jacklyn Boutcher felt so strongly about the fire company that she encouraged her roommate, Annabelle Moreno, to join. Flash forward 10 years and Moreno is now married to Scott Smyth, a lieutenant at Pioneer who she met through volunteering.
""This is such a wonderful group of individuals,"" said Moreno, about the Jenkintown Fire Department. ""Being part of their family is an honor.""
Training and gear is provided at no charge and no experience is needed. Volunteer opportunities include:
*Firefighter: Train to fight fires and respond to traffic accidents, hazardous material (HAZMAT) events, rescues and other dangerous situations.
*Fire Police: The fire police are attached to the Pioneer Fire Company. Their primary duty is to ensure the safety of firefighters going to and from the fire scene. They also direct traffic at the scene and provide security and crowd control. The fire police prevent thieves from accessing a burned building until it can be boarded up, as well.
*Contributing Members: Contributing members are needed for administrative tasks, fundraising or serving on the board. The Jenkintown Fire Department also sponsors the annual 4th of July Parade. There's plenty to do besides fighting fires.
*Junior Firefighter: Age 14 through 17. Teenagers can train and learn the skills they need to become a firefighter when they turn 18.
The Borough of Jenkintown applied for a Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (SAFER) grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to cover the cost of the campaign. No local tax money will be needed to run the four-year recruitment campaign.
""The grant has provided our community and our two fire companies a wonderful opportunity to collaborate on something that is so important to the safety of our community – growing our base of volunteer firefighters, "" said George Locke, Manager of Jenkintown Borough.
The Communication Solutions Group Inc., a full-service public relations and marketing firm based in Jenkintown, was hired to implement the program. The company has successfully run numerous recruitment and retention campaigns for fire and rescue organizations including Darby Fire Company #1, Paoli Fire Company, the Abington Township Fire Department and many others.

The peaceful protest was joined by officers from the Abington Police Department, who knelt alongside protesters in a sign of solidarity.
Numerous demonstrators marched through town, starting at the high school, passing by the hospital, and gathering before the township building and police headquarters. Roads were closed to faciliated the march. Rain fell during protest but the crowd continued undeterred.
At one point the crowd knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. That was in solidarity with the amount of time that Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is accused of kneeling on Floyd's neck until he died. Police officers joined in taking a knee.
In addition to the local student organizers from Abington Senior High School, several area organizations joined in the demonstration, including the First Baptist Church of Crestmont.
Protesters carried signs and wore shirts reading ""I Can't Breathe"" and ""8 Minutes 46 Seconds."" Police held signs reading ""Blue N Black not Black N Blue.""
Many protesters wore masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Some protesters adhered to social distancing protocols.
In a statement, police said the event was ""both inspiring and encouraging.""
""The event was extremely peaceful and served to be a model for what a peaceful protest should look like,"" the statement read. ""We look forward to working together to bring about meaningful change. We are all in this together and, in order to bring about peace we need to remember that we belong to one another. Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Floyd and his family. May he rest in peace!""
A peaceful vigil in Floyd's honor, and in memory of all people of color unjustly killed, is also planned at the corner of Old York Road and Township Line Road on Friday, June 5, at 4 p.m. Attendees are asked to bring canned goods and non-perishable items for the needy if they can."

Occupation
Finance Officer for Cheltenham township
Previous or Current Elected or Appointed Office
Cheltenham Finance Officer (2018-present, elected)
Trustee for Montgomery County Community College (2018-present, appointed)
Cheltenham School Board (2011-2017, elected for two terms)
Campaign website
www.napoleonfor154.com
Why are you seeking elective office?
Our campaign platform is anchored in fighting for public education, community investment and real tax reform, but we know that there is far more work to do. I will fight for middle class families and workers, small businesses, minority communities, and all those that Harrisburg has ignored for so long. I am a champion for the role Government is supposed to play in our lives.
The single most pressing issue facing our state/nation is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our state and nation is the faith, expectation, and implementation of our Democracy. From gerrymandering to our low ethical expectations of elected officials to our poor off-year voting trends, to just the way we talk about those on the other side of the isle, our execution of Democracy is NOT moving us forward. We are not prepared to handle our environmental crisis or to adequately educate our children. We are not prepared for health pandemics, global leadership, or to control the traffic along our streets. When elected, I will support the drawing of fair districts, invest state funds in support of local journalism, advance civics curriculum in our schools, hire staff from both parties and from backgrounds that reflect the diversity of the 154th to my team, and champion progressive solutions not just here in our district, but all across the state of Pennsylvania.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am the only candidate in this race with experience in education system governance. I am the only candidate in this race with significant insight into the impact of our tax policies on seniors, businesses, and every other resident. I am also the only elected official from the largest municipality in this district and have been elected township wide three times.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
My top three platform priorities are:
Safe, equitable, rigorous and fully funded public schools.
Tax reform that protects seniors and small businesses instead of industrial polluters and internet giants.
Investing in our communities with legislation to reduce inequalities based on race, religion, and socio-economic status. This includes improving healthcare access, social justice, protecting our civil rights, and dealing with the existential threat of this climate crisis.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I am proud of what I have already done to help my community. Within my educational governance roles, we have built new schools, invested in innovative programs and instruction, crafted discipline and policing policies that were more responsive to the expectations of students, and passed policies that demonstrate first-rate fiscal governance. In the tax office, we just wrapped up a phenomenal year with outstanding collection rates, and more importantly, we are providing more resources to residents and businesses than ever before. We're not just talking about what we can do to help, but we're executing.
In response to the COVID-19 crisis, I redirected my campaign staff to identify and address the needs of residents, non-profits and businesses across the 154th district. We now hold weekly Business Roundtables, host a Facebook group to facilitate the identification of needs and solutions, and work on a daily basis to facilitate solutions for residents that need assistance. I have spent the past several weeks working behind the scenes with the County Commissioners, the county solicitor's office, the leadership at Montgomery County Community College, and our local elected officials and we are finally seeing movement on local property and business tax extensions! COVID-19 is having a significant health and economic impact on our communities. I am happy to have worked with our governing partners to respond to the needs of our community during this time. On Thursday the 26th, the Cheltenham and Springfield Township Boards of Commissioners extended local tax deadlines.
The best advice ever shared with me was …
My grandfather would always tell me to ""Do good, no matter who is looking.""
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
Public policy and governance is about serving your community. As an African American man from Philadelphia who is raising a family in Cheltenham, I am deeply connected to a community that spans from Southwest Philadelphia to Montgomery County. Serving this community demands that we focus on how we educate and nurture our children to achieve successful adult lives, how we care for our seniors, and how we establish a social safety network that meets the needs of vulnerable community members. We need policy makers who are dedicated to supporting small business owners who must care for their children and aging parents, families struggling with healthcare challenges and are facing bankruptcy and homelessness, residents who struggle with crumbling infrastructure and communities that need to broaden the tax base with development projects that serve comprehensive community rather than special interests. I recently spoke with a WWII veteran living in an assisted living facility that no longer serves fresh food on clean dishes or maintains a staff who monitor medications in a safe manner. I also spoke with residents concerned with delays to road and gas pipeline work that impacts the livability of their neighborhoods and business development plans that would expand the tax base but cause excessive congestion.
I will advocate for access to quality preschool, full day kindergarten for all students, and 21st century K-12 public schools that incorporate support for students living with mental health challenges, learning differences, hunger and homelessness with qualified teachers and counselors from diverse backgrounds.
My policy priorities for seniors involve advocating for health outcomes, transportation, tax reforms, and enforcement of licensing and inspections to ensure the safety and security of our most vulnerable in assisted living and nursing homes.
My civil rights and criminal justice reform policies will promote significant reforms to protect voting rights, reform bail and pre-trial detention for indigent defendants, establish community policing initiatives that ensure accountability and transparency in police conduct and eliminate profiling, incorporate police collaboration with broad based social service agencies to reduce over policing.
My top three policy initiatives once elected are:
Establish a pipeline of mental health, school nurses, diverse educators, skilled laborers, and other positions of need that recruits from early high school years and ends with scholarships and loan forgiveness.
Establish a property tax freeze for seniors across the state and build a rebate program for low income individuals that ties their tax rebate to a share of their assets.
Expand the definition of local business presence (or nexus) to close the significant loopholes that allow internet and cellular businesses to avoid paying the same local taxes that our small local businesses must pay."

Two of the service members in the skies on Tuesday were actually graduates from Montgomery County high schools.
Lieutenant Commander Adam Kerrick, a Huntingdon Valley native, graduated from Abington High School in 2001. He even took an aerial photo during the flyover of Montgomery County:

Serving alongside Kerrick was a Willow Grove native, Commander Todd Royles, who graduated from Upper Moreland High School with the class of 1997.
""We want to thank both of them, and the entire Blue Angel team, for bringing a little joy to our lives yesterday,"" Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh said Wednesday.
Royles has served with the Blue Angels since Sept. 2019, and has accumulated more than 2,800 flight hours, according to the Navy. He's also been decorated with numerous service medals for a career that includes missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Kerrick, who lettered in football and lacrosse while at Abington, also served as a fireman at McKinley Fire Company before his military career. He's flown more than 1,600 flight hours in his distinguished, medal-earning career, which has included deployments in the western Pacific and Operation Enduring Freedom.
The flight path included parts of Montgomery County, including a direct flyover of Abington High School.
The flyovers were a show of appreciation to first responders, essential workers, and others still working to keep people heavy and America running amid the pandemic."

It's safe to say that ""the southeastern part of the state will be among the last to reopen,"" Gov. Wolf said during a call with reporters on Thursday, citing the already high and continually growing number of cases of the virus in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties.

Montgomery County was the first county in the state to be shut down, as courts, schools, community centers, and other public places have been closed since March 12.
While Montgomery County was briefly the epicenter of the virus, Philadelphia saw an exponential rise that has it leading all counties in the state with 10,090 cases, as of Wednesday.
The next two counties will the most cases are Montgomery (3,395) and Delaware (2,902).
While Chester is doing a bit better than its neighbors with 989 cases, the comparatively populous eastern Pennsylvania counties account for the next highest numbers: Lehigh with 2,418, Berks with 2,212, and Bucks with 2,131.
>>Gov. Wolf Unveils 3-Phased, Color-Coded Reopening Plan By Region
There is concern that leaving all decisions on reopening in the hands of individual counties would be shortsighted. The state has a broader perspective in looking at regional data, Gov. Wolf said, and decisions need to be made
There is concern, for example, that reopening one county with low cases could expose it to a neighboring county that has a high number of cases, due to the amount of travel between neighboring counties.
Howevere, there are parts of the state have been barely touched by the virus, a geographical reality that state officials are aware of as they continue to plan exactly how the state will reopen.
""Our state is big enough that we can do this in phases,"" Gov. Wolf added. ""What's good for Tioga County's not good for Montgomery County.""
Pennsylvania has announced a three-phase reopening plan, coded by color into stages: red, yellow, green, the governor explained. Each region of the state will be assigned a color, which will determine what mitigation measures previously set to stop the spread of the virus can be lifted, if any. The governor said he plans to analyze the north-central and northwest regions first, with a target of moving from them from red to yellow on May 8.
""The goal here is to keep peope safe,"" Gov. Wolf said Thursday. ""Not to place unreasonable restriction on people's movements.""
A timeline for the length of each phase was not provided, and will likely vary by region based on the current data. To determine when it may be safe to move to a new phase, the state has partnered with Carnegie Mellon University to develop a data tool using Department of Health metrics, looking at a variety of measures including the amount of cases per capita. To reopen, the target goal is an average of less than 50 cases per 100,000 people over a period of 14 days.
He added that he thought Pennsylvania was doing well overall, considering its size as the fifth most populous state in the nation.
Pennsylvania has seen 35,600 cases of the virus and 1,622 deaths as of early Wednesday.

The discovery of the first newly hatched specimen of the devastating invasive bug marks the beginning of their season, and is a stark reminder for residents to be vigilant in killing egg masses whenever they see them.
The bug was located by a US Department of Agriculture employee in the University City section of Philadelphia on Monday.
Officials said that the first hatches are typically around mid to late April, and usually hit the southern part of Pennsylvania first.
They added that residents should use the coronavirus crisis and quarantine measures to spend the time addressing the issue near their homes.
""Let's use this time at home to make a positive impact on Spotted Lanternfly this season; scrape and destroy any remaining egg masses you find and band your trees now,"" said Agriculture Secretary Redding. ""We need every Pennsylvanian to keep their eyes peeled for this bad bug, we can't let our guard down.""
The spotted lanternfly causes massive economic and environmental damage as it feeds on plants and trees, destroying forests, vineyards, and orchards and destabilizing ecosystems as it progresses.
Studies have shown the inch-long plant hopper, a native to China, India, and Vietnam, could cost the Pennsylvania economy up to $324.9 million a year, and lead to the loss of 2,810 jobs.
Having the general public scrape egg masses is one the key tools in the fight against the bug. Use a putty knife, credit card, or other firm, blunt-edged tool to scrape. A helpful tutorial on this process is here, courtesy of Penn State Extension.
Report all sightings or squashed lanterflies online.
Since it was first discovered in the United States in Berks County in 2014, the spotted lanternfly has spread to New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia and Maryland.

>>>Stay up-to-date on coronavirus developments — sign up for Patch news alerts
As Montgomery County has a mostly Democratic delegation to the state house, most local representatives, including several in the Abington area, voted against the bill.
The bill would allow certain businesses to reopen so long as they followed the health advisories laid out for businesses by the CDC and the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Specifically, Republicans are targeting the reopening of construction businesses, auto dealers, and real estate offices. They argue that these businesses are open in other states and that Gov. Wolf's shutdown order of nonessential businesses, in place since mid-March, is too restrictive.
""We have to fight the COVID-19 crisis, but we also have to prevent the collapse of Pennsylvania's economy,"" House Speaker Mike Turzai wrote in a social media statement earlier this week. ""(Gov. Wolf) should work with the legislature to allow citizens to return to safe working environments within the parameters of CDC and Homeland Security guidance so they can put food on the table.""
Democrats argue that now is not the time to lift measures, and that prematurely reopening the economy will prolong the crisis and lead to overwhelming the healthcare system.

Why are you seeking elective office?
To be the effective leader our community deserves. With four daughters and two grandchildren, I want to make sure we have a thriving community where we can raise and educate our families, earn a living and afford to retire. In order to address the serious issues in our community such as inequitable school funding, crumbling infrastructure, devastating effects of climate change, gun violence, and access to affordable healthcare, we need not only a strong voice in the legislature, but an advocate that knows how to get results.
The single most pressing issue facing our state/nation is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
It is almost impossible to choose just one and a good leader knows how to handle several issues at the same time, but there are only certain ones that you can impact at the state level. At the top of my list of priorities is education: we are failing our children with public schools that are underfunded, unsafe and inadequate. Equitable school funding and charter school reform would allow our community to invest in its most precious resource, our children. Specifically, reforming the outdated Sterling Act and charter school reform would bring millions back to our district and reduce the tax burden on our residents, including our seniors, who should be able to live out their lives in the community where they have raised their families. Those funds would allow us to expand educational opportunity for every child at every level, freeze property taxes for our senior citizens and to address climate change impacts by investing in electric buses and green building technology.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I have 20 years experience with state and local government, school districts, hospitals and universities, including work in Harrisburg as the Chief Counsel for the Department of Revenue and Deputy General Counsel. I have drafted, negotiated and passed legislation and budgets in the legislature, I'm prepared to be effective from my first day in office. Anyone can make empty promises, I know my past work in Harrisburg would allow me to deliver.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
In addition to fair educational funding for our schools, I will fight to pass common-sense gun laws, find and fund alternative energy solutions and infrastructure improvements to address climate change, and transportation funding to fix our crumbling roads and bridges and increase access to public transportation. I have long worked for positive change in my community and this includes criminal justice reform, advocating for the protection of a woman's right to choose, access to affordable healthcare and LGBTQ+ rights.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?

At heart I am a mom who is fighting for a future for my children and grandchildren. I was raised by a single mother on a small family-owned farm. Economic insecurity was always knocking at my door and I want to work to make sure no one in our community faces the tough choices we made. I was given an opportunity to be lifted out of poverty by a good public school education and will fight to make sure that same opportunity is available for all of our children. I am a pragmatic progressive with the experience and skills to understand the critical issues impacting our community and craft solutions that make a real, positive difference."

Neil I. Mittin, 64, of Huntingdon Valley, will spend the next five years behind bars, U.S. District Court Judge Michael M. Baylson ruled Thursday. He also must pay $3.4 million to restitution.
Mittin worked as a personal injury lawyer for 38 years at Gay and Checker, a Philadelphia law firm located Spring Garden Street. He pleaded guilty to mail fraud in Sept. 2019, and had his law license suspended for a year by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in Nov. 2019.
""He cheated his colleagues, misled and poached his clients, and pocketed the proceeds in the form of referral fees,"" Tara A. McMahon, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Philadelphia Division. ""He'll now be held to account for this decade-long, multimillion-dollar fraud.""
Beginning in 2008, Mittin began putting aside a number incoming clients — some personal injury matters, some other types — and then referring them to attorneys in other firms, officials said.
He did so without the clients asking, and often without them even knowing or understanding that they'd been referred elsewhere. He was able to keep it under wraps from his employer by closing the files on those clients, making it appear that a settlement or resolution was impossible, and the case therefore not one that should be taken on by the firm.
The outside attorneys, in turn, paid Mittin a referral fee of around 33 to 40 percent of the fees received by the attorneys if the case in question was resolved successfully, officials said. All told, the personal injury matters that Mittin sold made about $10.80 million in settlements and recoveries, and Mittin himself made about $4.2 million the US Attorney's Office said.
The scheme continued for a full decade, up through 2018, authorities said."

Why are you seeking elective office?
I am running so that I can bring my 20 years of experience in the public and private sectors to serve the needs of the 154th District. My extensive experience in regional business development, community government programs and human rights will prove to be an asset to our community in lowering our property taxes, increasing accessibility and making our community a more attractive place to live and thrive. Our present incumbents are just not doing enough to make sure our area is affordable and will be a viable community for years to come.
The single most pressing issue facing our state/nation is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
I consider climate change the base for all issues in the state. Climate change actively affects our productivity and viability as a state that relies heavily on its natural resources to succeed. Our fracking operations must be taxed appropriately and must be heavily regulated as they are a huge contributor to our climate and environmental degradation. Our cost to reverse the effects of climate degradation are in the hundreds of millions and completely justify our immediate investment in green energy alternatives.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
That I am not a township incumbent. Our incumbents have absolutely no state level experience and have presided over our brutal property taxation that is keeping employers and investors away from our area. Our budget is presently balanced in the backs of our homeowners. They just do not have the experience to build a new revenue model that protects our schools and lowers our taxes. Our neighbors are leaving their homes and if we do not act now our community will simply fade away.
I am an expert in government grants and policies to develop communities. My experience in the private sector gives me the tools to bring the right long term development to our district. I have been appointed by three US Governors in positions ranging from legislative affairs to emergency management coordination and have the experience to bring the best results to our district.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the incumbent failed the district?
Rep. Steve McCarter, our present incumbent for the 154th District is retiring. He has done a great job and we need a qualified State Representative to build on his legacy from day one. This is why I consider that my relevant state level experience makes me the best candidate to build on his legacy.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform
This is only a two year position that demands targeted results that benefit our district directly. We cannot prioritize issues that even is successful will be diluted through Pennsylvania.
My three main issues are,
1) Developing our abandoned business corridors to bring investment in our communities to lower property taxes while protecting our school system. Our township taxation are very high and our residents are simply leaving their homes. This is devastating to the values of our properties and increases our taxes at 2% per year.
2) ADA compliance and accessibility. At present, we do not have a single zip code in our district that has sidewalks and easements to provide safe enjoyment of our community to our families with young children, our disabled and our wheelchair users. We have an aging community and our present incumbents have ignored this problem for over 10 years.
3) Build on Steve McCarter's legacy and leadership of community service, union protection, climate change issues, gun control and LGBT rights.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have spear headed projects that develop areas to take full advantage of transportation development. I have advised three US Governors in the development of a sustainable business communities to keep taxes low and increase long term population in defined areas. I have created grants to develop communities.
My state level experience is tailored to what our present needs are in the district and it makes me the best candidate for District 154th.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I have the proven state level experience to make sure our community thrives for years to come. As a two year position, this is not an office where you can learn on the job. My experience as an appointed adviser for three Governors qualify me in ways the other candidates are not."

The study, ""Breath to the People,"" was put together by the Environmental Integrity Project, in partnership with the United Church of Christ. The project notes the total number of reporter air releases, inhalation toxicity, population within one mile, and number of children under the age of 5 within a mile.
The study includes 100 industrial facilities which it says contribute the most to toxic air pollution in heavily populated areas around the country. The Environmental Integrity Project, a research firm, analyzed self-reported data from 15,500 facilities around the nation.
The following Pennsylvania facilities are on the list. The facilities are listed in order of the inhalation toxicity, a number included in parentheses.
22. B. Braun Medical Inc Manufacturing Division, Allentown (25.65)

""This report is our latest attempt to draw attention to the many threats posed by industrial pollution—especially to those living in close proximity the emission sources—and to provide common-sense and long-lasting solutions,"" Courtney Bernhardt, research director for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement.
Eight of the top nine polluters were from Louisiana and Texas. The leader on the list was Huntsman Petrochemical LLC in Port Neches, Texas, with an inhalation toxicity of 235.75.

In the ramp up to the Nov. 3 election, with President Donald Trump facing former Vice President Joe Biden, campaigns have been and still are raising funds.
But who is raising more money where?
A new report from the New York Times breaks down which ZIP codes are raising more money for either candidate. The analysis documents the number of estimated donors by ZIP code from April through June.
In the Abington area, Biden holds a decisive advantage:
19027
Biden:366

19012
Biden 61
Trump: 19

Trump: 110
19046
Biden: 314
Trump: 84
Overall in Pennsylvania, the Times reports Biden has 66,000 estimated donors compared to Trump's 45,000. Pennsylvania is Biden's home state.
The Philadelphia suburbs recently saw a heavy shift toward voting Democrat with many areas, such as Chester and Delaware counties, voting in an entirely Democratic county council.
In 2016, suburban Philadelphia was considered a bellwether for the general election.
Trump won 2,970,733 — or 48.18 percent — of the vote in Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton won 2,926,441 votes — or 47.46 percent — in Pennsylvania.
If the suburbs are still considered a bellwether for November's results, the donor data leans heavily in favor of Biden.

The moratorium against evictions and foreclosures expired in Pennsylvania last month and has not been renewed, despite extensive calls to do so.
Abington's funding includes $306,687 to be used to provide temporary financial assistance for households for up to six months.
""Many Americans have lost their jobs during this pandemic and are facing the possibility of being evicted, through no fault of their own,"" Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Bob Casey said in a statement announcing the funding. ""This funding is essential to providing support for Pennsylvanians who need temporary financial assistance to pay rent and weather the eviction crisis that the COVID-19 pandemic has created.""
To determine who received the funding, officials looked at communities with industries that suffered high job loss rates during the pandemic, as well as concentrations of those most at risk for transmission of the virus. They also considered areas with high unemployment and a high risk of eviction.
Montgomery County residents are also eligible for up to $1,500 a month in rent and utility relief through the Your Way Home Emergency Rent and Utility Commission. Eligible households can receive a maximum of $9,000 in reimbursement, or six months worth of payments, the county said, dating back to March 1.

""Keeping people in their homes and preventing an influx of homelessness is critical to the health and safety of Montgomery County households,"" Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh said in a statement. ""It is also a major contributing factor in the recovery from the impacts of COVID-19.""
Statistics tracked by the county using Esri's Business Analyst tool estimate that there are 96,664 renters in the county; between 29 and 43 percent of those renters are estimated at ""severe"" risk of eviction by the end of the year due to the economic stressors caused by coronavirus.

A proposal is on the table to create a new Economic Development Corporation specifically for Abington, which would give the township greater flexibility in undertaking broad community redevelopment and growth initiatives.
The matter will be addressed at an upcoming Abington Board of Commissioners public information session on Sept. 23.
According to the formal proposal, the corporation would focus on ""the acquisition, remediation, remodel, repair, and redevelopment of blighted properties located
within Abington Township's geographic limits, with the goal of putting such properties back on the tax rolls and utilizing said properties in accordance with their highest and best uses, as well as cultivating, developing and encouraging economic development within the same.
Economic development corporations have been utillized to great effect everywhere from Phoenixville to Philadelphia. The ""quasi-governmental"" identity is part agency, part nonprofit, part business.
The chief difference between the proposed corporation and the Board's current Economic Development Committee is that the corporation can act on its own accord.
The Board of Commissioners would be responsible for appointing the members and leaders of the corporation. The township would fund the corporation with $100,000 in seed money to get off the ground, officials said.

This is in large part due to the cooperation of sports leagues and schools with county officials and contact tracers. It's part of an improvement across the board: the county said they now have a 96 percent cooperation rate with all contact tracing in the county.
""That is really great, and a lot better than we were doing previously,"" Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh said this week.
Large social gatherings like parties, family events, and vacations continue to be the cause of the ""bulk"" of all of the county's actual transmissions, contact tracers have found.
In turn, these individuals go on to infect and expose other groups like schools, daycares, work settings, and, of course, youth sports leagues. But, thus far, anyway, actual games and practices are not resulting in spread of the virus itself, just exposure to it.
The distinction is an important one for the leaders of local leagues who are taking the virus seriously and have worked exhaustively to put strong safety protocols in place.
""It is crucial as elected Little League leaders of our community that we take away the word ""CAN'T"" from kids vocabulary and make sure they understand the word CAN,"" Jason Eric Saylor, the president of Lower Perkiomen Little League, told Patch, pointing to the success in his own league at protecting players and coaches.
A total of 130 individuals have been put in quarantine in Montgomery County since May due to exposure to the virus. At any given time, Arkoosh said the county is monitoring several different teams which have been exposed to the virus.
Gov. Wolf's recently amended official state guidance says that all organized sports should be delayed in the state until 2021. There's been pushback from the PIAA on the issue, which plans on making a final decision on high school sports Friday afternoon. Groups of families and athletes have also protested, arguing officials have not taken the mental health impacts seriously enough.
""When a player tells me he can't pitch or he can't catch- we don't give up- we create a process so the player learns that he CAN pitch and CAN catch,"" Saylor added. ""That is the same process of not shutting down our league - we CAN do things , when we put our collective minds together - that is what makes LP a great community!""
The latest guidance from state and county officials still recommends, not requires, that residents avoid ""congregate"" settings, defined in Pennsylvania as more than 25 people, where possible. But the note that leagues have not yet seen spread, only exposure, reflects the strength of the safety protocols put in place by local leagues and schools, and the importance of their close cooperation with county authorities, officials said.
Arkoosh did note that stopping any exposure was even more important as some schools begin to reopen.
""Especially as we get back to the fall, we really hope to minimize the exposure of young people,"" she said.
In addition to an improvement on cooperation with contact tracing, the county has also seen significant improvements in mask wearing.
Officials are also monitoring other settings like daycares, along with youth sports leagues. A total of 50 individuals have been quarantined as a result of exposure there since May."
25,/pennsylvania/abington/pa-coronavirus-positivity-rate-drops-statewide-again,2020-08-14T20:31:43Z,PA Coronavirus Positivity Rate Drops Statewide...,4,115,Justin Heinze,Patch Staff,"PENNSYLVANIA — One of the most important key metrics used by Pennsylvania health officials to measure the course of the virus continues to decline.
That metric, the percent of all coronavirus tests which come back positive, dropped down to 4.0 percent this week, from 4.1 percent over the previous seven-day period. That's the third week in a row in which the rate has dropped, officials noted.
""(That) is a testament to the testing occurring, and that testing is widely available throughout the state,"" Gov. Wolf said in a statement Friday. ""However, with increased testing comes increased case counts. The virus is still circulating, and we must continue to wear masks, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings to keep our numbers low, stop the spread and allow more freedom.""
The data demonstrating the lower rate shows that additional measures put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus are working, the governor said.
Still, the seven-day case increase has slightly risen statewide, up to 5,53o from 5,030 over the previous week. Officials note that residents are still participating in mass gatherings and large events, likely contributing to the spread of the virus where it could be eradicated to a more significant degree.
Of nearly 25,000 cases tracked by the state from July 13 to Aug. 11, 52 percent responded to the question of ""have you attended a mass gathering?"" in the two weeks leading up to their positive test. Of those, 12 percent (1,648 people) said ""yes.""
A total of 15 counties still have a ""concerning"" positivity rate. The World Health Organization has said positivity rates should be under 5 percent.
Those counties which officials said should be watched closely include Fayette (10.4 percent), Armstrong (8.9 percent), Cameron (8.7 percent), Huntingdon (7.1 percent), Dauphin (6.5 percent), Northumberland (6.4 percent), Mercer (6.3 percent), Erie (5.9 percent), Crawford (5.8 percent), Forest (5.8 percent), York (5.6 percent), Indiana (5.5 percent), Franklin (5.4 percent), Lawrence (5.3 percent), and Berks (5.0 percent).

Gilbert Newton III, 18, of Philadelphia, is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in the afternoon on charges of first- and third-degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime.
Newton is accused of killing Morgan McCaffery, who was found dead at the Meadowbrook Train Station in Montgomery County at about 8:15 a.m. Monday, July 27.

Police found McCaffery lying in the parking lot next to her running car, covered in blood from apparent stab or cutting wounds to her neck and stomach.
The Montgomery County Coroner's Office determined McCaffery died of more than 30 stab and slash wounds and the manner of death was homicide.
A witness told police seeing a white Jeep leaving the scene, which jumpstarted the investigation.
The investigation showed that McCaffery had broken off a yearlong relationship with Newtown a month before the murder, the Montgomery County District Attorney's office said.
McCaffery went to the train station to meet Newton to discuss their relationship, according to the DA's office.
Newtown was denied bail at his preliminary arraignment due to the murder charge."

Madeleine Dean Condemns Amy Coney Barrett...,0,49,Justin Heinze,Patch Staff,"MONTGOMERY COUNTY, PA -- Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as the newest Supreme Court Justice of the United States on Monday, to the chagrin of Democratic leaders around the nation and in Montgomery County.
Local U.S. Congressswoman Madeleine Dean said that the confirmation of Barrett in the midst of the election, four years after Republicans refused to hear Merrick Garland for seven months in an election year, ""shows a disregard for the democratic process and the American people.""
""As Americans are casting their ballots, Senate Republicans and the (Trump) administration rushed the process of a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land to reap political gain,"" Dean said in a statement Monday night. ""The acceleration of the process before the fast approaching Election Day displays dangerous haste from Senate Republicans.""
Barrett's confirmation tips the balance in the Supreme Court decisively to the right, as conservative justices now have a 6-3 majority. Barrett is President Trump's third's appointee to the Supreme Court following Neal Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, assuring that regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election, some part of Trump's legacy will be woven into the fabric of Washington for decades.
""Appointing Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court may perhaps be the greatest accomplishment of President Trump's first term,"" Montgomery County Commissioner Joe Gale said Tuesday.
The conservative Barrett replaces longtime liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
""She follows a giant,"" Dean said. ""I hope Justice Barrett will remember how far we have come.""
Dean added her concern for issues like abortion and Roe v. Wade, the Affordable Care Act, and immigration under Barrett and the heavily conservative bench.
The Senate confirmed Barrett by a vote of 52-48 on Monday. Every Democrat opposed the confirmation, as did one Republican: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine."

Being a representative in Congress is kind of a big deal. I know this is an obvious statement, but these are the people who represent We the People directly in a way senators and presidents can't. Our congressional representative should reflect precisely what our community wants and needs. They know our towns, our roads, and our schools. They understand what's important to us on a scale that's very different than other federal officials. Madeleine Dean has been my congresswoman for two years and I've done my research on her as a congresswoman and a candidate – and that's why I'm voting for Kathy Barnette on November 3rd.
MAD (as she likes to be called) is a smart woman and no one can deny that, but I feel she's out of touch with the people who elected her two years ago. She's voted with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time – 100%! I don't agree with anyone 100% of the time! This tells me that MAD knows how to tow the party line. Political survival? Perhaps. But I like my politicians a little scrappier than that. I like when they think for themselves and don't just nod their head to everything their party lays across their desk. But hey, if MAD feels she needs to follow Pelosi's lead on everything, that's her decision – I just don't have to vote for her to keep it going.
I also like to see where they're getting their money, so I did some searching. MAD's campaign has more money than Kathy Barnette's, which is to be expected since she's the incumbent. But more than half of MAD's campaign money (over $700,000) comes from PACs according to her last campaign finance report, https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/591/202010159294906591/202010159294906591.pdf. Barnette's percent is significantly lower – by a lot. I also took note that while it appears MAD hasn't contributed any of her own money to her campaign, Kathy Barnette has. This tells me that Barnette is truly invested in her campaign, in every sense of the word. And I believe these numbers help illustrate a larger point. Kathy Barnette really believes in what she's doing and is focused on the individuals in her district (not just the ones with deep pockets), while Madeleine Dean wants to support anyone who can keep her in power, whether that's Nancy Pelosi or those contributing large sums of money to PACs.
The first time I saw Madeleine Dean on the national stage was when Attorney General Bill Barr testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee in July of this year. Forgive me for not noticing her sooner, but she didn't exactly do a lot to get noticed up until then and my house tends to stream more PJ Masks than C-Span. Regardless, I was watching the testimony and suddenly noticed that my congresswoman, Madeleine Dean, was questioning Barr. I was taken aback by how condescending and dismissive she was. When she asked him questions and he tried to answer her, she claimed he was interrupting her and moved on to another point. And near the end of the exchange, she said something that really stuck with me, partly because of the superiority of the statement and partly because of her tone – ""I'm surprised at your lack of respect for a member of Congress."" Well, I was surprised at how she had allowed partisan politics to bleed into everything she does, everything she stands for, and every statement she makes. She could have simply asked her questions, received her answers, and moved on. But no. She felt a need to talk down to the U.S. Attorney General because *gasp* she's a member of Congress.
Politicians shouldn't get involved to simply push their agenda or make a name for themselves. They should get involved to better the lives of the people they represent, but sometimes I think they go to Washington and their priorities shift into gaining power, keeping power, and expanding their power. Madeleine Dean seems like a typical politician to me. She seeks to stay relevant and important and gets her support and money from people with plenty of influence. But unlike MAD, Kathy Barnette isn't a career politician who's been waiting for her big break. She even openly announces that she'll only serve two terms in Congress. Her support comes from normal people who simply want her to represent them when she gets to Washington – and I believe she will. After all, she's been pounding the pavement for months going door-to-door and talking to the people of this community. I can respect that. I can also respect that she's someone who just got tired of complaining about politics and decided to get involved to make a difference. That's the kind of public servant I want fighting for me. That's the kind of woman I want representing me.

An unprecedented number of mail-in ballots are being processed, mailed out, and returned in the county amid the coronavirus pandemic.
But polls will still be open on Election Day, Nov. 3, and based on the number of ballots processed thus far in Montgomery County, at least half of all voters may be choosing to vote in-person.
>>235,000 Ballots Now Mailed Out In Montco: Latest Election Updates
Here's a glance at what you'll find on your ballot in the Abington area.
For nearly all of Montgomery County outside of a small portion in the north-central, voters reside in the 4th District. That race features political newcomer and national conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, who is mounting a challenge to sitting U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean, the longtime state representative from Abington.
>>PA 2020 Election Guide: How To Vote, Who's On The Ballot
The local race for state representative in the 153rd district features sitting Democratic State Rep. Ben Sanchez against Republican Marc Bozzacco.
Of course, the race that has sparked the most passion is between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. In Pennsylvania, Democrats were successful in kicking the Green Party off the ballot, meaning left-leaning voters have the option of Biden or a write-in. The only other name to appear on the ballot for president in Pennsylvania is Libertarian Jo Jorgensen. Jorgensen does not have nearly the support in polls that Libertarian Gary Johnson did in 2016. Johnson won 145,000 votes in Pennsylvania four years ago, good for 2.4 percent of the vote, while the Green Party's Jill Stein won about 50,000, or 0.4 percent.
In state races, incumbent Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro is being challenged by Republican Heather Heidelbaugh, a Pittsburgh attorney, Green Party candidate Richard Weiss, and Libertarian Daniel Wassmer. For auditor general, Democrat Nina Ahmad faces Republican Timothy DeFoor, Green Olivia Faison, and Libertarian Jennifer Moore. For state treasurer, Democrat Joe Torsella will face Republican Stacy Garrity, Green Timothy Runkle, and Libertarian Joe Soloski.

Here's a glance at an official sample ballot for Abington.

Challenging Republican Kathy Barnette, a former corporate finance professor and conservative political commentator that has appeared on national media, is running against incumbent Democrat Rep. Madeleine Dean, a longtime local state representative.
Barnette faces an uphill battle. The ""solid Democratic"" label is applied by most outside election analysts, including the oft-cited Cook Political Report. For Barnette, she understands she is running against an establishment, and she's embraced it, casting herself as an outsider and her background — from an impoverished childhood on a pig farm in Alabama to running for Congress — as emblematic of the American dream.
""I succeeded because no one told me I was a victim,"" Barnette said in a recent campaign advertisement. ""We watch as primarily white liberals come into predominately black communities and tell us what our problems are and how to fix them,"" she added in an editorial published by Fox News following the killing of George Floyd.
Dean's stance on these issues, meanwhile, is clearly quite different.
""(The death of George Floyd) exposed and taught us that there is systemic racism in our police and our institutions,"" Dean said during a recent town hall, echoing the refrain of the Black Lives Matter movement and the voices on the left calling for criminal justice reform.
Much of Barnette's campaign, and her political commentating over the years, has focused on this point: that white, rich (Barnette's ads target Dean's personal wealth) Democrats don't understand black communities. She advocates instead for personal responsibility and giving disenfranchised communities ""a seat at the table.""
Another fundamental philosophical difference between the two candidates is their approach to coronavirus, highlighted during a recent debate put on by the Lower Merion and Narberth League of Women Voters. Dean has been a supporter of the shutdowns and Gov. Wolf's policy since the start of the pandemic. Barnette again offered a different perspective: keeping children home from school disproportionately impacts the poor, and, particularly, minorities.
Dean was first elected during the 2018 midterms when she won a landslide victory over Republican Dan David, 211,240 to 121,467. Dean was among four southeastern Pennsylvania women elected to their first term in Congress during the 2018 ""blue wave,"" which saw sweeping Democratic victories nationwide.
Since her election, Dean has figured prominently in the left wing of the Democratic Party, joining the Progressive Caucus and advocating for other keystone progressive issues: increased minimum wage, universal healthcare, and gun control. She endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in early March, shortly after he took a lead over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary and after the rest of the competition dropped out. She's since campaigned extensively for Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris in Montgomery County.
Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District was newly formed when the state's district maps were redrawn a few years ago. This district now covers entire county save for a small sliver in the north-central. Most of Montgomery County and this district was previously represented by U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, who took over the newly created 2nd district.
While Barnette has clearly articulated a compelling challenge to Dean, there's little to indicate that Montgomery County's position as a blue stronghold has wavered in the past two years.

The first incident occurred back on Christmas Day 2019, at a parlor on the 200 block of West Street Road in Warminster.
Police said Kacewich robbed employees of a purse and three cell phones, while a second person, 26-year-old Devinn Hall, stood as a lookout.
Just four days later, on Dec. 29, Kacewich struck again in Abington Township, this time coming away with about $940 in cash and two more cell phones, according to authorities.
Surveillance footage led detectives to Kacewich, who had several easily identifiable and distinctive tattoos, the Bucks County District Attorney's Office said.
Police took Kacewich into custody on Jan. 2 in Philadelphia, and he pleaded guilty on Sept. 1. He was convicted on charges of robbery, criminal conspiracy, prohibited possession of a firearm, theft, and assault.
His lookout, Hall, was arrested in February and pleaded guilty to similar counts. He is awaiting sentencing."
32,/pennsylvania/abington/pa-election-commission-what-know-controversial-proposal,2020-10-09T15:50:27Z,PA Election Commission: What To Know About...,1,4,Justin Heinze,Patch Staff,"PENNSYLVANIA — A controversial Pennsylvania bill which would create a five-person ""election commission"" to review the conduct of the 2020 election is drawing ire from both sides of the aisle.
The bill recently passed through committee and onto the floor of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Republican creators of the bill say that it's a way to uncover issues and learn from any mistakes made after the fact. Opponents, however, say that the language is (perhaps purposefully) unclear and could undermine the results of the election.
""Pennsylvanians deserve to have their vote counted as they cast it, not decided by five individuals of a 203-member legislative body, five individuals who would effectively speak for over 12 million residents of this commonwealth,"" State Rep. Melissa Shusterman (D-151) said.
The commission, made up of three Republicans and two Democrats from the state House of Representatives, would have the power to subpoena both U.S. Postal Service employees and county election workers, critics say.
The bill was introduced into the legislature by Lycoming County's State Rep. Garth Everett (R-84), who chairs House State Government Committee. It passed through that committee by a 15-10 vote along party lines, and will now go to the House floor. It passed shortly before the House session was canceled due to a legislator testing positive for COVID-19.
Gov. Wolf alleged the bill, House Resolution 1032, was a part of a coordinated effort between certain House Republicans and President Trump to ""put the results of the election in question.""
""This is an unprecedented attack on non-partisan election administrators at a time when we should all be doing everything we can to instill confidence in our elections,"" Wolf added.
Further, the bill has again stoked concerns that in the event of a close election or any controversy over vote tabulation, Pennsylvania House Republicans might look to appoint electors themselves. The Atlantic first reported that the state GOP was considering such a measure in late September, an article which drew sharp condemnation from House Majority Leader Jake Corman.
""I have had zero contact with the Trump campaign or others about how PA chooses electors,"" Corman said on Twitter. The PA process as outlined in the Election Code does not involve the legislature.""
It remains unclear what level of support the election commission might see on the state level, but there are Republicans who stand against it, too.
""I oppose the legislation as currently drafted,"" State Rep. Todd Stephens (R-151) told Patch. ""We should not do anything that could disrupt the voting process or distract our local election officials from the task at hand - ensuring every vote cast is counted properly.""
The nonpartisan Keystone Research Center said that the bill would allow the committee to have ""practically unlimited funding and subpoena power.""
""It could start calling state and county election officials in for questioning now, disrupting their efforts to prepare for the election—or after the election, undermining their effort to count votes,"" the organization wrote in a public letter. ""It could hold public hearings right now that would raise doubts about the process of voting—or after the election, raising doubts about the fairness of counting votes.""
Other critics noted that while they lauded efforts to improve the efficiency of elections, the open-ended language of the bill left things wide open to an abuse of power.
""It seeks to undermine the authority of county-level elections officials and the Department of State to administer safe, secure, and nonpartisan elections,"" State Rep. Liz Hanbidge (D-61) said.
Shusterman added that the ""ill-timed"" proposal comes in the midst of misinformation regarding the integrity of the election, and mail-in voting specifically.
Everett was adamant there was no such malintent or political scheming behind the move.
""People forget sometimes that the Legislature established the Election Code and how elections are conducted,"" Everett told the Lycoming County-based Williamsport Sun-Gazette Tuesday. ""The Department of State doesn't do that. It's well within our authority to provide guidance going forward.""
The Keystone Research Center said that if this was the case, changes needed to be made to the language of the bill to limit the committee's review process to the period after Dec. 14, which is when Pennsylvania's electors are chosen. The group also argued that a committee with such extensive powers should be made up of six members — three Democrats and three Republicans — to prevent partisan corruption.
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives is adjourned until Monday, Oct. 19 after a legislator tested positive for coronavirus last week."

The question of when you will get your ballot, however, is a trickier one.
As officials have said from the beginning, the sooner you request your ballot, the better, and the more likely that it will arrive promptly. But because each county administers this separately, a process which includes approving, printing, and mailing, there is no universal ""receive by"" date. For many, it could be any day.
Many counties, including Philadelphia and Montgomery in southeastern Pennsylvania, have already sent out hundreds of thousands of ballots. Montgomery County officials said that 192,000 ballots received initial approval last week, and printing and mailing of that initial volley will be completed by Oct. 7. They anticipate sending out thousands every day following.
And the other factor which will determine when you receive your ballot is, of course, the U.S. Postal Service, and the degree to which the historic number of mail-in voters this election stresses its capacity.
In Pennsylvania, election remain confident in a secure election, and that voting by mail works.
""Mail-in or absentee voting offers eligible voters a secure, convenient, accessible and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an especially safe option of voting in the privacy of their own homes,"" Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said.
So despite Election Day being a month away, many around the state have already received and cast their ballots. As evidence of local officials' confidence that ballots are being received, Philadelphia began opening some of its 15 satellite voter services offices, where ballots can be dropped off, on Sept. 29. Ballot drop-off boxes opened in 11 different locations on Oct. 3 in Montgomery County.
Statewide, the first ballots were initially cleared for printing back on Sept. 17. It would've happened earlier, but for a court case in which Pennsylvania Democrats were successful in getting the Green Party presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins, kicked off the ballot in the state.
Voters can also check the status of their registration and their ballot — including whether their application has been processed or mailed out — via the state's online portal.
However, this feature can take time to update, and, along with other online services, it was disrupted by an outage that struck the Pennsylvania Department of State over the weekend (Boockvar said ""the outage was due to an issue with the contractor's equipment, and there is no evidence of malicious interference"").

All in-person votes and all mail-in ballots received by 8 p.m. Tuesday are now counted in Montgomery County. Final results are still pending, as around 3,200 late-received votes in the county are yet to be counted. But it's clear that the county turned out for Biden in a way it did not for Hillary Clinton four years ago.
In Abington, Biden sits at 24,628 votes, to Trump's 11,174. In 2016, Clinton earned 21,287 here in Abington, to Trump's 9,983. So while Trump picked up around 1,200 voters, Biden saw 3,300 more voters support him than supported Clinton four years ago.
Biden currently has 3,339,500 votes to Trump's 3,308,548, according to the latest statewide vote tallies from the Associated Press.
Similar results around several other populous municipalities in the county helped push Biden over the edge, both in Pennsylvania and the Electoral College at large.
""The key of the Keystone State,"" the Montgomery County Democratic Committee said.
This was a trend that held countywide: Montgomery County cast 256,082 ballots for Clinton in 2016, and 162,731 for Trump. In 2020, Biden has thus far earned 313,543 votes, to Trump's 182,907.
That the already blue county was leaning further to the left was evidenced in the results of state legislature races in both 2018 and 2020, in which Democrats won victories in many seats that had been held by the GOP for decades.
Among those wins in 2020 was Nancy Guenst's victory in the 152nd District, long held by retiring Republican Rep. Tom Murt.
Elsewhere, Republicans were able to hold off strong challenges in districts that otherwise voted Democrat. In the closest state legislature race in the county in 2020, Rep. Todd Stephens held off a strong challenge from Democrat Jonathan Kassa."

""You know who actively attempts to disqualify lawful votes, incite violence and suppress the right to vote? Wannabe autocrats,"" the post read.
Dean has not issued a response to Barnette's comments, but did accept victory on Tuesday night.
""It has been the honor of my life to serve you these past two years, and I look forward to serving the district with decency and ethics for the next two years,"" she shared.
Barnette's lawsuit was scheduled to be heard in U.S. District Court Wednesday morning."

While final, official results may not be available in Pennsylvania for days, Dean holds a huge enough lead in the heavily blue district that analysts called the race shortly before midnight.
""Thank you to the Fourth Congressional District for your trust and belief in me,"" Dean said on Twitter in announcing victory. ""It has been the honor of my life to serve you these past two years, and I look forward to serving the district with decency and ethics for the next two years.""

With 286 of Montgomery County's 431 precincts reporting, and all of Berks County's 11 precincts in the 4th Congressional District reporting, Dean held a 138,501 to 94,935 lead over Barnette at midnight.
The Democratic stronghold was one of the first Congressional races called in Pennsylvania Tuesday night, as races around the state and the presidential race remained too close to call.
Dean's victory comes as her opponent filed a lawsuit against Montgomery County earlier Tuesday, alleging the county illegally ""pre-canvassed"" ballots for errors, allowing voters to correct mistakes. A hearing is scheduled in court for Wednesday morning. The campaign wants 1,200 votes discarded, but Montgomery County elections officials say that only 49 ballots are impacted.
""I told y'all, I'm not rolling over for felonious foolishness and dishonesty,"" Barnette, a businesswoman and longtime conservative commentator on Fox News, said on Facebook Tuesday afternoon. ""I am a fighter. I will fight for you and your family. Each LEGAL vote matters. Period.""
Barnette did not immediately concede the race on Tuesday evening.
Late Tuesday, elections officials said that it would take 40 hours for all mail-in votes to be counted in Montgomery County, meaning that a final tally may not be available until Thursday at 2 p.m.
A native of the Abington area, Dean served as a Pennsylvania state representative in the 153rd district before being elected to her first term in U.S. Congress in the 2018 midterms. She was a part of the ""blue wave"" which saw several first time U.S. Congresswoman elected that year in southeastern Pennsylvania, including Mary Gay Scanlon and Chrissy Houlahan. Though a member of the Progressive Caucus, she voted in line with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 100 percent of the time during her first two years in office.
Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District was newly formed when the state's district maps were redrawn a few years ago. This district now covers the entire county save for a small sliver in the north-central. It also creeps into 11 precincts in Berks County. Most of Montgomery County and this district was previously represented by U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle, who took over the newly created 2nd district.

The overall tally, including Berks, currently stands at:
10:37 p.m.

Dean: 60,183
Barnette: 14,511

""Montgomery County is already reporting record high voter turnout,"" State Rep. Liz Hanbidge said after polls closed, a sentiment that was echoed by party officials on both sides of the aisle throughout the day Tuesday.
""While this is exciting news, it also means that definitive results may take several days to be confirmed,"" Hanbidge added. ""Please BE PATIENT and remember that the most important thing is that every single vote is counted!""
8:28 p.m.
Dean spent the day in polling locations around Norristown, as well as making campaign stops in North Wales, Lansdale, and Ambler.
""Lines are long but enthusiasm and turnout are high,"" Dean said shortly before polls closed on Tuesday. ""We're all ready to turn Pennsylvania blue.""
8:26 p.m.
""I've done all that I knew to do,"" Barnette said in a Facebook Live video posted shortly after polls closed Tuesday evening. ""I came to you 11 months ago and said that I was going to get to this day having done everything I needed to do, leaving it all out on the field, and that's exactly what we've done.""
The comments came after a lengthy day of campaigning for Barnette, in which she campaigned across the 4th District in Conshohocken, Norristown, Collegeville, Trappe, Boyertown, and elsewhere.
8:21 p.m.
Montgomery County announced that they plan to release preliminary election results at 8:30 p.m. Mail-in ballots were legally allowed to be counted starting at 8 p.m., when polls closed.

MONTGOMERY COUNTY, PA — As the polls closed in Pennsylvania on Election Night Tuesday, results in the race for U.S. Congress in Pennsylvania's 4th District are beginning to trickle in. Incumbent Democrat, Rep. Madeleine Dean, was heavily favored to retain her seat in the strongly blue district despite a compelling campaign from challenging Republican businesswoman Kathy Barnette.
It's possible final results will not be known for days as county elections officials count the historic number of mail-in ballots. In Montgomery County alone, more than 278,00 mail-in ballots were sent out to voters. The counting process for ballots was not legally allowed to begin until polls closed at 8 p.m.
However, it's also possible the results for the 4th District in U.S. Congress, which covers almost all of Montgomery County and leans strongly to the left, will be known with some degree of confidence by the end of the night Tuesday.

Even before the death of Walter Wallace Jr. in Philadelphia in October reignited long simmering tensions over racial injustice, issues like police reform and Black Lives Matter were at the front and center of the ideological disparities in this campaign.
""A mental health crisis should not be a death sentence,"" Dean, 61, said of Wallace's death. ""His life mattered to his mother who was pleading to de-escalate the situation, to Walter's wife who is expecting another child in days, to his children who will now be without their father — and to the community that grieves for him. He should be alive today.""
Dean, who is in the Progressive Caucus in U.S. Congress but has voted in line with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 100 percent of the time in her two years in office, is a strong advocate for police reform. She views the protests and unrest as a sign of systematic injustice.
""As public officials, we have to find the courage to alleviate the frustration and fear that often drives these demonstrations in the first place; we have to rethink and reshape policing in this country so that we can rebuild trust between police officers and the communities they serve,"" she said.
>>In PA's 4th, Kathy Barnette Mounts Challenge To Madeleine Dean
Barnette sees Dean as emblematic of not just the establishment, but of wealthy white leaders and activists who do not understand and therefore cannot represent black communities.
""I succeeded because no one told me I was a victim,"" Barnette said in a recent campaign advertisement. ""We watch as primarily white liberals come into predominately black communities and tell us what our problems are and how to fix them,"" she added in an editorial published by Fox News following the killing of George Floyd.
A native of the Abington area, Dean served as a Pennsylvania state representative in the 153rd district before being elected to her first term in U.S. Congress in the 2018 midterms. She was a part of the ""blue wave"" which saw several first time U.S. Congresswoman elected that year in southeastern Pennsylvania, including Mary Gay Scanlon and Chrissy Houlahan.
Barnette is a businesswoman and longtime conservative political commentator on the national stage, making frequent appearances on Fox News. She grew up in poverty on a pig farm in Alabama, and often cites her background and rise to success through hard work and self-determination as a classic example of the American dream.

For nearly all of Montgomery County outside of a small portion in the north-central, voters reside in the 4th District.

Madeleine Dean, the longtime state representative from Abington.
>>PA 2020 Election Guide: How To Vote, Who's On The Ballot
The local race for state representative in the 153rd district features sitting Democratic State Rep. Ben Sanchez against Republican Marc Bozzacco.
Of course, the race that has sparked the most passion is between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. In Pennsylvania, Democrats were successful in kicking the Green Party off the ballot, meaning left-leaning voters have the option of Biden or a write-in. The only other name to appear on the ballot for president in Pennsylvania is Libertarian Jo Jorgensen. Jorgensen does not have nearly the support in polls that Libertarian Gary Johnson did in 2016. Johnson won 145,000 votes in Pennsylvania four years ago, good for 2.4 percent of the vote, while the Green Party's Jill Stein won about 50,000, or 0.4 percent.
In state races, incumbent Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro is being challenged by Republican Heather Heidelbaugh, a Pittsburgh attorney, Green Party candidate Richard Weiss, and Libertarian Daniel Wassmer. For auditor general, Democrat Nina Ahmad faces Republican Timothy DeFoor, Green Olivia Faison, and Libertarian Jennifer Moore. For state treasurer, Democrat Joe Torsella will face Republican Stacy Garrity, Green Timothy Runkle, and Libertarian Joe Soloski.
