The Coast Guard is looking to shut down a stretch of the Potomac River when the president heads to his golf course in nearby Sterling, Virginia, to unwind, which he does quite often.
The restriction would cover a nearly two-mile stretch of the river where it borders Trump National Golf Club, located at Lowes Island, Virginia, just across from Montgomery County. When Trump is at his club, that section of the river will be totally shut down to kayakers, boaters, jet-skis, and anyone else who doesn't have authorization.
""This action is necessary to prevent waterside threats and incidents immediately before, during and after events held at the Trump National Golf Club at Potomac Falls, VA,"" states the rule document issued by the Coast Guard. ""This rule prohibits vessels and people from entering the security zone and requires vessels and persons in the security zone to depart the security zone, unless specifically exempt under the provisions in this rule or granted specific permission from the Coast Guard Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region or designated representative.
""The regulation will enhance the safety and security of persons and property, while minimizing, to the extent possible, the impact on commerce and legitimate waterway use,"" the Coast Guard adds.
Locals aren't taking the proposal lying down. Nearly 100 comments had already been submitted as of about noon on Wednesday, with most of them being negative.
""It is the president's own fault for creating the open sight lines to his property by cutting down the many trees that used to line the property. At minimum, a transit path for river users should be established on the Maryland side of the river,"" writes Melinda Mathis. ""What would happen if a kayaker or Stand Up Paddleboarder had launched from one side, and while out for their paddle, the restrictions went into place with the full river blocked? How would that river user be able to return to their launch site and vehicle? Being trapped away from a launch site is a safety consideration and a large one at that. Please reconsider this plan of action as it is unfair to those of us who regularly use and enjoy the Potomac River.""
Most commenters so far have objected because veterans groups, boating groups and other regulars have long used the river, viewing the president as a newcomer to the area. Some questioned how much notice would be given, with the possibility that kayakers, who don't have radios, would be caught on the river when a closure goes into effect.
""Please stop the madness. This area has been used by paddlers and boaters for many years,"" writes John Lockwood. ""There's even a public boat ramp on Seneca Creek. Several small businesses that operate in the area offering paddling rentals and lessons will be impacted along with private boaters who enjoy access to the river at both Violettes Lock and Seneca Creek.""
Amy Young said such a security zone would be a ""blow to the soul of the recreational boating community"" in the D.C. area.
""It is outrageous to me that access to a manicured golf course built with little respect for the natural and wild beauty surrounding it, may now trump (pun intended) the access to the river of those who wish to freely recreate on and along the banks of the river,"" she wrote.
You have until Aug. 9 to comment on the proposed security zone at Regulations.gov.

Editor's Note: A story on the Maryland Senate race erroneously said that Rep. Chris Van Hollen's campaign saw a 63 percent decrease in contributions in the third quarter from the $2.6 million raised in the previous quarter. The story should have said that the congressman's third quarter numbers reflect a 32 percent decrease from the $1.4 million raised in the previous quarter. We regret the error.
By DYLAN REFFE, Capital News Service
Rep. Donna Edwards leads fellow Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen in the race for U.S. Senate in Maryland, according to a new Washington Post-University of Maryland Poll released Friday.
Edwards, of Fort Washington, leads Van Hollen, of Kensington, by 10 percentage points – 38 percent to 28 percent - the survey found.This poll is the first to be conducted independently of the campaigns.
""These results certainly counter the perceived advantage that appeared to initially go to Van Hollen as the establishment-supported candidate,"" said Stella Rouse, director of the University of Maryland's Center for American Politics and Citizenship.
An earlier poll, released in August by the Edwards campaign, showed Edwards with a five-point lead over Van Hollen.
""Donna's lead in the polls continues to grow because she's the only progressive fighter in this race willing take on the special interests that stand in the way of progress for Maryland's middle class families,"" said Ben Gerdes, communications director for the Edwards campaign.
The poll also shows that if Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, entered the race, he would have a substantial lead over both Edwards and Van Hollen.
Thirty-three percent of the 550 Democratic voters questioned in the poll said they would vote for Cummings. Edwards and Van Hollen both earned 20 percent of the vote in the hypothetical three-person race.
""It seems that the strength of Baltimore politics is being felt,"" Rouse said. ""It will be interesting to see whether these numbers help persuade Cummings to enter the race.""
Cummings has said that he will not make his decision about entering the race until after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testifies in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, on which he is the ranking member. Another important highlight in the poll is the large number of voters who remain undecided if Cummings does not enter the race: more than 30 percent of the Democratic voters polled haven't settled on Edwards or Van Hollen.
""In the time until the election a great deal can change. But these results are nothing short of fascinating,"" Michael Hanmer, research director for the Maryland center, said in a statement. ""Whether Representative Cummings runs or not, this is going to be an interesting and tightly contested race.""
The Van Hollen campaign does not view the recent poll results as a setback.
""This poll reflects what everyone has always known -- the campaign depends on the battle for the undecided voters in the Baltimore area,"" Van Hollen campaign manager Sheila O'Connell said in a statement.
The Van Hollen campaign aired its first television advertisement last week in the Baltimore media market, a step aimed at helping the congressman's polling numbers.
""The Post poll was conducted before our campaign aired its first television ad in Baltimore. We have growing endorsements in the area, from respected legislators to grassroots activists,"" O'Connell said.
The poll comes on the heels of the end of the financial quarter, which began July 1 and ended September 30.
The Van Hollen campaign raised $950,000 in the third quarter of the year, and now has $4.1 million in the bank.
""As Chris travels to every corner of the state, he is hearing from voters about the issues that matter to them. Their support and generosity is humbling,"" O'Connell said.
Although Van Hollen continues to dominate the financial side of the race, his third quarter numbers include a 63 percent decrease from the $2.6 million raised in the previous quarter.
The Edwards campaign has not made its third quarter numbers public, although the Oct. 15 filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission has just passed. Senate candidates file on paper and the FEC says it can take up to 48 hours to get the information scanned and available to the public on its website."

General Services Director David Dise on Thursday wrote to Rockville city officials asking for permission to move the statue from the Red Brick Courthouse area to the Beall-Dawson Historic Park at 103 West Montgomery Ave. in Rockville, reports Montgomery Community Media.
Last week, the Rockville Historic District Commission approved the county's request to move the statue from its current location. The city owns the Beall-Dawson property.
Confederate memorials have been the target of scorn after a man gunned down nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C. church last month. Dylan Roof posed with a Confederate battle flag in online photos and spoke of his desire for a new race war.
In July, the monument in Rockville was vandalized, with ""Black Lives Matter"" and other graffiti spray painted on the base.

If the city approves the move, Dise said the county would pay for the cost of relocation and perform any work needed for the monument's permanent setting. The monument's long-term upkeep and maintenance would be the responsibility of the city of Rockville.
Dise is asking the city for permission to proceed by Oct. 8 and hopes that if approved, the monument could be relocated by the end of the year."

Tuesday, Sept. 22, through Thursday, Sept. 24.
The English and Spanish videos below offer travel tips, recommend alternate travel options to consider and detail where crowding and delays are expected near Papal events, as Metro plans to provide additional service to accommodate the near Inauguration ridership that is anticipated on Wednesday, Sept. 23 and Thursday, Sept. 24.


Here are specific details on Metrorail and Metrobus service information during the visit:
Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2015
Thursday, Sept. 24, 2015
MARC Train, Bus Service Changes
The Maryland Department of Transportation's Maryland Transit Administration will adjust MARC Train and Commuter Bus service on Wednesday, Sept. 23, and Thursday, Sept.24, to accommodate commuters and visitors during Pope Francis' visit to D.C.
MARC Train
MTA will add capacity to select MARC trains on the Camden and Brunswick lines on Wednesday and Thursday to handle an expected increase in ridership during papal events. The trains, which typically carry between three and four passenger cars each, will include an extra car to accommodate 125 more riders. Also, Brunswick Line train #871 that normally operates only on Fridays will operate on both Wednesday and Thursday. For MARC Train information, click here.

Capital News Service
Pope Francis is visiting the nation's capital during his trip to the United States this week, and visitors, employees and residents alike can expect difficulty and delays getting into and around the city.
The papal events are expected to attract several hundred thousand visitors to Washington over the course of the three-day visit Tuesday through Thursday. The Washington Metro Area Transit Authority says to expect longer wait times, increased trip times, and limited online bus arrival time and schedule predictions due to detours.
The influx of visitors will be similar to that of a presidential inauguration compounded with other popular events in the city, said Sherry Ly, a Metro spokesperson.
""We have rather than, for instance, a [presidential] inauguration and then a parade, and it's done, in this case you have multiple events going on throughout the day, some at the same time … all in the span of two days, and back to back,"" Ly said.
Beth Cobert, acting director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, released a memo Sept. 1 urging federal agencies to allow employees to work from home or take the day off in order to help alleviate traffic concerns and ""minimize distraction to law enforcement and security officials."" In the memo, she recommends that if possible, employees should stay home.
WMATA recommends that customers load SmarTrip cards in advance to avoid kiosk lines. Metro riders can also expect delays and station adjustments because certain stations will be ""exit only."" Riders using Metrobus, WMATA's Washington-area bus service, should also expect delays. Hours and fees for each service will not change for the papal visit.
Metrobus riders on all routes should expect detours on Wednesday and Thursday. There will be delays near the U.S. Capitol in the morning and Gallery Place in the afternoon. Riders should also prepare for crowds and give themselves plenty of extra time to reach their destinations, according to a WMATA advisory.
Maryland Area Regional Commuter trains and Virginia Railway Express will operate on normal schedules during the pope's Washington visit.
Greyhound buses are currently expected to run on their regular schedules between Washington and Philadelphia, as well as Philadelphia and New York, said Lanesha Gipson, Greyhound's senior communication specialist. However, Greyhound is monitoring ticket sales during the pope's visit and will increase service if needed.
Amtrak estimates that a crowd of one million or more will visit Philadelphia during the weekend of Pope Francis' visit, and is requiring riders of all trains to Philadelphia during that time period make reservations.
Extra trains will run on Sept. 26 and 27 between Washington and New York with stops along Pope Francis' travel schedule in Washington, Philadelphia and New York to accommodate the additional crowds, but Amtrak recommends planning for extra travel time."

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley met with marijuana policy experts in Denver Thursday to hear about how legalizing the drug has affected communities in Colorado, but he isn't yet ready to endorse federal legislation legalizing recreational use of pot.
Among the issues the Democratic presidential candidate has touted as he has campaigned around the country is his move while governor to decriminalize marijuana.
But he is being cautious about the next step on the federal level.
""I think we still have to watch, and we have to learn in Colorado and Washington state,"" the ex-governor told reporters after the meeting, according to The Denver Post. ""I'm not there yet, but I am watching very closely what's happening.""
Throughout the 90-minute Denver meeting, lawmakers, administrators, business owners, police officers and veterans detailed positive impacts of the state's legalization experiment.
""Colorado's economy is doing well, it's going up,"" State Rep. Jonathan Singer told O'Malley. ""Teen use has either stayed stagnant or gone down and we're seeing our law enforcement able to focus on crimes that hurt people.""
After listening to several speakers, O'Malley addressed the group, stressing the importance of learning from the states that have legalized marijuana.
""I think as Americans, given the hard truths about drug overdose, violent crime and incarceration, we should have this conversation and be informed by true facts and experiences that people of Colorado are having on the ground here,"" O'Malley said.
The meeting was hosted by Vicente Sederberg LLC, a Denver-based marijuana law firm. Managing partner Brian Vicente said he appreciated O'Malley taking the time to hear from Colorado's leading minds on marijuana policy.
""It showed that he's a thoughtful candidate and he is in touch with the issues that are really hot topics in our country right now,"" Vicente said. ""It speaks volumes that he came to Colorado and sat down with experts to hear about how it's going here and educate his viewpoint.""
Vicente wrote Colorado's constitutional amendment that legalized recreational use of marijuana.
As part of his criminal justice reform proposal, O'Malley has said he will move to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug, alongside Heroin and LSD, to a Schedule II drug. The reclassification is largely a symbolic move, said Vincente, who advocated for full declassification, but it will help make it easier to conduct research on marijuana. On the campaign trail,
O'Malley has highlighted his marijuana policy record in Maryland. He signed a bill in 2014 decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, making Maryland the 18th state to do so. He also made Maryland the 21st state with a medical marijuana program, allowing the state to issue licenses to growers and dispensaries and for patients to possess up to a 30-day supply.
While O'Malley oversaw the loosening of Maryland's cannabis laws, some activists worry about his previous opposition to marijuana reform and his inactive role in his own state's policy changes.
""He presided over [decriminalization and medical marijuana] but he is certainly not viewed as championing that legislation,"" Vincente said. ""He's simply not.""

The Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), a legalization advocacy group who had a spokesperson present at O'Malley's meeting, has graded each 2016 presidential candidate on marijuana policy.
O'Malley received a C-minus, the lowest grade of any declared Democratic candidate.
""He has always been steadfastly an opponent of marijuana policy reform as governor, although it is certainly a welcome development his change in approaches more recently,"" said Dan Riffle, MPP's federal policy director who focused on the Maryland region between 2009 and 2012, during part of O'Malley's time in office.
Riffle said it is not important that candidates support federal legalization, but rather that they respect states' rights to legalize marijuana.
""What I would like to see from O'Malley and other candidates is a pledge to work to change federal law so that not only are we not enforcing federal law in states like Colorado but we're actually changing federal law so that people who are in compliance of state law in Colorado aren't violating federal law,"" Riffle said.
Marijuana business owners at Thursday's listening session said because of federal drug enforcement, banks refuse to deal with marijuana-related companies, forcing the businesses to operate exclusively with cash.
The issue of a state's rights to decide its own marijuana laws came up inWednesday night's Republican debate, with libertarian-leaning Rand Paul arguing against federal government interference.
""I would let Colorado do what the Tenth Amendment says,"" said the Kentucky senator, who received MPP's highest grade of any candidate, with an A-minus. ""This power, we were never intended to have crime dealing at the federal level, crime was supposed to be left to the states. Colorado has made their decision."""

Adjustments to the Purple Line's scope were made after a thorough review to identify ways to reduce project costs. A detailed list of the scope changes can be found at www.purplelinemd.com.
After Gov. Larry Hogan cut state funding to the project this summer, Prince George's County leaders agreed to commit an additional $20 million toward Purple Line construction costs, while Montgomery County leaders have agreed to offer up another $40 for the rail line.
Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III said leaders agreed to increase the county's contribution in exchange for construction of the Purple Line starting in Prince George's County. Also, the state has agreed that the primary command center will be located in the county, he said.
In June, Hogan surprised some supporters by giving the green light for the Purple Line to proceed, but he trimmed the state's share of the cost from nearly $700 million to $168 million, The Washington Post reported."

Last winter, The Washington Post reported the project was four years behind schedule and carried a $141 million pricetag, more than $50 million higher than initial estimates.
Montgomery County and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which will operate the center, filed a lawsuit in August seeking damages for negligence and breach of contract in the center's construction. The center's opening was delayed for years because the initial construction wasn't strong enough to meet safety standards
Montgomery County is asking for a minimum of $80 million in damages from the firms it claims are responsible for mistakes and delays; WMATA is seeking about $25 million for costs. With requests for punitive damages as well as actual damages the total being sought by the governmental agencies tallies at more than $200 million.

The Civil War divided many communities and families in Maryland, according to state historians, and mementos venerating forces for both the South and the North began to appear throughout the state in the early 1900s.
""(Soldiers) returned to Maryland without a great amount of animosity toward one another, and neither side cared if the other put up a monument to honor the dead,"" said Daniel Carroll Toomey, a historian who has served on the state's Military Monuments Commission for more than 20 years. ""You can't deny the fact that the South did go to war, but then they got over it -- we got over it 150 years ago.""
Now, however, communities around the Old Line State are drawing upon old lines and asking officials to reconsider monuments tied to slavery or the Confederacy exactly four months after the racially motivated killings of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Montgomery County has already spent $20,000 boxing up and cleaning a Confederate statue that was vandalized earlier this summer.
And the Montgomery County Council plans to meet Thursday night to decide where to relocate the 102-year-old bronze statue of a Confederate soldier standing next to Rockville's Red Brick Courthouse. The memorial had the words ""Black Lives Matter"" spray-painted on its base, in July.
""We need to find out if we will get approval to relocate the statue"" and then the county will get estimates to pay for moving it, said Greg Ossont, deputy director of the Department of General Services.
SEE ALSO:
In an effort to determine a new, more appropriate location, Montgomery County residents voted earlier this month on a list of five new locations for the statue. The list included: Beall-Dawson Historical Park in Rockville, Darnestown Square Heritage Park in Darnestown, Callithea Farm Special Park in Potomac, Jesup Blair Local Park in Silver Spring and Edgehill Farm in Gaithersburg. Poll results are expected to be discussed on Thursday.
""We share County Executive Isiah Leggett's view that the statue does not belong in the center of government outside the courthouse,"" said County Council President George Leventhal in a news release. ""(We) believe it should be relocated to a site where we are able to tell the full story of Montgomery County's participation in the Civil War from all perspectives.""
Baltimore Evaluates Nine Confederate Monuments
In Baltimore, a special commission also plans to meet Thursday at 9 a.m. to re-evaluate and lead community discussions about the city's nine Confederate monuments, continuing the national conversation about the display of racially controversial memorials, flags and other insignia.
In spite of some objections to the monuments, Toomey said, he believes the monument evaluation committee in Baltimore City is unnecessary.
""The monuments are not just the history of Baltimore City, they are just not the history of Maryland, they're American history,"" Toomey said. ""And no one, no mayor has the right to say what part of American history will be remembered and what will be forgotten.""
According to Howard Libit, a spokesman for Baltimore's mayor, the review will ""ensure that the city stays on the side of respecting history. There is a balance between respecting history and continuing to display items that may be offensive,"" Libit said.
Memorial to Author of Dred Scott Court Ruling
In Frederick, city leaders are deliberating whether to remove the bust of former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney from in front of City Hall. Taney's opinion in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case protected slaveholders' rights and excluded African Americans from citizenship.
Despite the city's efforts to remove the statue, there remain other tributes honoring Taney around the city including Taney Avenue, his grave and his house, which is a historical landmark.
This is where the mess of drawing a distinction begins, Toomey said, like which Confederate-oriented statues should and should not be removed. Though he agrees with the decision to not fly the Confederate flag over government buildings, Toomey said, the monuments should remain in place.
""If anyone was a slaveowner … you would have to take down the Washington Monument, the Jefferson Memorial and blow a path through Mount Rushmore or change the name of the capital,"" Toomey said. ""Where does it stop?""
»Officials boxed up the Confederate statue with plywood outside of Rockville's Red Brick Courthouse after its base was spray-painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" in late July.

10,/maryland/northpotomac/letter-editor-confederate-statue-unfit-stand-public-land,2015-09-10T14:35:51Z,Letter to Editor: Confederate Statue Unfit to...,0,0,Deb Belt,Patch Staff,"Editor's Note: The following is a letter to the Montgomery County Council about the Confederate memorial in Rockville from local resident Marco Simons. He shared a copy with Patch.
As a current resident of Silver Spring and former resident of Rockville, I applaud the efforts of Montgomery County to remove the Confederate memorial from the Rockville courthouse lawn. I echo many of the concerns expressed by Council member Tom Hucker and by the Department of Parks concerning most of the relocation options proposed. I believe that the only sensible option is to transfer the statute into private hands, and only if this can happen without expense to the County.
Reasons for removing the statue, and the historical context of its donation
It is worth reflecting on the reasons for removal of the statue from the courthouse. The primary reason is that it is inappropriate to maintain symbols that honor the Confederacy on public land in Montgomery County. Although the statue may not evoke the visual references of the battle flag or other more well-known symbols of the Confederacy, in many ways its historical symbolism is worse.
The statue honors Montgomery County residents who defied Maryland's refusal to join the Confederacy and crossed over to Virginia to fight against the Union, a deplorable cause at the time. Unlike soldiers from states of the Confederacy, these soldiers' actions cannot be explained by loyalty to their homes and families. Instead it is more likely explained by ideology – loyalty to the cause of slavery that motivated the rebellion, a practice that Maryland shared with the Confederacy. Montgomery County should not honor those who left their homes and their state to voluntarily fight for this cause.
This is compounded by the historical context in which the statue was donated. This was not an immediate postwar recognition of sacrifice – it came nearly 50 years after the end of the Civil War, as part of an effort by neo-confederate organizations (such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the United Confederate Veterans) to burnish the legacy of the Confederate cause and deny that the rebellion was motivated by slavery.
These views are perhaps best exemplified by Mildred Rutherford, who was the historian of the UDC in 1913, when the statue was dedicated. Rutherford's pro-slavery views were apparent, and she expressly tied the monument-building campaign to the rehabilitation of the image of the Confederacy and its cause. Rutherford's 1913 speech to the UDC, ""Thirteen periods of United States history,"" is available on the web (http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009582850); in it she first defends slavery and the secession of the South:
Seward and other Northern politicians . . . arranged to so legislate that no slaves should be in this newly acquired territory. This naturally made the South indignant . . . . The hiding of runaway slaves, and believing their representations of plantation life rather than the representations of the Christian men of the South caused increased resentment. Thirty thousand of our negroes, the property of the planters, had been encouraged to run away and hidden from their owners by means of the so-called ""Underground Railways"" at the North, and sent across the line to Canada.
As in family life, a child is punished if disobedient, so in plantation life a disobedient and unruly negro had to be punished. . . .
A Georgia lawyer, Thos. R. R. Cobb, brought out about this time a book, ""The Law of Slavery,"" which really is a most remarkable production. Every available authority upon the subject of slavery among all nations was carefully studied and quoted. Coming about the time of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" it was suppressed in the North, and the war coming on prevented a second edition in the South. When William Lloyd Garrison heard that this book proved that the institution of slavery was defended by the Bible, he said, ""Better then destroy the Bible,"" showing to what length his fanaticism led him. Fourteen Northern States passed ""Personal Liberty Bills"" and were violating the Fugitive Slave Law which was included in Henry Clay's Omnibus Bill. The South feeling that this Omnibus Bill was unjust to her, accepted it, hoping to bring peace, when these same Northern States, violating the law, urged the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, and he was elected without a single electoral vote from the South, the Southern States felt no right would be respected and it was full time to secede.
And then Rutherford ties the monument-building effort, led by Confederate women, to the rehabilitation of the Confederacy's image:
This was the time when those women of the Confederacy showed of what stuff they were made. . . . They began to collect the bodies of the Confederate soldiers scattered over the battle fields, placing them where they could care for them, and where they could deck those graves with flowers. Then they began to erect monuments over them. . . . Ben Butler, in Louisiana, said we should not build monuments to our Confederate dead, and so said Meade, in Georgia, but we did it anyway, didn't we? They did not know Southern women. More monuments stand to the Confederate soldier today than to any other soldier of any other nation who ever fought for any cause.
Had not Lincoln been assassinated, all would have gone well even then, for the negroes still loved their old owners, and did not wish to leave them. . . .
The Ku Klux Klan was an absolute necessity in the South at this time. . . .
The record of the Confederate soldier, the heroism of the Confederate women, the monuments erected to Southern valor have caused the whole world to be lost in admiration and wonder.
This was the context in which the Rockville statue was erected. It was part of a calculated national effort to rehabilitate the cause of the Confederacy, not the result of local sentiment toward the sacrifice of Montgomery County residents.
The secondary reason for removal, at this point, is that the statue has become a magnet for vandalism. While this should not deter maintaining a monument to a worthy cause, Montgomery County should not subject its public lands to vandalism, nor commit resources to defend against and clean up after vandals, for a cause that never should have been promoted to begin with. In any open-air, public-access location, the statue is likely to draw the same vandalism that recently occurred in Rockville. No park or community should be forced to bear that.
Proposed relocation options
Given these reasons for removal, several of proposed relocation options make little sense. The Parks Department has already recommended against any of the MNCPPC parks proposed, and I agree with their assessment, although for additional reasons. None of these park locations would serve the purpose of removing the statue from a public display which its cause does not deserve, and none of them would eliminate the statue as a target for vandalism in our public spaces.
Councilmember Hucker has commented further on the inappropriateness of placing the statue in Jesup Blair Park, and I agree with his sentiments. It is particularly inappropriate to place the statute in a park which, whatever its historical connections may be, is primarily used by children for its playgrounds and athletic fields. I regularly pass by or run through this park, less than a mile from my house, and placing the statue there would be unacceptable to this community.
But, given its history and symbolism, it should be unacceptable to any community in Montgomery County. Yes, Montgomery County sent soldiers to fight for the Confederacy, and many slaves were held here. This is a history that we should not forget. But neither should we honor those who left their state to defend slavery, or continue to be complicit in the effort to burnish the image of the Confederacy.
The Parks Department recommends Beall-Dawson House as one of two potential options after all MNCPCC parks are ruled out. While I agree that this location might be preferable to the parks, it would be an insult to the legacy of these Rockville families. Although slaveholders, the Beall daughters were no Confederate sympathizers; as the Historical Society itself notes, when General McClellan spent the night at the house, he described the Beall sisters as of ""strong Union sentiment."" The Dawsons likewise ""favored the North,"" according to Peerless Rockville. Placing a monument to their neighbors who left to fight for the Confederacy would dishonor their legacy.
Use of County funds
I strongly agree with Councilmember Hucker's position that no public funds should be used to move the statue. The statue was donated with private money; if private donors are not interested in preserving the statue, so be it. But this is an additional reason that the statue should not be placed in any public location. Even if private funds are secured to move the statue, and to make the necessary improvements identified by the Parks Department for placement in any park, surely some public funds will be needed for upkeep – especially if the statue remains a target for vandalism.
This leaves donating to private custody as the only viable option. If there are those who still wish to honor Marylanders who fought for the Confederacy, let them keep the statue. It was a mistake for Montgomery County to allow its public space to be used for this purpose a century ago, and long past time for us correct that mistake.
Sincerely, Marco Simons"

The federal government is encouraging managers at federal agencies to allow employees to telework during the upcoming visit by Pope Francis.
The Pope will visit the nation's capital Tuesday, Sept. 22, to Thursday, Sept. 24.
Federal officials expect increased traffic, road closures, detours, crowded trains and buses, longer wait times at stops and stations and related commuting disruptions, according to a letter sent out by OPM to federal agencies.
Employees who ""can be spared from their duties"" may also request to adjust their work schedule and use their alternative work schedule day off or take annual leave, leave without pay and/or previously earned comp time off or earned credit hours under a flexible work schedule, OPM noted in the letter.
Those who must commute? OPM advises those employees to take extra time going to and from work whether they're driving or taking public transportation.
OPM is encouraging agencies to communicate with employees using hotlines and Website updates about any agency-specific issues surrounding the visit by the pontiff.
Employees with questions should contact their agency's HR office, OPM advises.

Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III said Friday leaders have agreed to increase the county's contribution by $20 million in exchange for construction of the Purple Line starting in Prince George's County. Also, the state has agreed that the primary command center will be located in the county, he said.
Previously, Prince George's County had committed $100 million toward the project.
The increased county pledges come after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan cut state spending on the proposed 16-mile light rail line extending from Bethesda to New Carrollton. Current estimates to build the line stand at $2.4 billion.
In June, Hogan surprised some supporters by giving the green light for the Purple Line to proceed, but he trimmed the state's share of the cost from nearly $700 million to $168 million, The Washington Post reported.
Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett in July pledged an additional $40 million in county money to the Purple Line, on top of $177 million in previously committed in-kind contributions, reports The Washington Post. The one catch: the state can't ask for the money for five to six years.
When in operation, the Purple Line will provide a direct connection to the Metrorail Red, Green and Orange Lines at Bethesda, Silver Spring, College Park, and New Carrollton. The Purple Line would also connect to MARC, Amtrak, and local bus services. Twenty-one stations are planned.
""County Executive Rushern Baker's announcement today that the County has reached an agreement with the State on funding for the Purple Line is a big deal,"" said Sen. Jim Rosapepe, D-College Park. ""The Purple Line will be transformative for Maryland's Washington suburbs, particularly the older communities in Prince George's and Montgomery County. The University of Maryland at College Park will be a particular beneficiary -- five of the stops will be on or adjacent to the campus."""

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is criticizing the Democratic National Committee's plan to host six primary debates for the 2016 presidential primary, noting the party held 16 debates in 2008 and 13 debates in the 2004 election cycle.
The national committee also issued a threat to candidates who accept any unsanctioned debate invitation or forum, according to news outlets.
Each of the early primary states – Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada – will host a single debate, according to the official schedule. Two other debates will be held in February or March in Florida or Wisconsin.
On Twitter O'Malley said: ""The number of presidential debates should be dictated by voters—not @TheDemocrats in Washington. #WeNeedDebate""
On Wednesday O'Malley also tweeted on the subject: ""@TheDemocrats think they can limit the number of debates we're going to have before the Iowa caucuses…We need to have not just one debate, not just two, but many. Because they will shape the future of the country we give our kids.""
On a conference call, O'Malley for President New Hampshire State Director John Bivona said voters like him in the Granite State are ""swayed by big ideas"" and candidates that actually go out and meet first-in-the-nation primary voters in intimate settings, as has historically been done for generations.
""It's simply wrong,"" he said. ""(The DNC) debate plan should be viewed as a non-starter. It's DC bigfooting at its worse. The DNC should have no role in this process. Candidates should be able to participate without retribution.""
The retribution comments came after The Daily Beast noted in a story earlier this week that Democratic candidates that strayed from the rules would be punished, according to DNC officials.
Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential candidate, said he was ""disappointed, but not surprised,"" by the DNC's six debate limit.
""At a time when many Americans are demoralized about politics and have given up on the political process, I think it's imperative that we have as many debates as possible – certainly more than six,"" he said. ""I look forward to working with the DNC to see if we can significantly expand the proposed debate schedule.""
According to NECN, here are the locations and dates of the six debates:"

Roughly a month after announcing he has non-Hodgkins lymphoma, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan went public with a new development in his fight against cancer: He has lost his hair.
""The First Lady says I'm still sexy,"" Hogan reported on his Facebook page Tuesday, sharing a photo of his new 'do, which he described as ""an aerodynamic look.""
The governor, who is still performing his professional duties, returned to Annapolis last week after completing his second five-day round of chemotherapy at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center.
He says he's fitting in at the state capital, where he posed for a pic outside his office Tuesday to showcase the latest development atop his head.
""It looks like there is another white dome in the Annapolis State House!"" Hogan wrote.

The governor, who is always trying to look for ways to improve efficiency, added: ""I'm saving time not having to wash or comb my hair, and I don't even need to shave my face!""
Upon announcing his cancer diagnosis at a press conference June 22, Hogan described the cancer as ""very advanced stage 3 or stage 4"" and referenced cancerous tumors in various parts of his body, including in his back.
Since then, he has been keeping constituents updated on his health via Facebook, often providing humor and the hashtag #HoganStrong in his posts.

Described as a traffic bottleneck on Interstate 495 between Maryland and Virginia, officials from both states, plus Montgomery County, may discuss a Virginia Department of Transportation study highlighting the need for changes to traffic patterns on the American Legion Bridge.
Fairfax County Board members approved a resolution on Tuesday seeking to find improvements for the bridge, and seeking the aid of Montgomery County, the commonwealth of Virginia and the state of Maryland in making those improvements, according to a report by WTOP.
This resolution comes in the aftermath of the VDOT study that found the American Legion Bridge was the worst traffic of the 11 Potomac River crossings examined. The bridge has the most daily commuters of any of the 11 crossings with 300,000 per day, and a car's average speed crossing the bridge during afternoon rush hour is barely 20 miles an hour (the average speed during non-peak times is often more than 50 miles per hour).
The study recommends extending 495 Express Lanes across the bridge to the I-270 spur, and also suggests adding in a new river crossing in the coming years."

According to Montgomery Community Media, the bill will:
• Authorize the County Executive to set flat rates for certain towing services.
• Require towing companies to have personnel available 24 hours a day at impound lots so vehicle owners can retrieve cars at any time.
• Require one notice sign per 25 spaces in parking lots with 100 or more parking spaces, in addition to requiring signs at entrances.
• Require photographic evidence of violations or of events precipitating the towing of a vehicle.
• Prohibit the use of ""spotters"" to identify vehicles for towing.
• Require towing companies to accept credit cards as well as cash for the redemption of vehicles.
The Council made several amendments to the original bill, including a prohibition of ""patrol towing"" of commercial lots by providing that a towing company ""must not monitor, patrol or otherwise surveil commercial property for the purposes of identifying unauthorized parked vehicles for towing and removal.""
Other features in the bill will: strengthen the Office of Consumer Protection's ability to enforce the law; require written authorization for each tow in the form of an authorization form provided in person, or via fax, email, or other electronic means; make contracts between property owners and towing companies more informative as to respective parties' obligations and liability under the law; and make several changes to more closely aligning the County law with State law.
""Every year there are 30,000 tows from private property in our county. Too many residents have been victims of the unscrupulous business practices of predatory towing,"" said the lead sponsor of Bill 17-15 Council member RogerBerliner. ""Towing is an extraordinary act, and it should only be done for legitimate reasons. The bill we passed today will better protect consumers. Notably, it will ban the use of spotters, who are used to identify and tow away vehicles as quickly as possible and it will give the Office of Consumer Protection the powers it needs to enforce the law and protect consumers. And at the same time, the bill was amended to ensure that our HOAs and condo associations, which have worked very hard to set the right balance in their parking policies, are treated differently from the commercial lots where we see the most worrisome predatory practices. This bill will not only help our residents but our businesses as well, who lose customers as a result of predatory towing.""
The bill also will allow vehicle owners to retrieve personal property from a vehicle that has been towed, but has not yet been released. It sets a maximum $25 fee for ""incomplete tows"" in situations where a vehicle has been hooked up to a tow truck, but the owner then approaches the truck operator and asks for their vehicle to not be towed.
Another provision in the bill requires property owners who wish to engage in non-consensual towing of vehicles for violating their parking policies to first electronically register their commercial lots and provide annual reports on towing activity, unless the director of the Office of Consumer Protection waives the requirement after a finding that Police Department records meet the OCP's needs for enforcement of the law."
