SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA — Federal, state and local Silicon Valley leaders spoke about the pressures nonprofits are facing in a town hall Tuesday, May 19.
Like everyone, nonprofits are hurting during the coronavirus pandemic, but local leaders are trying to find ways keep those organizations alive until the economy starts to rebound.
Nonprofits offer some of the most critical services in communities, often on the front lines of helping homeless, hungry and mentally ill residents. But as enormous city, state and federal deficits loom, Silicon Valley nonprofits are grappling with how they'll stay afloat through the coronavirus pandemic to meet fast-growing need but dwindling budgets.
Nonprofits are often funded in part by grants and contracts with government agencies and programs, meaning they're likely to feel the trickle-down effect of budget deficits.
Silicon Valley's elected leaders, including Santa Clara County Supervisor Dave Cortese, state Assemblyman Ash Kalra and Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, who represents Silicon Valley in the U.S. House of Representatives, joined local nonprofit leaders Tuesday to talk about the challenges nonprofits are facing and what the government will do to help during a virtual town hall.
The event was co-hosted by the California Association of Nonprofits.
""I, and all the elected officials here, have been through deep recessions, earthquakes and every known disaster that California can face, but this is an order of magnitude beyond anything we've ever experienced,"" Cortese said. ""Somehow, we have to get tax revenue back into generation quickly enough to avoid local government running out of money and essentially collapsing the entire safety net system.""
Nonprofits working on thin margins make up a critical cross section of California's economy and core services. The industry generates about 15 percent of the gross state product and provides services governments rely on heavily to keep communities healthy and happy, according to recent data by the California Association of Nonprofits.
But early on in the crisis, nonprofits struggled to get some of the help that the private sector businesses got through the federal CARES Act and relationships with major banks as the pandemic began shutting down the economy. Silicon Valley was among the first regions to feel the impact, as local leaders issued the first shelter-in-place order in the country.
Now that seems to be getting better, said Kyra Kazantzis, chief executive officer for the Silicon Valley Council of Nonprofits, who was on the call Tuesday.
""It was a huge pain in the tuchus to get those loans,"" she said. ""The banks weren't ready, some of the banks didn't do what they were supposed to do, obviously the guidelines were late. But now some of that money is in play, and it's going to save a bunch of nonprofits.""
Even so, the help that is available is not enough to meet the need, she added.
Lofgren agreed. She and other House Democrats are pushing for another coronavirus-related stimulus bill, which would funnel about $1 trillion into states, counties and municipalities and would open more funding accessible to businesses and nonprofits.
The $3 trillion bill, known as the HEROES Act, passed the Democrat-majority House last week but has been characterized as ""a grab-bag"" bill and dead on arrival by leaders in the Republican-led Senate.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hopes the HEROES Act will serve as a starting place for negotiations on a bill that can pass both the House and Senate. But that means it is still unclear what federal relief for states, businesses and individuals hoping for another stimulus check may look like in the future.
""The approach we're taking is that this is obviously an emergency that none of us have experienced in our lifetimes - I mean, no one living in America today has seen anything like this,"" Lofgren said. ""We have to step up to the bat and keep our country from sinking.""
In the meantime, state and local leaders are pushing to support local nonprofits, which employ one in every 14 jobs in California.
Cortese said he'd support an extension of the county's moratorium on evictions for renters affected by the coronavirus and for small businesses. Currently, that moratorium is expected to expire May 31.
He is also advocating for additional funding relief related to mortgages and rent payments at the state and federal levels, and wants the county to continue contracting with nonprofits, though he acknowledged that funds are becoming increasingly scarce.
""If we don't get continued assistance from Washington, especially on the fiscal side, all of us - everybody who's involved in this call - we are going to be in even deeper trouble,"" Cortese said, characterizing the situation as ""a race against time.""
Much of the work that nonprofits do is funded by grants for specific projects, or through events and major fundraisers, many of which have been canceled this year. But cities - particularly San Jose - and local governments have been flexible about rerouting grants to new uses around the pandemic response, Kazantzis said.
At the state level, Kalra has signed letters to Gov. Gavin Newsom to continue to fund and award contracts with nonprofits in the state. He's supported efforts to enact a statewide eviction moratorium on commercial properties that small businesses and nonprofit call home and to approve more funding for food banks and other social safety net programs.
Kalra also co-authored bills aimed at protecting renters and small businesses and nonprofits, though those bills have not yet been approved.
""These letters and legislation we're introducing ... are ways to put pressure on and send signals as we have conversations with the governor to protect our most vulnerable nonprofits and small businesses through this crisis,"" he said. ""And of course, protect our renters, who many of the nonprofits ... support every day, especially through this crisis.""

Shikada has agreed to a 20% pay cut and the city's managers and professional staffers will see their salaries reduced by 15%, Palo Alto Weekly reports.
The ""management and professionals,"" which includes middle managers and other staff, make up the equivalent of 231.75 full-time jobs and their combined pay cuts will save the city $5 million, the report said.
The city faces a $38.8 million budget shortfall, the report said.
The announcement of management accepting salary cuts follows meetings in which council members have had contentious debates over budget cuts, the report said, noting police staffing, library hours and recreational program funding are all on the chopping block, according to the report.
The city's ""manager and professional staff are leading by example,"" Shikada told the council, according to Palo Alto Weekly.

3,/california/losgatos/silicon-valley-bart-extension-service-begin-june-13,2020-05-19T23:08:32Z,Silicon Valley BART Service To Begin June 13,0,1,Bay City News,News Partner,"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA — The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and BART's Berryessa extension to Milpitas and North San Jose will begin passenger service June 13, the two agencies announced Tuesday.
Officials from both agencies as well as Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo held a signing ceremony for the extension's Project Safety and Security Certificate, signifying the completion and verification of the project's safety tests and allowing passenger service at the two new transit stations to proceed.
While BART ridership remains around 90 percent below the agency's expected baseline figures due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the group of BART, VTA and government officials were all smiles in announcing the eight-year project's completion.
""We know these have been some dark months that we've endured,"" Liccardo said. ""But pulling together, this valley, this county, this region, this city have all shown our character, collectively, and we should celebrate great days like this.""
The 10-mile, $2.3 billion Berryessa project extends BART service from the Warm Springs District in Fremont through Milpitas to the Berryessa area of North San Jose.
The completion of the extension also marks BART's first foray into Santa Clara County and gives the transit agency a total of 50 stations and roughly 130 miles of track. Both BART stations will include direct VTA bus connection service, drop-off and pick-up areas for pedestrians and shuttles, bicycle storage and public areas to allow people to meet with each other near each station.
The Milpitas station will also include a direct connection to VTA's Milpitas light-rail station.
""Expanding travel options in one of the Bay Area's most congested corridors is key to an economic revival,"" BART General Manager Bob Powers said.
""Connecting Silicon Valley to the rest of the Bay Area will not only beef up our public transportation network but create new opportunities for much-needed housing near transit.""
The first train serving the two new stations is expected to depart the Berryessa station along the Richmond line at 7:56 a.m. The train will arrive at Milpitas about three minutes later, according to BART and VTA officials. The Berryessa project is the first phase of BART and VTA's effort to extend BART service into San Jose and Santa Clara.
The second phase, totaling about 6 miles, is expected to include the construction of subterranean stations at 28th Street in San Jose's Little Portugal, in downtown San Jose near the intersection of Santa Clara and Market streets, the San Jose Diridon rail depot and a ground-level station just north of Avaya Stadium in Santa Clara.
The $5.6 billion second phase is expected to break ground in 2022, with an estimated completion date around 2030. VTA officials changed both of those estimates last year, increasing the price tag by nearly $1 billion and pushing the opening back roughly four years.

4,/california/losgatos/how-silicon-valley-candidates-campaign-while-social-distancing,2020-05-11T18:14:40Z,How Candidates Campaign While Social Distancing,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"By Loan-Anh Pham/San Jose Spotlight
SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA — Door-knocking, shaking hands and kissing babies is off the table for Silicon Valley political candidates during the coronavirus crisis.
And with stay-at-home orders extending through May, candidates are now devising new strategies to reach voters in a digital campaigning landscape as the November election draws near.
A side effect of shelter-in-place, according to San Jose City Council candidate David Cohen, is the cancellation of events where politicians would normally go to mingle and interact with the community.
""To have events cancelled, like our Berryessa Art and Wine festival that was supposed to happen the first weekend of May, and to not have that opportunity to interact with the community and see everybody ... is hard,"" said Cohen, who is running for the city's District 4 council seat.
With the California primaries in March, there's a ""natural low"" in campaigning, Cohen said.
""We don't know what the landscape's going to look like in September and October, which is really where the bulk of the campaign happens, so we have to be prepared for everything,"" Cohen continued. ""At this point, it is hard to know how to continue to widen your circle and meet more people.""
District 4 Councilmember Lan Diep could not be reached for comment.
Councilmember Dev Davis who is fending off challenger Jake Tonkelin November said her campaign is in the process of planning for the ""new digital age."" But being a councilmember, Davis said, comes before being a candidate.
""I'm much more focused on making sure my residents are safe and healthy and understanding orders that the county has put in place,"" Davis said.
""The whole world turned upside down and we're figuring it out.""
Like several of her colleagues on the San Jose City Council, Davis has hosted online office hours, including a discussion with SJPD Chief Eddie Garcia about public safety last month.
Tonkel is doubling down on social media, such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Nextdoor, to reach voters - a cornerstone of his campaign strategy even before the contagious virus shut down Silicon Valley.
Tonkel's campaign has been hosting digital town hall meetings to reach the community.
""One of the fortunate pieces about being in the digital generation is we're able to connect,"" Tonkel said. ""We understand you have to build trust and relationships and build community over all types of avenues, and this is no different.""
Non-digital strategies
Not everyone is campaigning to fit the era of Zoom meetings.
California Senate Candidate Ann Ravel instead is keeping in touch with voters and supporters via handwritten thank-you cards.
So far, Ravel said, she's penned 300 personalized cards.
""I felt like I had to write to people who were my volunteers, who were my supporters,"" Ravel said. ""I know that when you get a personal 'thankyou' note from someone that you don't expect, it's very meaningful. I think it's much more personal, rather than having your campaign send out some card statement that is exactly the same thing for everybody.""
For Santa Clara County Supervisor Dave Cortese, who is running against Ravel for the District 15 Senate seat, his current job involves plenty of personal interaction - as does his campaign.
""What would ordinarily be a 65-hour week on the Board of Supervisors is now... around the clock, seven days a week,"" he said.
And while his campaign efforts are still moving along with mailers, emails and endorsement announcements, Cortese said his priority is the job he was elected to do.
""What's the point of being in office, if you're not going to help people during a crisis, during a pandemic, during the health emergency?"" Cortese said.
""I've been in office representing people during some pretty significant times, but this is by far, by order of magnitude, the most significant.""
Fundraising
The sudden economic downturn in the past two months also begs the question of whether fundraising in election campaigns will be as robust as before. Fundraising numbers from the latter half of 2019 reached staggering totals among San Jose City Council candidates.
Bob Brunton, California Assembly candidate, makes sure to ask potential supporters whether they're healthy and doing well financially.
""It seems there's huge differences in how this pandemic is affecting people,"" Brunton, who's running for District 25's State Assembly seat, said.
Alex Lee, Brunton's opponent, predicted that fundraising numbers would decrease for his campaign, which does not take money from corporate donors.
""We relied very heavily on individual small-dollar donors,"" Lee told San Jose Spotlight.
""As the impact of the recession might be hurting a lot of families, it might be something that impacts our fundraising efforts a lot - but we're still going to try.""
What the future holds
Despite uncertainty surrounding the November elections, lawmakers expressed relief that Santa Clara County voters don't need to head to the polls physically. Santa Clara County this year rolled out all-mail elections to comply with California's Voter's Choice Act.
""I'm glad we went to mail-in ballots prior to any of this happening,"" Davis told San Jose Spotlight. ""I feel like our county has been, at least elections-wise, prepared.""

Contact tracing and case investigation is ""core to public health efforts to control the spread of a communicable disease,"" Dr. Sara Cody told the board during the meeting. ""And we're going to need to do it at a scale that we've never before done here or in many, many other places.""
The goal is to be able to have county staff investigate every new case of COVID-19, but the county currently traces about 75 cases per day, according to Cody. She said an ideal team of contact tracing staff would be about 1,000 people.
Dr. Jennifer Tong, branch director for the health care surge team at the emergency operations center, said the county's personal protective equipment stock is ""sufficient"" for local healthcare providers to handle current patient volumes, but as hospitals and health care workers move towards resuming regular operations such as elective surgeries, PPE use will go up.
""There is an ongoing supply chain interruption,"" Tong added, but the county gathered roughly 16 million pieces of PPE, despite the nationwide shortfall in supplies. ""But we still continue to have shortages, predominantly in regular-sized N95 respirators and gowns.""
She also said the county's hospitals have been directed to keep a 30-day stock of PPE and notify the county if they have adequate supplies or not.
County officials on Monday announced two new testing sites - one at James Lick High School in San Jose and the other at Christopher High School in Gilroy - available by appointment only.
""I don't yet understand how we're ever going to be able to test enough, or how we'll have enough tests in California, to open up, even slowly,"" board president Cindy Chavez said during Tuesday's coronavirus discussions.
Cody noted that ""we've been very successful with driving down the spread of infection. And we know there are places where we have more intense infection,"" so the county's next move forward is to target isolation of such high intensity areas, such as skilled nursing facilities, and trace those sites' spread to better understand where and when other parts of the county can begin opening back up.

The COVID-19 Assistance Navigation hotline, or ""CAN,"" is a free resource from the Fair Workplace Collaborative and connects residents to lawyers, information about unemployment applications, housing, food banks, and financial aid during the crisis.
The county has been under a shelter-in-place order since March 16, and local leaders have extended the closure of all non-essential businesses until May 3.
An eviction moratorium is in place to protect residents who are unable to pay rent, but many have exhausted their bank accounts to pay off remaining expenses from April, San Jose City Councilwoman Maya Esparza said Thursday.
With no income or reduced hours, many are nearing desperate financial situations. Supervisor Dave Cortese said the hotline is designed to support people in ""oppressive"" and ""untenable"" employment situations.
He gave the example of a young woman who did not receive a paycheck because her employer was only paying senior employees and laying off workers until the crisis passed.
""These are exactly the kind of calls that we want to receive through this hotline, and people should rest assured that they can make that call without fear of repercussion or retaliation,"" Cortese said in a virtual news conference Thursday.
The Fair Workplace Collaborative is partnering with the Legal Advice Hotline to provide individualized advice.
Lawyer Ruth Silver Taube said the hotline has received calls about essential workers being denied personal protective equipment and employers threatening to call U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement if an employee skips work.
The legal aid hotline also handles daily requests about navigating online systems to request resources and services.
""We are here for you, Santa Clara County CAN is here to connect you to the resources you and your family may need."" said Jessica Vollmer, director of the Fair Workplace Collaborative through Working Partnerships USA.
Residents can reach the CAN hotline at (408) 809-2124. Services are currently available in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese with more languages being added.

Supes Mull Testing, Life After Lockdown",0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA — The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors made clear that they don't know what the future will look like after the county's shelter-in-place order, but teased the idea during their briefing with the county's public health officer Tuesday.
""There's a lot of uncertainty,"" Dr. Sara Cody, the county's public health officer, told the board Tuesday morning. ""We have to get comfortable with uncertainty. And we are in this for the long haul.""
As county residents stay indoors to curb the spread of COVID-19, public health officials expect case numbers to continue to rise and are working hard to lower whatever the future death count may be.
Cody said that while she and the rest of the county's public health experts wonder what to do after the shelter order is lifted, there are a number of checkpoints the county must reach before then.
""I think the next phase is going to be even harder,"" Cody said.
""I think the decisions are going to be even harder.""
She said the county's hospitals must be ready and able to treat every patient that needs care, and the county must be able to test broadly and widely.
While the county's hospitals are currently functioning under capacity, there is no way to open the county's testing capacity publicly.
She added that this is the case throughout the entire country, which has a health care system dependent on the help of the private sector.
By Monday, the county had conducted 11,782 tests for COVID-19 - including 1,285 positive and 1,243 negative confirmations. About 250 tests have not been officially counted yet.
Furthermore, the county can only process results of a test in about 2.27 days, which is ""significantly less"" time than it was earlier last month or last week, according to Dr. Karen Smith, the former California Department of Public Health director and a speaker during the board's Tuesday meeting.
Additionally, the county's public health lab has run just 237 tests compared to Stanford's labs' 4,010 tests.
And Verily, a Google-backed company, has seen 2,558 test subjects, though their tests are run and confirmed through other commercial private labs which report their data independent of the county's official count.
""The good news is there's more testing (and) the time to getting results is much shorter than it was before, but clearly there is a significant need for additional testing,"" the former state public health director said, who added that there is a shortage in testing materials - particularly the swabs clinicians use to gather specimens to test - that further limits testing capabilities in the county, the country and the rest of the world.
She also added that the county needs to be able to test any and all workers at the county's health care facilities in order to be able to move forward into post-shelter life, but the county does not presently have that capability.
The board asked for clarifications and timelines on when these new testing measures can happen, but the health officials were not able to offer specific or definitive dates.
The public is simply waiting for a vaccine and waiting for a peak in confirmed cases to signify a turning point. Until then, the county has continued plans to shelter in place to save as many lives as possible.
""People are going to die no matter what, it's just a matter of what risk we're willing to take,"" the county's executive, Dr. Jeff Smith, said to the board.
""This is not going to be an easy thing to do."" Board president Cindy Chavez noted her concern for departments that have seen high volumes of employees in isolation, noting that some departments have seen between 12 and 50 employees.
She said she wants to know what can be done to make sure certain departments with a finite number of essential workers can be tested to ensure their department can continue to function in the coming months.
""The testing capacity is not there to test everybody that needs to get tested,"" Cody told the board.
Jeff Smith added that the county does not ""have the authority to tell them what to do, how much they can do or whether they do it or not.""
Supervisor Joe Simitian asked Cody to explain what testing for antibodies can do to help locally, to which she replied that it could help health care workers know if they had been infected and had some form of immunity to COVID-19, but that she would need further information to make any official decision on the capabilities of such testing.
Supervisor Mike Wasserman asked if anyone can test positive for the virus, get over the disease and then test positive again, and Supervisor Dave Cortese asked for a new dashboard to display results of homeless individuals who have tested positive for the virus.
Cody said there will certainly be reintroduction of the disease into the public for any number of reasons.
Ky Le, the county's office of supportive housing director, did not offer a new dashboard for the county but did update the board by saying ""at this point we're not aware of any COVID-positive persons who need non-congregate sheltering"" apart from the 17 people identified since last week that have been sheltered and isolated due to possible exposure.
Also, Supervisor Susan Ellenberg asked that the board consider expanded and widely accessible child care services no later than the first week of August. By Monday, Santa Clara County had 1,285 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 43 deaths.

10,/california/losgatos/sc-co-sj-leaders-address-eviction-ban-misinformation,2020-04-03T03:27:11Z,"SC Co., SJ Eviction Ban Misinformation Addressed",0,1,Bay City News,News Partner,"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA — Santa Clara County and San Jose leaders on Thursday addressed misinformation surrounding the new countywide eviction moratorium, emphasizing that residents have to communicate with landlords and that late fees and interest are prohibited during the novel coronavirus response.
The moratorium is not a rent freeze, but rather allows tenants 120 days of deferred payment on their rent if
This can include indirect impacts, such as family members who need financial support due to the virus, or reduced work hours from staying at home to take care of children.
Residents have to provide documentation of the hardship. County supervisors approved the ordinance at their weekly meeting on March 23, following a citywide ordinance by the San Jose City Council earlier last month.
The eviction freeze lasts until May 31, at which point the 120-day period begins, and could be extended based on new developments with COVID-19.
The ordinance also applies to small business owners who have suffered losses or had to close.
""We want to make sure no tenant is under the false belief that 'Oh great, I just don't have to pay at all.'"" Supervisor Dave Cortese said during a virtual news conference Thursday. ""You have to pay at some point, you still owe the rent, but you can't be evicted while you're struggling or unable to pay at this point in time.""
Christopher Rios, a Milpitas resident of four years who has lost income due to COVID-19, said tenants are already making difficult decisions about what medications they can afford to continue, what meals they can skip, and which utility bills are essential.
""I'm definitely nowhere near the poverty line, so to tell you that we're struggling right now -- it should be a sign. It should be a signal for you to understand that your constituents are ultimately suffering,"" Rios said.
""I'm here to tell you that this is not the middle of it, this is really just the beginning, we're not even at the halfway point. We don't really know how long a quarantine could go into effect for, we don't know how long we could be out of work for,"" he said.
He added that civil lawsuits from landlords could flood the courts after the moratorium ends if local leaders are unable to create lasting support for income and job loss throughout the county.
As local leaders try to push out information about the eviction moratorium, they've also encountered reports about landlords taking advantage of uninformed tenants by forcing contracts with added interest.
City Councilwoman Magdalena Carrasco stressed Thursday that the ordinance prevents landlords from upcharging tenants in any way for not making rent payments on time.
Tenants will eventually have to pay rent, and the moratorium is a temporary reprieve for many who have lost jobs, been forced to work fewer hours, or taken on extra responsibilities with lower pay due to the pandemic.
City and county leaders are trying to determine what steps will secure housing for renters in the coming weeks. For now, Carrasco said tenants should try to pay full or partial rent if they're able to afford it, without fearing any retaliation.
""This is still going to be a difficult situation, every jurisdiction is trying to figure out ways on how we're going to support families,"" Carrasco said. ""The most important thing today is shelter in place, stay safe, stay healthy.""
She said, ""This [moratorium] allows you not to go out and continue working under risky conditions, not to go looking for a job under risky conditions ... but rather have some relief and know that you are not to be penalized turning in your rent late.""
Tenants can find legal support through the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley by calling (408) 280-2424, the San Jose renter help line at (408) 975-4480, or the county disaster hotline at 211.

The Silicon Valley Strong program includes an online resource hub at siliconvalleystrong.org that will serve as a location at which volunteers can sign up to distribute food to vulnerable populations like seniors and those with significant medical issues. ""We've been seeing, in action, the Mr. Rogers quote 'look for the helper

The program will also accept donations to the new San Jose Strong that will be used to support low-income residents and small businesses in San Jose that are being affected most by the coronavirus outbreak and the Bay Area's shelter-in-place order.
The city of San Jose and Santa Clara County are operating the program and the San Jose Strong fund in collaboration with Silicon Valley businesses like Apple, according to Liccardo's office.
""We understand the next few weeks will bring challenges for the many small businesses that make our community one of the most special in the country,"" said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives.

Cortese made the proposal on the same day that seven Bay Area jurisdictions ordered a regional shelter in place to tamp down the coronavirus spread and give local medical workers a fighting chance to care for residents without overwhelming health care facilities.
""This rapidly evolving situation requires that we put community first to ensure the delivery of vital supplies such as food, the preservation of housing for those who have suddenly lost their sources of income, and psychosocial support to families and individuals as we face a period (of) unprecedented economic and emotional stress in our lives,"" Cortese said in a statement Monday.
Once the regional shelter in place order goes into effect after midnight Tuesday, businesses around the Bay Area will close and workers will lose hours -- save for essential services and businesses such as first-responders, gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals. In the South Bay, the City of San Jose -- Santa Clara County's seat and largest city -- shifted into Stage 5 of its five-stage emergency plan to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.
The shift shuttered non-essential services such as the Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services Department and transferred workers into food distribution systems that will begin bringing food to elders and children under the age of 18.
Homeless residents are exempt from the order and are encouraged to shelter in place. The county said Monday that it will be working on a system to provide shelter and isolation to homeless individuals who are ill or need care, but official plans have yet to be released.
The emergency funding proposal will be heard by the board at its March 24 meeting.

The board voted unanimously to direct county administrators to take the actions required to swiftly allocate the funding.
As part of the vote, the supervisors also called on the city of San Jose to make a similar donation to the program. Supervisor Mike Wasserman noted that he singled out San Jose to make a similar donation because it comprises about half of the county's population and is the only city in the county to receive more than $100 million in federal funding support from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.
The relief program disperses funding to residents throughout the county who are facing critical issues like homelessness and food insecurity during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
The county contributed $2 million to the program's first phase, spurring another $10 million in funding from public and private sources.
More than 4,500 families signed up for support in the program's first three days but some 13,000 families throughout the county are still in need of support, according to county officials.
The county's $5 million allocation for the program's second phase will support the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which runs the program, in its effort to send between $500 and $1,000 to county residents.
Low-income residents who did not qualify for a federal stimulus check will be prioritized, according to the county.
Supervisor Susan Ellenberg said that while she was supportive of the allocation, the looming question of the county's immediate budgetary strength gave her pause.
""I want us to meet the basic needs of residents whose suffering has increased as a result of COVID-19,"" Ellenberg said. ""And what makes me nervous ... is not knowing what amount of money we have to allocate.""
County officials have projected a shortfall of up to $300 million for fiscal year 2020-2021 due to the pandemic. Fiscal year 2020-21 is set to begin July 1.

The reform package requires county law enforcement officials and agencies like the sheriff's office to comply with various new policies such as requiring officers to stop those who use excessive force, banning the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints and requiring officers to exhaust all other de-escalation tactics before using deadly force.
The law enforcement reform package requires county law enforcement officials and agencies like the sheriff's office to comply with various new policies such as requiring officers to stop those who use excessive force, banning the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints and requiring officers to exhaust all other de-escalation tactics before using deadly force.
Supervisor Joe Simitian proposed the reform package in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis.
Simitian said he developed the reforms in accordance with those outlined by the group Campaign Zero's ""8 Can't Wait"" proposed policy changes to prevent killings by law enforcement.
""Our board is probably not going to be able to solve the challenges of institutional racism in a week or a month or a year or longer,"" Simitian said.
""But what we can do, what we should do, what we have the opportunity to do and what I would argue we have the obligation to do is to step up and do something that is real and tangible and that will save lives,"" he said.
The board also voted to require the county counsel, Office of Correction and Law Enforcement Monitoring, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, the district attorney's office and the public defender's office to report on several additional policy reforms.
The group of county offices must report on the possibility of ending the hiring of law enforcement officials with a history of misconduct complaints, making a public list of all lethal and non-lethal weapons owned by the county, limiting the acquisition of military weapons and equipment, limiting the use of tear gas and rubber bullets for crowd control and restructuring the county's emergency response policies to ensure the county employees who are best trained for a situation are able to handle it.
The group of county offices will give their report to the board Aug. 11.
Sheriff Laurie Smith said her office was in favor of the reforms, some of which county law enforcement has already enacted.
""(These reforms) will allow us to build trust with the community that I think law enforcement in general, really, has lost,"" Smith said.
Supervisor Cindy Chavez said she will closely monitor the potential effect of changing which county employees respond to various cases such as homelessness calls and mental health issues that would normally be handled by law enforcement.
""That's significant and, I think, very powerful and probably the area I'm going to keep my eye most on,"" Chavez said.

People entering the courthouse will be required to wear a face covering in all public areas and should avoid making any unnecessary physical contact. People in the courthouse should also maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other and follow markings placed on the floor to properly practice physical distancing.
""As jurors are summoned back to Court and trials resume, the Court has implemented the highest levels of safety precautions and social distancing protocols in an effort to keep our community safe and healthy,"" Presiding Judge Deborah Ryan said.
Fewer jurors will be required to report to court each day and potential jurors will be called into the courthouse in smaller groups to allow for proper physical distancing.

Rosen had supported the death penalty in the past, especially when he viewed the murders through the eyes of the victims, he said.
""But, I also trusted that as a society we could ensure the fundamental fairness of the legal process for all people. With every exoneration, with every story of racial injustice, it becomes clearer to me that this is not the world we live in,"" Rosen said a news release.
""And shamefully our society's most drastic and devastating law enforcement punishment has been used disproportionately against defendants of color.""
A report by the district attorney's office on race and prosecutions found the largest disparities for Black/African American defendants, who make up 3 percent of the county's population, were in robbery cases (23 percent of all charged cases), resisting arrest at 16 percent, residential burglary at 13 percent and second-degree burglary at 24 percent.
For Latinx defendants, who make up 26 percent of the county population, the largest disproportionality was for felony DUIs at 72 percent, murder/attempted murder at 58 percent, residential burglary at 58 percent and corporal injury on a spouse at 56 percent.
Rosen said the reasoning behind eliminating the death penalty is that it often takes a long time for someone on death row to be executed, using a significant amount of public funds without finality to the victim's families.
Gov. Gavin Newsom last year also signed an executive order that effectively ends the death penalty in the state, at least for the duration of his time in office.
Only 13 people in California have been executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977, though 140 people on death row have died from other causes as of Tuesday, according to the California Department of Corrections and rehabilitation.
California's death row is the largest in the country with more than 700 condemned prisoners, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
In the wake of the killing of unarmed Black man George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May, Rosen met with local community leaders and neighborhood activists, criminal justice reform advocates, elected officials, and prosecutors within his office to create a set of reforms.
The first set of reforms include: working to end cash bail in California, stopping requesting fines and fees from indigent defendants, and creating a fund with illegal money seized from criminals to be awarded to different organizations addressing race and inequity in the community.
The district attorney's office will also immediately expunge the criminal record of those who are eligible and have completed probation, and transfer Driving on a Suspended License for Failure to Pay Fines and Fees in Superior Court to be filed in Traffic Court as infractions.
A Public and Law Enforcement Integrity Team will also be created by the district attorney's office to investigate criminal misconduct of police, including the excessive use of force.
The San Jose Police Officers Association disagreed with Rosen's reforms, saying it will ""increase the use of force and attacks on officers.""
SJPOA President Paul Kelly said by creating the Public and Law Enforcement Integrity Team, Rosen is insulting every police chief's integrity.
""Local police chiefs and the Sheriff have not been shy about disciplining officers and referring criminal cases to the district attorney when warranted,"" Kelly said. ""The hubris displayed by Mr. Rosen and disrespect to other law enforcement leaders is galling.""
Rosen calls the initiative ""Bend the Arc,"" inspired by MartinLuther King Jr's 1965 Speech where he said, ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.""
""It gives us a powerful reminder that we can't just sit back and wait and hope that justice happens. It won't,"" Rosen said. ""We have to actively, purposely, and intentionally seek justice and pursue justice to achieve justice.""

25,/california/losgatos/eviction-time-bomb-looms-silicon-valley-renters-report,2020-07-23T17:57:36Z,‘Eviction Time Bomb’ Looms For Santa Clara...,0,0,Gideon Rubin,Patch Staff,"SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CA – An ""eviction time bomb"" is looming for upwards of 43,000 Santa Clara residents and many others throughout the Bay Area, KQED reports.
The county's undocumented population and low-income workers are at greatest risk of eviction amid the devastating economic impact of the coronavirus crisis according to the report.
People of color, households headed by women and families of young children are among the most vulnerable according to KQED, which cites a report released Wednesday by the nonprofit Law Foundation of Silicon Valley (LFSV).
The LFSV report was released ahead a county eviction moratorium for those who can't afford rent due to the pandemic's economic impact that expires Aug. 31.
""We're looking at an eviction time bomb,"" LFSV attorney Michael Trujillo told KQED.
""There's a huge risk of a surge in homelessness, which could be over a 200% increase.""
The expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of this month figures to exacerbate this crisis.
And if reports from around the country are any indication, landlords don't appear to shying away from the opportunity to evict tenants for nonpayment of rent amid the pandemic, with some filing notices before they're legally permitted to do so, The New York Times reports.
The Cares Act shields tenants who receive federal assistance from eviction through July 24 amid the COVID-19 crisis.
The fallout of an ""eviction time bomb"" could have devastating implications from an epidemiological standpoint according to a Reuters report.
COVID-19 cases have spiked 150 percent in Milwaukee since its eviction moratorium expired May 26, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health infectious disease expert Dr. Nasia Safdar told Reuters.
Although it's impossible to specifically correlate the coronavirus case spike with the eviction moratorium's expiration, Safdar told Reuters the prospect of displacing people from their homes amid a pandemic is dangerous.
""A key tenet of prevention in a pandemic is to have the infrastructure that will minimize transmission from person to person,"" Safdar said.
""Any activity that breaks down that structure ... makes containment of a pandemic exceedingly difficult.""
And the Bay Area's ""time bomb"" figures to hit the nation on an exponentially larger scale.
Up to 28 million people could face eviction in the upcoming months as a result of the Care Act protections expiring, Princeton University's Eviction Lab national research co-creator Emily Benfer told Reuters.
That figure far exceeds the 10 million people who were displaced amid the 2008 financial crisis.
In Santa Clara County, tenants will have up to six months to pay half of their past due rent when the moratorium expires next month. They'll have a year to get fully caught up.
Nearly half of Latinx renters (46 percent) and a majority of Black renters said they had little to no confidence they'd be able to pay their rent in July according to a survey conducted by U.S. Census Bureau last month.
Low-income residents throughout the Bay Area are at risk according to the report, which notes that approximately 12,000 Contra Costa County households, including an estimated 10,400 children, could be displaced when the county's eviction moratorium runs out.

The San Jose Police Department will seek assistance from the FBI in an investigation into the officers' alleged comments on the ""10-70DSJ"" Facebook group, the department said Saturday.
""I have previously responded with discipline up to termination after an investigation into off duty online activity that runs counter to our standards of conduct,"" Police Chief Eddie Garcia said. ""While I have no control over what former employees post online, I can voice my outrage after hearing about these comments made online.""
Garcia joined San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo in condemning posts on the Facebook group that were aimed at Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement.
The officers' alleged comments were revealed by a Medium post published Friday titled ""Racism and Hate behind the Blue Wall: Exposing Secret Law Enforcement Facebook Groups.""
The author, described only as the partner of an active San Jose officer, said they were driven to speak out after a recent blog post by racial justice activist Shaun King describing a plot by former law enforcement members to kill him.
The Medium article listed examples of alleged bigoted and racist posts by San Jose officers. Some included threatening comments about Muslim women with one officer posting ""I say re-purpose the hijabs into nooses.""
The same officer posted an image of a 'Sharia Barbie,' depicting a doll with a black eye that ""comes with a hijab, bruises, a Quran, and stoning accessories,"" according to the Medium article.
In the Facebook group, one retired officer describes Black Lives Matter activists as ""racist idiots,"" ""un-American"" and "" 'enemies' that the police 'swore an oath against',"" the Medium article states.
Another current officer commented that ""Black lives don't really matter.""
San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo called for an investigation and said any officer who posted racist comments would be fired.
""I demand and expect a full investigation, and further expect that racist, anti-Muslim or menacing comments expressed by any current SJPD Officer will be met with termination,"" Liccardo said Friday.
The San Jose Police Officer Association president Paul Kelly denounced the posts and said the union wouldn't shelter the officers.
""I am announcing tonight that I am taking swift action against any member of the SJPOA that has participated in this online ring of hate because there is zero room in our department or our profession for racists, bigots or those that enable them,"" Kelly said in a video post.

27,/california/losgatos/judge-rules-census-must-not-be-rushed,2020-09-25T17:43:17Z,Judge Rules That Census Must Not Be Rushed,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"SAN JOSE, CA — A U.S. District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction Thursday evening that blocks the U.S. Census Bureau from the ability to shorten two key time frames in the preparation of the 2020 census.
U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh barred the defendants — the U.S. Department of Commerce and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the Census Bureau and Director Steven Dillingham - from shortening the deadlines for gathering and processing data and for reporting the tabulation of the total population to President Donald Trump.
The plaintiffs — a group including the National Urban League and the cities of San Jose, Los Angeles and Salinas — sued the defendants based on a decision by Ross and Dillingham to accelerate deadlines in an operational plan implemented after the pandemic made the original plan unworkable.
The court found that the effect of the change was to reduce ""the time for the 2020 Census from 71.5 weeks to 49.5 weeks."" The preliminary injunction entered by the court will restore the
earlier deadlines.
In her 78-page opinion, Judge Koh found that Defendants chose ""speed over accuracy"" and that ""the result of this significant compression in these extraordinary times will be inaccuracies in the tabulation of total population.""
The accuracy of the census is significant because the results are used to determine congressional representation and are also used in apportioning federal funds distributed to the states. According to the plaintiffs, ""undercounted cities, counties, and municipalities will lose representation in Congress and tens of millions of dollars in funding.
And, communities of color will lose core political power and vital services."" The suit challenged changes made in the operational plan that guided the bureau's data gathering and processing for the decennial census.
The initial plan was up-ended by the pandemic, and in April, revisions to the plan reset and extended a number of the deadlines in the initial plan.
However, on Aug. 3, Ross and Dillingham abruptly changed course and shortened the deadlines in the revised plan. According to the plaintiffs, the staff at the Census Bureau believed that the shortened deadlines would prevent a complete and accurate count.
One of the internal documents quoted by the court was an email between Census Bureau employees, which stated ""we need to sound the alarm to realities on the ground...it is ludicrous to think we can complete 100 percent of the nation's data collection [by the revised deadline] and any
thinking person who would believe we can deliver apportionment [by the revised deadline] has either a mental deficiency or a political motivation.""
In a statement issued after the court's opinion, plaintiffs' counsel Melissa Arbus Sherry stated, ""a full, fair, and accurate count takes time, especially when faced with a historic pandemic. Every day that the 2020 Census count continues, and Census operations appropriately continue, will help ensure the accuracy and completeness of this once-in-a-decade tally.""

30,/california/losgatos/caltrain-sales-tax-measure-be-november-ballot,2020-08-08T16:25:54Z,Caltrain Sales Tax Measure To Be On November...,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"CALIFORNIA — San Francisco's Board of Supervisors unanimously approved an eighth-cent sales tax measure for the November to fund Caltrain during a special meeting Friday -- the last day to place the measure on the county ballots.
If ultimately approved by two thirds of voters across San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, the tax would generate an estimated $108 million annually. The funding is desperately needed to operate the system as ridership has plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic., who authored the measure, said.
San Francisco supervisors already approved the tax measure, authored by Supervisor Shamann Walton, during a meeting last week. That version, however, included conditions calling for Caltrain to change its governance structure and separate itself from the San Mateo County Transportation District, which operates Caltrain.
The move drew criticism from San Mateo County officials, many of whom alleged the condition would make the tax harder for voters to approve, putting Caltrain funding and service altogether in danger.
However, since then officials from all three counties have agreed to remove the governance issues from the measure and pass a new amended version that solely calls for the tax, in the hope that it could get approved by county leaders in all three counties by the Friday deadline.
""Since our last meeting, we have been working with San Mateo and Santa Clara counties literally nightly and in the mornings for most of this last week in order to come up with an agreement that would address our governance concerns and be best for Caltrain,"" Walton said.
The governance issues instead were presented as recommendations to the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, which oversees Caltrain and is made up of representatives from the three counties, during a meeting on Thursday. The recommendations, which include, among others, allowing the JPB to appoint its own executive director, special counsel and auditor, separate from SamTrans, were approved.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is the last body needed to approve the sales tax measure, effectively placing the measure on the November ballot.
The JPB, the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority Board of Directors, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors, the SamTrans Board of Directors, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, and the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors have all already approved the measure.
""Even though we've had a tumultuous fight and we've had to go through a lot of adversity to get to this point, we will be making history if we can get this two-thirds measure passed, as this will be the first ever dedicated funding source for Caltrain. So, that is something we can all be excited about,"" Walton said.
""It's official, the measure has passed and will be on the November 2020 ballot! Thank you to everyone who made this happen!"" Caltrain officials said Friday on Twitter, following San Francisco supervisors' vote.
If approved by voters, Caltrain could start seeing the funds as early as April 2021.

Liccardo said by not counting individuals fully, the White House would be in clear violation of the 14th Amendment.
""In San José, and under the U.S. Constitution, everyone counts,"" Liccardo said. ""It is astounding that 132 years after we wiped the abhorrent 'three-fifths' clause from Article I of our U.S. Constitution, and as our nation yearns for racial equity, we have a Presidential Administration seeking to return to the days prior to the passage of the 14th Amendment.""
On July 21, the president released a memorandum directing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which overlooks the Census Bureau, to discount undocumented residents and count certain immigrants when determining congressional seats.
The lawsuit alleges that the Presidents memorandum violates the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of intentional discrimination against persons of color in the 14th Amendment, the Enumeration Clause of Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution and the Census Act.
It was filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by the city of San Jose, the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, King County in Washington and Arlington County in Virginia. Other individual plaintiffs include Zerihoun Yilma and Lovette Kargbo-Thompson.
In Santa Clara County, nearly 10 percent of the population is undocumented, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center study.
""This blatantly racist decree from the president cannot go without a strong and fervent challenge from those who seek to sustain our nation's Constitutional protections,"" Liccardo said.
