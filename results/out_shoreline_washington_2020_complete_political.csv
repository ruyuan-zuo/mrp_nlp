April 9, 2020
The Governor's Stay Home, Stay Healthy order remains in effect through May 4. Abiding by the Stay Home order is critical to stopping the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Our frontline medical workers, vulnerable residents, and displaced workers need you to stay home. Nice weather makes it tempting to go somewhere or do something, but now is not the time. The statewide ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy"" order requires us to stick very close to home - your yard and your neighborhood. Help slow the spread of COVID-19 and save lives.
All Shoreline residents need to follow the Governor's order and stay home, unless you are:
We urge everyone, even people who are young and healthy, to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19. If you must go out, stay at least six feet apart from others. This includes in our parks and at the beach. Staying home and avoiding all non-essential contact with others is the best way to stay healthy, keep others healthy, and prevent the new coronavirus from suddenly spreading rapidly and overwhelming our healthcare system.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is highly contagious, and each face-to-face interaction is an opportunity for it to spread.

David Chen is a first-time candidate running to unseat longtime Councilwoman Doris McConnell. Chen said in a statement Thursday that he quit his job as CRISTA's general counsel in protest.
""Every person—regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, and religion—deserves equal rights and to be treated with dignity and respect. The letter sent by my former employer in July detailing their anti-LGBTQ+ beliefs made working for them untenable. The positions reflected in CRISTA's letter are wrong. This kind of discrimination by an organization that is supposed to support and educate students is completely unacceptable,"" Chen's statement read.
On Monday, the Seattle Times reported that several teachers quit King's High School after leaders told staff that CRISTA's officials stance is that marriage should only be between one man and one woman.
CRISTA is a global Christian powerhouse, operating schools, media outlets, and senior living facilities. The ministry operates several schools in the area, including the King's Schools campus in Shoreline. This year, CRISTA opened the Seattle Urban Academy along Renton Avenue in South Seattle.
Chen emerged from the August primary in the top spot, earning just under 50 percent of the 13,200 votes cast in the Position 4 race. McConnell earned about 32.5 percent of the vote, but has said that she barely had time to campaign due to a family issue."

The Eastside dog park is located at the state Department of Social and Health Services-owned Fircrest campus. The city's lease with the state expires on Dec. 31. City officials say they will try to work with DSHS on a compromise.
""The city has leased the Eastside Off-Leash Dog Park from DSHS for the past six years. As the landlord, DSHS has the authority to make these changes. However, we will continue to work collaboratively with them to see if we can help resolve their concerns around safety and access in order to keep this valuable amenity accessible to our community,"" city officials said in a statement on Friday.
The Fircrest campus is home to about 200 developmentally disabled adults, and has occupied the property since 1959. The dog park is located on the south end of the campus west of South Woods Park. DSHS over the Labor Day weekend began closing the gates at the entrance to the park at 6 p.m. each night, reopening them at 6 a.m. each morning.
The city's other dog park is at Shoreview Park. There is an off-leash area at Richmond Beach Park that's open between November and March each year."
5,/washington/shoreline/shoreline-city-council-approve-gender-neutral-language,2019-09-04T15:22:38Z,Gender-Neutral Shoreline Council Meetings,0,0,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA — The Shoreline City Council is headed toward approving a change to its rules that would remove gender pronouns from meeting language.
Councilman Chris Roberts proposed the idea in early August to help non-binary people feel more included in city business.
""Throughout the Council Rules there are gender references (he/she, him/her) for the Mayor and Councilmembers. The amendment will replace these references with gender-neutral language to be inclusive of people who are gender non-binary,"" a Shoreline city staff report described the change.
Roberts said he got the idea after serving on the state Democratic party rules committee. In 2016, the party noticed that presidential delegates were required to be either men or women, which caused non-binary Democrats to ask for change.
""Two years working with that opened my eyes to whenever I see he or him, or he and her, in government documents,"" Roberts said.
He raised the issue at the Aug. 12 Council dinner meeting, and the rest of Council agreed that the change should be made, he said.
Shoreline isn't the first government in Washington to make the bureaucracy more gender-neutral.
In 2016, King County voters approved a measure that would remove gendered language from the King County Charter and the King County Code. The Council passed ordinances in 2018 to complete that work.
""The ordinance replaces gendered pronouns such as he, him, she, or her with the title of the subject in impacted sentences. For example 'he' could be converted to the position's title such as 'director.' The ordinance will also take the gendered pronoun out of terms such as 'workmanship' which could be converted to 'quality of work,"" a March 2018 county press release described.
But way back in 2013, Washington lawmakers completed a six-year edit of state law to remove references to gender. Words like ""freshman"" became ""first-year student,"" for example.
Washington now also has an option for people to select ""X"" as a gender on drivers licenses, indicating someone who doesn't identify as either a man or woman.
The Shoreline Council will vote to make the change on Sept. 9 along with a few other changes to Council rules, including banning the promotion of political candidates during public comment, and loosening rules around when Councilmembers' surnames have to be used."

Jay Inslee hitting his goal of 130,000 donors Gov. Jay Inslee leaving the presidential race and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's upcoming Seattle town hall on Sunday, we wanted to take a look at which 2020 candidates Puget Sound residents are backing with campaign donations.
For this analysis, we used Federal Elections Commission campaign finance data from Jan. 1 to June 30. We only looked at the 18 cities covered by Patch in Puget Sound. Not only did we look at how much money each candidate raked in, we also looked at how many donations they got — and how many of those were from one-time donors.
In general, Puget Sound — except for Inslee — is tracking with national polls in support for candidates. That means people like Bernie Sanders, Warren, and even Donald Trump are pretty popular. There were pockets of support for long-shot candidates like Marianne Williamson and Rep. Tim Ryan.
Here are some quick takeaways:
Here are the top five by total amount of money raised:
Here are the top five with the highest percentage of unique donors
But none of those candidates — including Weld, who's running against Trump — really have a shot of winning the nomination. Bullock, the governor of Montana, has raised the most out of the bunch at only $33,000. So here are the top five front-runner Democrats with the highest number of individual donations. We're using the most recent CNN poll for candidates with 5 percent support or better.
And finally, here are those five candidates arranged by most donations including repeat donors.
Here's a look at the top five 2020 candidates residents inside Shoreline only donated to:

7,/washington/shoreline/shoreline-woodinville-northshore-fire-depts-explore-merger,2019-08-16T00:02:05Z,"Fire District Merger In Woodinville, Shoreline?",0,0,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA — The Shoreline, Woodinville, and Northshore fire departments are studying whether to merge into a single firefighting agency that would cover over 100,000 people living in North King County.
The talks are in early stages, but the commissioners for each department have already met twice this summer. Ahead of planned meetings in August and September, the three districts are crunching numbers to see if combining operations would save money, Shoreline Fire Chief Matt Cowan and Woodinville fire officials say. The districts are also working on a draft organizational chart.
""We want to take the best things we're doing and incorporate that into the new organization,"" Cowan said.
The three departments already often assist each other on calls. And all three, plus the city of Bothell department, are on the verge of combining training operations. That could be complete by early 2020, Cowan said.
""I can't imagine the timing being better. We all have great support from the community, we're all financially viable,"" Cowan said. ""One of the biggest overreaching factors as well is we all have retirements occurring.""
A wave of attrition through retirements, Cowan said, could help make consolidation easier. The new department would only need one fire chief, for example.
There are several options for a merger. The departments could form a regional fire authority (RFA), creating a new municipal corporation with the ability to levy taxes. There are three RFAs in King County: Renton, which covers the entire city east to an unincorporated area near Issaquah; Puget Sound, which serves Covington, Kent, and SeaTac; and Valley Regional, covering Auburn, Pacific, and Algona.
If the three departments form an RFA, citizens in each area may still have elected fire commissioners. The Renton Regional Fire Authority, for example, includes the city of Renton and King County Fire District 25, which serves an unincorporated area east of Renton with about 10,000 residents. King County Fire District 25 maintains its own independent three-member board of commissioners, but those three commissioners also sit on the larger Renton Regional Fire Authority board.
Another option would be for the cities involved — including the Northshore cities of Kenmore and Lake Forest Park — to consolidate fire services into one new agency run through an interlocal agreement. An example of that model is Eastside Fire and Rescue, which provides protection for Sammamish, Issaquah, North Bend, and other communities along I-90.
This isn't the fire push for consolidation in North King County. In 2015, Woodinville, Northshore, and the city of Bothell explored forming and RFA, but decided not to move forward."

The measure approved by City Council Monday night is slightly larger than the $88 million plan that has been bounced around for months.
If approved, most of the money would be spent on a new 75,000 square-foot aquatics facility — the city is calling it the ""ShARCC"" or Shoreline Aquatics, Recreation, and Community Center — with rooms for community events, a walking and jogging track, an 8-lane lap pool with room for 500 spectators, and an activity pool that will feature a ""lazy river.""
The facility would replace the Shoreline Pool and the Spartan Recreation Center, which are both more than 40 years old.
City officials estimate the bond measure will cost about $20 extra per month for homes valued around $500,000.
The rest of the money will be used to make upgrades at city parks, like adding new play equipment and building splash pads. Brugger's Bog, Hillwood, Richmond Highlands, and Hamlin Park are part of the upgrade plan.

10,/washington/shoreline/shoreline-2019-primary-guide-city-council-position-4-race,2019-07-24T15:04:53Z,Shoreline 2019 Primary Guide,0,0,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA — The 2019 August primary is coming up on Aug. 6, and one Shoreline City Council race will be on the ballot. We sent each candidate in the race a questionnaire to help local voters pick the right candidate.
In the Position 4 race, Shoreline residents will choose between incumbent Councilwoman Doris McConnell, CRISTA Ministries chief legal officer David Chen, and Shoreline Lake Forest Park Senior Center board member Ginny Scantlebury.
We asked each candidate the same set of four questions, probing everything from development around light rail stations to their favorite city park. We did not edit the answers for either content or length.
Here's what they told us:
Why did you decide to run for this seat? If you're the incumbent, why do you want to keep your seat on Council?
As a lifelong area resident, Shorecrest graduate, and father of three raising a young family in the Echo Lake Neighborhood, I have seen a lot of change come to Shoreline. I believe that change and growth should benefit current and future generations of Shoreline residents, and I want to bring the community together to address the challenges we face. The arrival of the light rail is a huge asset which needs to be harnessed. To build strong neighborhoods and support small business growth, we need to overhaul Shoreline's land use, zoning, and design codes to create a welcoming urban environment, more community gathering space, and walkable commercial districts.
What's your vision for growth around the future light rail stations?
I hope the light rail stations will be more than just transportation hubs, but a place that the community can gather to work, live, and play. The city should invest now in ensuring open space in the subarea stations and help small businesses establish areas that invite the community to enjoy the opportunities within their neighborhoods. Design can be used to create a healthier balance between nature and city and build more inclusive and equitable communities.
What's your favorite city park and why?
Growing up in my family's Chinese restaurant on 97th and Aurora, my favorite park is ""Park at Town Center"" on 175th and Midvale because of the opportunity I see to bring more activation, public space, and enjoyment to the more dense and diverse areas of Shoreline around the Aurora corridor. We need to be more balanced in investing in areas that have traditionally been under-represented and under-invested in. I have a vision of a future that establishes the Town Center of Shoreline as an area that brings diverse communities together with more public art, restaurants and public space for the community to share. We can build a space that welcomes the entire community, from families, to seniors, to office workers, and individuals of all ages and abilities to enjoy community events, farmers' markets, green space, and a safe and walkable business district.
When was the last time you rode either a bus or bike in Shoreline and what was your experience?
Last week. Biking with young children in Shoreline is challenging. Bike lanes on arterial streets are difficult for many cyclists, including families and seniors. We need more safe dedicated trails, buffered lanes, sidewalks and areas for non-motorized vehicles to travel between parks, neighborhoods and business districts.
Why did you decide to run for this seat? If you're the incumbent, why do you want to keep your seat on Council?
I love representing this community and I have tried to use my time on the council to give a voice to the concerns of our city's residents. I strive to reach out to community leaders and citizens prior to a council discussion. Seeking their thoughts gives me much needed information and helps me to see an issue from many perspectives outside of what we get in staff reports. My years of experience on the council have given me a sincere desire to be accessible and I respect and appreciate the feedback I get from my community. I believe my vote on issues should be a reflection of the vision of Shoreline's residents and they often are.
Since I have been on council, one of my goals was to move forward with what is now named
Shoreline Place. There are areas in Shoreline like this that are stagnant and take much heavy lifting to create a more vibrant area. I have focused my energy to help move the needle so to speak and we are now preparing to vote on this. The council is also at the cusp of another important project I have been a part of, which is to replace the community swimming pool, which is in severe deferred maintenance. The incorporation of the senior program, a commercial kitchen, and additional community spaces in this design are important additions that I supported and now they are incorporated into the plan.
What's your vision for growth around the future light rail stations?
The future growth and development around our two future light rail stations has been planned and vetted by the city staff and council, with the help of community input. I have been there from the beginning as one on the council who started this process to its final rezone votes. In this process, I supported some of the rezone votes but not the ones that appeared to extend too far from the stations. I also voted to preserve single-family zoning around Paramount Park and Open Space to ensure that expanding the park with city funds would be affordable. This vote did not pass. I believe the council will have to continue to monitor for adequate parking in the new developments so that these additional cars do not encroach into the neighborhoods. I am a strong voice for assuring adequate parking is supplied by developments.
What's your favorite city park and why?
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park is my favorite park because of its size and views of the water/mountains. I love how much the park has to offer with the additional bonus of the spectacular views. The entire park has water or mountain views so that people can spread out and still feel like they are enjoying a moment of solitude with nature. The sunsets are gorgeous and people come around that time of day to enjoy it as well as take pictures. Many stairs for exercise, picnic tables, BBQ pits, play areas, benches, sandy beaches and an abundance of parking at all levels are the many things that draws residents and nonresidents to this park.
When was the last time you rode either a bus or bike in Shoreline and what was your experience?
I've ridden a bus to many events in Seattle and bike on the Interurban Trail for exercise. It is an
excellent trail for me for my STP training rides. As our population increases, residents will add more cars to our already clogged streets, particularly during rush hour. Increasing bike lanes in Shoreline and Seattle has gotten a lot of people out of their cars, which is great for the community.
Why did you decide to run for this seat? If you're the incumbent, why do you want to keep your seat on Council?
I have been a part of large groups in the past 6 years where we have collected signatures, gone to city council and special meetings, etc. etc.. In all cases, the city council and staff had already decided what their decision was before we even had a chance to provide input. I feel that this is wrong! Our city council is supposed to represent us. That is what I want to do and I have been doorbelling all over the city for 3 months to talk to Shoreline residents and find out what their needs and desires are.
What's your vision for growth around the future light rail stations?
I feel that Sound Transit's vision for this growth was perfect – high density housing ½ mail radius around each of our 2 light rail stations – 145th and 185th. Unfortunately, our staff and city council chose a different method of zoning and the area is spread out with very little growth close to the light rail stations at this time. I believe the reason Sound Transit made this suggestion is that along with the high density housing, there can also be a commercial area nearby too so that residents can walk to almost all their needs. This would be the efficient way to have the growth.
What's your favorite city park and why?
My favorite city park is Hamlin Park. It has something for everyone. We have personally enjoyed the trails all over the park (especially during the fall when we can see the variety of mushrooms); softball games when our daughters were growing up; taking our grand dogs for walks; observing the beautiful old evergreen trees and watching kids play on the equipment.
When was the last time you rode either a bus or bike in Shoreline and what was your experience?
I rode a bike in Shoreline on the Interurban Trail about 2 years ago. Unfortunately, there are many residents in Shoreline who don't seem to care about keeping our city clean and this was very obvious on the Interurban Trail. If we could take care of this situation, it would be a lot nicer and safer for all of us."

The $88.1 proposed aquatic center would be located at 17828 Midvale Ave. North and include an eight-lane lap pool, room for 500 spectators, and a 6,000 square-foot community space. There would also be two gyms, an exercise room and jogging track, and rooms for classes and to rent, according to city plans. The city is also considering using some bond revenue for parks upgrades.
At the June 24 meeting, the Council indicated its intention to put the measure on the November ballot. But a final vote won't happen until July 29.
Here's more on the need for pro and con writers for the ballot statement from a city press release:
Accompanying the November ballots will be the King County Voters' Pamphlet. The pamphlet will include an explanatory statement from the City that states the effect of a bond measure if approved. In response will be statements in support and opposition to the ballot measure. State law requires the City Council to appoint two committees to draft the pro and con statements. The committees can have no more than three members each; however, the committees may seek advice from any person or persons. The committees will also have an opportunity to write a rebuttal statement to the other side's statement.
Individuals interested in applying for one of the committee positions can fill out an online application. Applications are due by August 2 at 10:00 a.m. The City Council will review the applications and appoint the committee members at its August 5 business meeting.

13,/washington/shoreline/crime-fighting-toilet-coming-shoreline-park,2019-07-09T17:26:07Z,Famous Toilet In Shoreline,0,1,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA — City officials are preparing to buy a crime-fighting toilet to replace one at a city park that was damaged by fire.
At its next meeting on July 15, the City Council is expected to approve spending $115,000 to buy a Portland Loo — a special type of toilet designed to withstand the urban environment. Shoreline's loo will be installed at Echo Lake Park.
The loo was created more than a decade ago when city officials in Portland needed a durable public bathroom to handle a growing homeless population. The loos are made of curved stainless steel, and don't have parts that can be ripped out or damaged, according to the manufacturer. They also have open tops and bottoms, making it hard for prostitution and drug activity to take place.
Echo Lake Park's bathrooms have been a magnet for criminal activity, city officials say.
""The existing restroom facility at Echo Lake Park has experienced severe societal issues, including vandalism and criminal activity. The restroom has also been closed due to fire damage. Staff believes that this is partly due to its current site configuration and location at the back of the park,"" city administrators wrote in a memo to City Council.
Nearby cities like Seattle, Oak Harbor, and Olympia all have installed Portland Loos. But the toilets are also being used outside the Pacific Northwest in cities like Denver, Boston, New York, and Cincinnati."

The Council will likely vote on the matter at the end of July, just a few days shy of the deadline to place the measure on the November ballot.
The proposed aquatic center would be located at 17828 Midvale Ave North and include an eight-lane lap pool, room for 500 spectators, and a 6,000 square-foot community space. There would also be two gyms, an exercise room and jogging track, and rooms for classes and to rent, according to city plans.
The total size would be about 75,000 square-feet, and construction would likely begin in 2021.
The aquatic center would replace the Shoreline Pool, which was built in 1971 and is costing the city lots to maintain. Apart from significant renovations, the city wants to get rid of the pool's boiler because it accounts puts out 92 percent the city's greenhouse gas emissions.
If approved, property owners would see a jump in taxes, but only temporarily. The aquatics center bonds would be paid off over the course of 20 years, but during the first two years, property owners will still be paying the 2006 parks and open spaces bond measure. Here are the current estimates for how much the taxes would increase after November through 2022:
The City Council will likely vote on the aquatics center proposal on July 29. The deadline to submit measures for the November King County ballot is Aug. 6. The aquatics center is up for discussion on the June 24 Council meeting agenda."

16,/washington/shoreline/shoreline-may-ask-voters-88m-aquatics-center,2019-05-14T16:45:11Z,Shoreline May Ask Voters For $88M Aquatics Center,0,0,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA — Shoreline voters might be asked to approve a bond measure in November ballot to build an $88.1 million aquatics center along Midvale Avenue.
The City Council will review the proposal at the May 20 meeting. The proposed aquatic center would include an eight-lane lap pool, room for 500 spectators, and a 6,000 square-foot community space. The city would also ask the Shoreline School District to contribute to the project through either a direct capital contribution or a rental agreement.
The aquatic center would replace the Shoreline Pool, which was built in 1971 and is costing the city lots to maintain. Apart from significant renovations, the city wants to get rid of the pool's boiler because it accounts puts out 92 percent the city's greenhouse gas emissions.
City staff are recommending a 20-year bond measure that would cost the owner of a $480,000 home about $22 per month, according to preliminary estimates.
The sooner the measure goes to voters, the cheaper the cost of building the aquatics center will be, according to city documents. Delaying the bond measure until spring or fall 2020 would add an estimated $200,000 in inflated construction costs.
The Council may also choose to put a bigger bond measure on the ballot to build the aquatics center and upgrade four city parks (Brugger's Bog Park, Richmond Highlands, Hillcrest, and Briarwood). The alternative $106 million measure would cost the owner of a $480,000 home an additional $5 per month, according to estimates.
City Council could vote on bond measure size and language as soon as the June 24 Council meeting. The measure has to be submitted to King County by Aug. 6 to get on the November ballot.
Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Spartan Recreation Center has a pool."
17,/washington/shoreline/david-chen-running-shoreline-council-urbanist-ideas,2019-04-17T18:59:25Z,David Chen Running For Shoreline Council,0,1,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA — Longtime Shoreline resident David Chen is formally announcing his bid to win the Position 4 seat on City Council this week, and wants to use regional collaboration and urbanist ideas to tackle problems like affordable housing, homelessness, and transportation.
Chen will be vying for a seat against three-term incumbent Deputy Mayor Doris McConnell. She confirmed on Wednesday that she is running for reelection in 2019. Chen acknowledges that running for a well-known candidate's seat is tough, but says the time is right for him to run because of mounting issues facing Shoreline.
At the top of Chen's list is affordable housing. With the arrival of light rail in 2024, he sees the opportunity to tweak zoning code to allow for higher-density developments near transit hubs. He also wants to see housing opportunities suitable for seniors to ""age in place"" in Shoreline.
Chen also sees housing affordability as one way to alleviate homelessness in Shoreline. He also wants to help create more living wage jobs. That would take a combination of new businesses coming to the city and creating pathways for people to get vocational training at Shoreline Community College, he said.
Asked about the ""Seattle Is Dying"" side of homelessness, Chen says residents absolutely must feel safe in Shoreline — but arresting people for using drugs or camping in public likely won't really fix the problem.
""We can't simply exacerbate this recidivist cycle using a criminal justice-focused attitude,"" he said.
Chen, 34, works as the chief legal officer for CRISTA Ministries, a multi-faceted Christian ministry based in Shoreline. He has been a board member for the homelessness nonprofit Vision House, and is about to join the Rave Foundation board, which is the Seattle Sounders' nonprofit arm.
He is graduate of Shorecrest High School, Western Washington University, and Seattle University. Chen lives with his wife and three kids in the Echo Lake area.
A third candidate, Virginia Scantlebury, has registered a campaign with the state Public Disclosure Commission for the position 4 seat. She has raised about $2,300 for her campaign so far compared to Chen's $3,600.
So far, Chen has attracted endorsements from former Seattle Mayor and Councilman Tim Burgess, former Seattle Councilman John Okamoto, and former Shoreline Councilwoman Shari Winstead.
""Democracy is about getting out there. There is a value in, rather than waiting for the blessing for succession, having the opportunity for voters to have the representatives they want,"" he said."
18,/washington/shoreline/shoreline-recycling-rates-may-increase-trade-war-partly-blame,2019-03-12T18:07:46Z,Shoreline May Increase Recycling Rates,0,0,Neal McNamara ,Patch Staff,"SHORELINE, WA - The Shoreline City Council will consider a proposal to increase recycling rates due to volatility in the global recycling market.
Shoreline began a 10-year contract with Recology CleanScapes on March 1, 2017. In August, Recology informed Council of rising recycling costs. That month, China, the largest importer of recyclables, imposed a 25 percent tariff on items like corrugated cardboard and plastic scraps. That tariff is related to a trade war between the U.S. and China.
In January 2018, China stopped buying imported plastic scrap that wasn't 99.5 percent pure.
""The changing material specifications, import bans, tariffs and other disruptions have forced local collection companies to increase processing levels, shift to other markets with higher shipping costs and more aggressively control contamination levels in a market with dropping prices for recycled materials,"" Council staff wrote in a briefing on the increase.
If the proposal is approved, Shoreline's recycling rates would increase $1.35 per month for residents and $2.10 per yard for multifamily property owners. The increase would generate $572,000 annually, which Recology would use to ""eliminate problematic materials from collection points through education and incentives, an increase in monitoring and rejection of unacceptable material at the curb, as well as support for material handling process changes.""
The proposal will be up for discussion at the March 18 Council meeting. Council will likely not take action until April."

Pratt Work Earns Her King County Award,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"SHORELINE-LAKE FOREST, WA - From King County Government: A grade schooler celebrating the life and legacy of a civil rights pioneer. Two people meeting the challenge of helping the homeless and creating affordable housing. The late advocate for the communities of South King County and a man who lead the fight to rename a Seattle street in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. What do they have in common? Going above and beyond in their efforts to make a difference in communities across King County.
Today the Metropolitan King County Council awarded nine citizens the Martin Luther King, Jr. Medal of Distinguished Service, an accolade recognizing those who are committed to public service.
This is the fourth year Councilmembers have recognized individuals in their districts that have answered the question asked by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ""What are you doing for others?"" Today's recipients have helped in their communities in a number of ways:
Council Chair Rod Dembowski recognized 11-year old Sarah Haycox, who has worked to honor the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader Edwin T. Pratt, who invested his life in justice and economic parity, and as director of the Seattle Urban League, was instrumental in the efforts to desegregate schools and fight housing discrimination in the Seattle area.
Councilmember Larry Gossett presented the medal to civil rights activist Eddie Rye, Jr., who among his half-century of community advocacy was responsible for the effort to rename Seattle's Empire Way into Martin Luther King, Jr. Way.
Councilmember Kathy Lambert celebrated the work of Amy Biggs, who help save the Snoqualmie Valley Transit system and has been a tireless advocate for the residents of the Snoqualmie Valley.
Councilmember Jeanne Kohl-Welles recognized human rights advocate Cindy Domingo, a tireless advocate for underrepresented communities and communities of color, who helped shine a spotlight on the actions of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the man responsible for the assassination of her brother.
Councilmember Dave Upthegrove recognized the late Amina Ahmed, who was a trailblazing voice and advocate for communities in South King County.
Council Vice Chair Claudia Balducci awarded the medal to the Rev. James McEachran, who retired as pastor of St. Andrew's Lutheran Church in Bellevue after a full career serving the needs of people on the Eastside, including helping to create Imagine Housing, the Eastside's leading affordable housing organization.
Councilmember Pete von Reichbauer celebrated the work of Peggy LaPorte, who took an idea of helping homeless women and their children from her Federal Way kitchen table and established FUSION (Friends United to Shelter the Indigent, Oppressed, and Needy), an all-volunteer non-profit helping families out of homelessness and into permanent housing.
Councilmember Joe McDermott recognized Renèe Hopkins, the CEO for the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, an advocate for responsible gun ownership and working to have gun violence recognized as a public health as well as a public safety issue.
Council Vice Chair Reagan Dunn presented the medal to Christine Williams, who as the coordinator for the Neighbors Feeding Neighbors (NFN) senior hot meals program and a bus driver of special needs students, delivers food and children throughout the city of Enumclaw.
Today's recipients were selected by the Councilmembers in each respective district. The annual presentation of the MLK Medal of Distinguished Service is the Council's way of thanking those who have made a particularly strong impact on the county and to encourage others to renew their dedication to serve their community.
