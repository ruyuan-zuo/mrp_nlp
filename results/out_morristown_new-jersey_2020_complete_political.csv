Phil Murphy has been lifting his coronavirus restrictions over the last several weeks, but says he wants more data before moving the Garden State to ""stage two.""
So he's asking that residents get tested, and he gave some hints that he's ready to announce more reopenings as early as Friday because of the progress New Jersey has made in diagnosing and containing the virus. Read more: Gov. Murphy: 'Hard Dates' For NJ Coronavirus Reopening (UPDATE)
""Every resident in every community has a role to play in our restart and recovery,"" Murphy said at a news conference this week. ""And every resident that gets tested sends a strong message to their neighbors that they are ready to be a part of a bright future for our state.""
Murphy had set a goal of 20,000 tests per day by the end of May, a goal that was met last week. By meeting that goal, New Jersey could find itself moving to stage two as early as this week.
That stage would mean allowing work activities at physical locations if they adhere to safeguarding and modification guidelines.
Phased-in businesses may include:
In stage two, all workers who can work from home continue to do so.
""The more people that do get tested the stronger our data becomes and the stronger our data becomes the stronger our confidence will become that we can take the next steps in responsibly restarting our economy and getting our recovery underway,"" Murphy said.
Murphy did say that New Jersey's numbers backslid slightly on Thursday, noting that the rate of new hospitalizations ticked up slightly. Read more: Gov. Murphy: NJ Backslides Slightly In Coronavirus Outbreak
But Murphy also said that New Jersey is making progress to the point that people may be better able to ""trust"" that they'll be safe to get a haircut or send their kids to daycare.
""Without this trust there can be no restart or recovery,"" he said. ""No one is going to want to go to a restaurant or a store or the gym or to the beach or a graduation if they don't have confidence that they can safely do so.""
Murphy said that building out capacity is key with 164 sites both publicly and privately up and running across the state. Click here to find out where you can get tested.
""Growing our capacity to meet our testing goal is only half the battle,"" he said. ""You getting tested, by the way, is the other half.""
Reiterating that data determines dates, Murphy said New Jersey can't consider specific timetables until specific benchmarks on key factors are met.
""In our hospitals we have seen the numbers we've needed to see to begin our restart,"" he said. ""We need to keep working, and we need to get more data. More data means we get a better picture and more data means we get a better sense of where COVID-19 still exists and where hot spots could become flareups, so we can take quick corrective measures to stamp them out. And that data must come first and foremost from a rigorous testing program.""
New Jersey began COVID-19 testing mid-March with a few hundred tests a day. By the end of that month that number had swelled to 6,000. April saw it double to 12,000 as New Jersey moved closer to the goal of 20,000 tests a day be the end of May.
""I noted that number wouldn't be our ceiling but rather a floor,"" Murphy said.
On Friday there were 27,000 tests, Saturday there were 30,000 and Sunday 21,000 tests. There were 16,000 tests on Memorial Day Monday and Murphy noted that Tuesday the numbers rebounded to 24,400.

""Currently, New Jersey is ahead of 46 other states in terms of testing per capita and still climbing,"" Murphy said. ""We know that our goals are well within reach and that is a good place for us to be given where we were two months ago. And the data that we get from these tests is invaluable. Out of the 30,000 tests recorded on May 23 only 7 percent were positive.
Murphy said it is not just the data coming but what has already been collected that will allow NJ to move to stage two.
""When you look at a spot positivity rate in the single digits, boy, that gives you a lot of confidence,"" he said. ""And when you take out the serology tests and you look at the 'do you have it at this moment in time' that's hugely valuable so the more data you have in that respect the more confidence we have.""
Department of Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said the data will allow for the most important containment activity available: isolation and quarantine.
""In order to do that you need to test people, find the positives, isolate positives find their contacts and isolate and quarantine depending on their symptoms,"" she said. ""That's the best tool we have in our toolkit to stop the spread.""

3,/new-jersey/morristown/schools-taxes-internet-big-decisions-nj-amid-coronavirus,2020-04-14T13:19:47Z,Big Decisions Coming Amid NJ Coronavirus,0,20,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY — One month after virtually everything was shut down in New Jersey, the questions are getting louder: When — or will — a decision be made to close schools for the rest of the year?
And Gov. Phil Murphy said he's also heard the pleas from people who've asked for a break on their phone and cable bills, as well as their Internet service, amid the coronavirus outbreak.
All of that has become so much more important as many parents are confined to their homes — many of them laid off — and making sure remote learning is working for their children.
Some important news is expected to come this week, and over the past several days, Murphy has provided a glimpse — or more — on what he's going to do about the schools, your cable, phone and Internet bills and your taxes during the coronavirus crisis.
Here is some insight on what to expect:
Schools
Murphy insisted during a weekend news conference that no decisions have been made on reopening the schools before the 2019-20 year ends. But he did say that he's sticking with a date he's talked about for possibly making a decision: Friday.
Murphy has said that Friday would be the day when New Jersey will likely have a clearer picture as to what lies ahead, and he promised to provide an update on the school situation by then.
During his Tuesday press conference, Murphy did provide some idea as to where his administration may be heading, and he seemed to suggest that some sort of reopening could happen.
""Some of you interpreted, I think, my saying we'll make a binary yes-or-no decision on whether or not we're going to close (schools) or stay remote for the rest of the year,"" Murphy said. ""That's actually not the case. We're looking at a number of different alternatives.""
Even though New Jersey's case and hospitalization rates have been flattening, however, Murphy said over the weekend that he's not interested in ""throwing gasoline on the fire"" and reopening the economy too soon before the virus is under control. Read more: NJ Coronavirus Updates: Here's What You Need To Know
Murphy said any decision would have to have ""some harmony"" in the region and be consistent with what neighboring states are doing.
Pennsylvania has already closed schools for the rest of the year. Also, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania are joining a coalition of six states hardest hit by the new coronavirus to form a task force for a regional approach to reopen their states in the wake of the outbreak. Read more: NJ, PA Join Regional Coronavirus Reopening Council
""I've been lobbied hard by parents to open schools,"" Murphy said. ""But we have to make our decisions based on data and facts.""
Internet, phone and cable bills
Murphy signed an executive order Monday prohibiting cable and telecommunications providers from terminating Internet and voice service due to nonpayment until 30 days after the current public health emergency has ended.
The order also prohibits all service downgrades, service reductions or late fees due to nonpayment unless they are essentially approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. Additionally, any Internet or voice service that was disconnected after March 16 due to nonpayment must be reconnected.
""Most of our service providers voluntarily took these steps, in accordance with FCC policy, to protect their customers during this difficult time, and we are grateful for their partnership,"" Murphy said. ""However, these policies have been implemented inconsistently among companies, so today we are prohibiting the termination of internet and voice services due to nonpayment during this time.""
Murphy noted that children need Internet access for remote learning, and ""our workforce needs the resources to telework, and families need to be able to keep each other informed. It is critical for our New Jersey residents to maintain these connections and not have their ability to communicate with the outside world severed.""
Taxes
Murphy announced his intention to sign a bill into a law Tuesday to extend New Jersey's income and corporate tax filing deadline to July 15. The bill received final passage in the Legislature.
""As we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that we give both the state and our residents every opportunity to endure financially,"" Murphy said. ""Pushing this deadline into the summer will give us additional time to combat the virus and get as many taxpayers as possible back on sound financial footing.""
The COVID-19 Fiscal Mitigation Act, (A-3918) extends the deadline for both gross income tax and corporation business tax filings, aligning New Jersey with the new federal deadline announced late last month.
Additionally, the bill extends the 2020 fiscal year to Sept. 30. The bill also extends the deadline for the quarterly payment due this week to July 15. The second-quarter payment will still be due June 15.
In addition to extending the filing deadline, the bill requires the state treasurer to report by May 22 on the financial condition of the budget for Fiscal Years 2020 and 2021. It also requires that, by Aug. 25, the governor will submit a revised budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2021.
The bill was sponsored in the Senate by Sens. Paul Sarlo, Steven Oroho and Anthony M. Bucco, and in the Assembly by Assemblymembers Eliana Pintor Marin, Harold Wirths and John Burzichelli.
""The ongoing public health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic is creating severe financial hardship for the people of New Jersey as well as fiscal fallout for the state,"" Sarlo said. ""We don't yet know the full dimensions of the financial consequences for residents, businesses and the state, but there is no doubt that we all face some hard times. The extensions will give taxpayers more time to calculate and manage their finances, and will provide state officials a workable timetable to craft a budget that addresses our critical needs.""

How It Spreads
The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19.
While the best way to prevent illness is to avoid virus exposure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention always recommends taking preventive actions to contain the spread of viruses.

NEW JERSEY – Expect the June 2 primary election to be delayed as New Jersey continues to deal with the effects of the coronavirus crisis, and lawmakers have a new date in mind.

Sources told Patch that New Jersey will likely postpone its June 2 primary election to July 7, expecting that the coronavirus outbreak will continue to have an impact into the summer.
The possible postponement comes as the number of cases continues to rise in New Jersey. Murphy will speak at a news conference at 1 p.m. Wednesday, and Patch will cover it live. Read more: NJ Coronavirus Updates: Here's What You Need To Know
Last week, Murphy said the Democratic Party's decision to move the national presidential convention to Aug. 17 gave New Jersey ""a lot more flexibility than I thought we had two days ago.""
""We're going to make a decision on that very soon, but I'll be stunned if we stay at June 2,"" Murphy said.
The governor already has taken some steps to make sure that the coronavirus outbreak doesn't impact elections that were supposed to be held in the spring, either postponing them or requiring a vote by mail. Read more: Governor Murphy Moves NJ School District Election Deadlines
The filing deadline for running for the primary elections was March 30, and many candidates are slated to run for local elections. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are expected to square off in the Democratic presidential primary.
Murphy offered some insight into how long the coronavirus crisis may last in New Jersey just as he was providing an update to the outbreak's toll on Monday: 3,663 new cases and 86 more deaths. The numbers marked the second day in a row that the numbers were much lower than the outbreak's worst day on Saturday. Read more: Gov. Murphy: Coronavirus May 'Spill Meaningfully Into The Summer'

So you shouldn't be surprised when you see more money being taken out of your account once again this year.
Patch put together a list of all New Jersey towns and their average annual property tax bills, from highest to lowest. Patch also put together the percentage tax bill increases and decreases from 2018 to 2019 (see lists below).
You may be shocked when you see how expensive it's gotten to live in your town, especially compared to other towns nearby. Patch also put together lists that ranked the highest-to-lowest towns in each county (see county lists below).
At the same time, maybe you'll be pleased to see that property taxes actually rose at a much slower rate in 2019 than they did the year before.
The data, released this past week, comes from the state Department of Community Affairs. On average, the state's property taxes rose 2.12 percent, to $8,953, between 2018 and 2019. It was higher than the 2 percent cap former Gov. Chris Christie put into effect in 2011, according to the analysis.
By contrast, between 2017 and 2018, the average homeowner's tax bill rose to $8,767, an increase of less than 1 percent.
The Murphy Administration said the 2019 numbers revealed the third smallest two-year average statewide tax increase on record, which is well below historical five- and 10-year averages. The figures also show the smallest two-year property tax increase under any governor in their first two years in office, officials said.
The tax data tables also show that tax ratables rose 2.1 percent statewide since 2018, an increase above the five- and 10-year historical averages, with total ratables now at $1.09 trillion. The majority of municipalities in the state had average residential property tax decreases or increases under two percent.
""We're delivering on our promise to provide property tax stability while restoring New Jersey's fiscal standing and growing our economy,"" said Gov. Phil Murphy. ""Statewide property values have grown more in the first two years of my administration than at any point since the Great Recession. That's what we call progress.""

Acting Governor Oliver Sheila Oliver announced that Murphy underwent successful surgery and he's resting in a hospital in New York City. The surgery took place early Wednesday.
First Lady Tammy Murphy released a statement:
""I am proud to report that Phil's surgery presented no surprises to his doctors and was a success.
""The tumor was removed, and his left kidney remains largely intact. He is awake and (as expected) is in some discomfort, but he's gone through the entire day with his usual good humor and optimism buoying the nurses, doctors, staff and anyone else in his proximity - present company included! The kids and I are so happy to have him through surgery and now set our sights on healing.
""Home is not far from his mind, and one of his first questions (after asking how the surgery went and how the kids and I were holding up) was, ""Is everything ok in New Jersey?""
""Phil, the kids, and I cannot thank everyone enough for the tremendous outpouring of support we've received at this challenging time. We are so very grateful. And we know that Phil will jump back into the thick of things in no time!""
Murphy announced last week that he has a tumor on his kidney, and he scheduled the surgery to remove it. He learned that there is a 90 percent chance that it's cancer.
Murphy, 62, made the announcement on Twitter. ""The prognosis is very good and I'm profoundly grateful to my doctors for detecting the tumor early,"" Murphy said.
Murphy, who took office in January 2018, noted that more than 50,000 New Jerseyans will hear the words ""you have cancer"" this year, ""so I'm far from alone here.""
""It's a situation that far too many families find themselves in,"" he said. ""That's why we're fighting for them each and every day.""
Murphy then used the opportunity to discuss health care, saying it is ""a right, not a privilege for a select few, and skyrocketing medical costs are a national emergency.""
""If there's anything my diagnosis reminds me of, it's that preventative services are lifesaving and we need to continue fighting for affordable health care for all,"" he said.

15,/new-jersey/morristown/5-arrested-sweeping-nj-political-corruption-bust,2019-12-19T18:15:30Z,5 Officials In NJ Arrested In Corruption Bust,0,35,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY – Five people who have served as public officials or run as political candidates in New Jersey have been arrested in a sweeping corruption bust, Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced on Thursday.
Among their crimes: Envelopes and paper bags filled with cash – and even a coffee cup stuffed with cash – were delivered to the defendants by a cooperating witness at restaurants, parking lots, a political fundraiser and a campaign headquarters, according to the Office of Attorney General.
The five defendants were charged with taking thousands of dollars in bribes from the cooperating witness in the form of campaign contributions, all part of a ""major investigation"" into political corruption conducted by the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability, according to a release from the Office of Attorney Genenral..
The defendants allegedly promised the cooperating witness, who is a tax attorney, that they would vote or use their official authority or influence to hire or continue to hire his law firm for lucrative government legal work, according to the release.
The cooperating witness offered checks from illegal ""straw donors"" – individuals reimbursed to write checks to the defendant's campaign in amounts that complied with the legal limit on individual donations, according to the release.
The following five defendants were charged separately in criminal complaints with second-degree bribery in official and political matters:
The defendants who held public office at the time of the alleged conduct – Thomas, Cesaro and Windish – also are charged with second-degree acceptance or receipt of unlawful benefit by a public servant for official behavior, according to the release.
""We allege that these political candidates were all too willing to sell the authority of their public office or the office they sought in exchange for an envelope filled with cash or illegal checks from straw donors,"" said Grewal. ""This is old-school political corruption at its worst— the kind that undermines the political process and erodes public faith in government.""
The defendants were charged in an investigation by the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability which began in early 2018 and focused on political figures in Hudson and Morris counties who allegedly solicited illegal campaign contributions from the cooperating witness in return for promised official action to provide him with government work, according to the release.
As set forth in the complaints, the defendants are alleged to have engaged in the following conduct:
Sudhan Thomas
Incumbent Jersey City School Board President Sudhan Thomas, who was also was preparing to run for Jersey City councilman in 2021, is charged with accepting $35,000 in cash bribes, $10,000 delivered on one date and $25,000 delivered on a second date, the release said.
Thomas allegedly agreed, in return for the cash payments, to arrange for the cooperating witness to be hired as a special counsel for the Jersey City Board of Education. Thomas and the cooperating witness allegedly discussed specific work projects that the cooperating witness would receive from the board of education.
During a conversation about the cash payments before they were delivered, the cooperating witness and Thomas had the following exchange:
The alleged criminal conduct occurred between May and July 2019. Thomas lost his bid for re-election to the Jersey City School Board in November, and his term on the Board ends at the end of December.
Jason O'Donnell
Former state Assemblyman Jason O'Donnell, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Bayonne in 2018, is charged with accepting a $10,000 cash bribe. O'Donnell allegedly solicited $10,000 in ""street money"" for his mayoral campaign from the cooperating witness. In return, O'Donnell allegedly agreed to provide the cooperating witness with tax work from the City of Bayonne if elected mayor, the release said.
O'Donnell allegedly accepted a paper bag containing $10,000 in cash from the cooperating witness at his campaign headquarters, the release said. After the cash was handed over, they had the following exchange:
O'Donnell failed to file required campaign reports with the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission disclosing the $10,000 contribution. The alleged criminal conduct occurred between April and May 2018, the release said.
John Cesaro
Former Morris County Freeholder John Cesaro, who was a sitting county freeholder at the time of the alleged criminal conduct, solicited contributions from the cooperating witness for his 2021 campaign for mayor of Parsippany-Troy Hills, the release said.
Cesaro allegedly accepted bribes from the cooperating witness, in return for which he promised to secure more tax work from Morris County for the cooperating witness and make him tax counsel for Parsippany-Troy Hills if elected, the release said.
Cesaro allegedly accepted an envelope containing $10,000 in cash and $2,350 in checks from the cooperating witness, but later returned the cash, asking the cooperating witness to replace it with checks, the release said.
The two allegedly discussed using ""straw donors."" Under New Jersey election law, it is illegal for a person to provide money to another person, known as a ""straw donor,"" to make a political contribution to a specific candidate.
At a later fundraiser, Cesaro accepted two checks for $2,600 each – the individual limit for contributions per election per candidate – which the cooperating witness described as ""my straws,"" along with another check for $150 the release said.
During a conversation about the contributions before they were delivered, the cooperating witness and Cesaro allegedly had the following exchange:
The alleged criminal conduct occurred between April and May 2018.
John Windish
Former Mount Arlington Councilman John Windish allegedly accepted a $7,000 cash bribe. Windish allegedly solicited cash from the cooperating witness for his unsuccessful bid for re-election to borough council in June 2018. In return, Windish allegedly promised that he would support the reappointment of the cooperating witness as borough attorney.
Windish accepted an envelope containing $7,000 in cash from the cooperating witness, the release said. When the cash was delivered, they had the following conversation:
State election law prohibits cash contributions exceeding $200 from a single contributor for a single election. The alleged criminal conduct occurred in May 2018.
Mary Dougherty
Mary Dougherty, a real estate agent from Morristown and the wife of the Morristown mayor, allegedly accepted a bribe of $10,000 from the cooperating witness – initially delivered as cash but later converted to checks from ""straw donors"" – for her unsuccessful campaign for Morris County Freeholder in 2018, the release said.
In return, she allegedly promised to support the reappointment of the cooperating witness as counsel for Morris County. Dougherty also serves on the board of the Southeast Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority and is a past member of the Morristown Housing Authority.
During a meeting at a restaurant, Dougherty allegedly accepted $10,000 cash in $100 denominations that the cooperating witness delivered in a take-out coffee cup, the release said. Dougherty later returned the cash, asking the cooperating witness to replace the cash with four checks, each within the $2,600 individual contribution limit.
The cooperating witness told Dougherty he would use the returned $10,000 in cash to pay four individuals to write checks.
The pair met again at the same restaurant, where Dougherty accepted four checks, each in the amount of $2,500 payable to ""Mary for Morris Freeholder,"" the release said. When the checks were delivered, the cooperating witness and Dougherty had the following exchange:
The alleged criminal conduct occurred between August and October 2018.
Second-degree crimes carry a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $150,000. The second-degree charges against those who held public office at the time of the alleged conduct – Thomas, Cesaro, and Windish – carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison without eligibility for parole under New Jersey's enhanced penalties for official corruption."

Sherrill Will Vote In Favor Of Impeachment,0,7,Russ Crespolini,Patch Staff,"MORRISTOWN, NJ - Military veteran and U.S. Representative Mikie Sherrill, who represents New Jersey's 11th District, said she intends to vote in favor of the Articles of Impeachment being levied against President Trump.
Sherrill, freshman Democrat, called the Trump's actions a violation of the principles the country was founded upon, saying that he used his office for personal gain.
Her complete statement is below.
""I have served this country most of my life, both in uniform and out, here at home and abroad, in wartime and in peace. I have been honored to enter into service once again in the United States House of Representatives.
My military service taught me to put our country — not politics — first, and my time as a federal prosecutor taught me about the importance of the rule of law and of justice.
On Wednesday, as a member of the House, I will be called upon to vote on Articles of Impeachment. After reviewing the testimony and the statements of the President himself, it is clear that he used his office for his own personal gain. He withheld critical military aid in an effort to coerce Ukraine, a security partner, to investigate an opponent of his in the 2020 elections. Furthermore, he used every opportunity to place himself and the executive branch above the law by refusing all congressional subpoenas.
In short, the President has violated the very principles upon which our country was founded. He put his own political interests before our country, and has disregarded the rule of law and the powers granted to Congress by our Founding Fathers. I believe these actions undermine the values of our country, the ideals I have sworn to protect, and our Constitution. Therefore, I will be voting in favor of the Articles of Impeachment.""
Back in October, Sherrill also voted to approve eight pages of procedures to take the impeachment inquiry against President Trump to nationally broadcast public hearings.

18,/new-jersey/morristown/roll-back-15-nj-minimum-wage-law-delayed-whats-next,2019-11-14T18:23:20Z,Roll-Back Of $15 NJ Minimum Wage Law Is Delayed,0,42,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY – Plans to roll back New Jersey's $15 minimum wage law have been postponed, but lawmakers say they're ready to revisit the issue soon.
Sen. Vin Gopal, D-Monmouth, under pressure from fellow Democrats, said he was pulling the roll-back legislation that the state Senate Labor Committee had scheduled for a vote on Thursday.
The legislation would have allowed the planned minimum wage increases to be delayed based on decreases in employment, retail sales and tax receipts.
Gopal, however, said he is not giving up on the legislation that New Jersey's business community had pushed for, fearing that gradually increasing the state's minimum wage to $15 by 2024 could harm small businesses and hurt the state's economy.
""I look forward to meeting with stakeholders in the weeks and months ahead on the positives and negatives,"" said Gopal, who co-sponsored the legislation with Sen. Kristin Corrado, R-Passaic.
Democrats such as U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, had pushed for a delay in voting on the bill.
""This is an irresponsible proposal that will harm both workers and businesses,"" he said. ""This proposal should be rejected by the Senate Labor Committee on Thursday and I'm calling on all New Jerseyans to make their voices heard today. It's ($15 minimum wage) good for the economy, it's right for workers, people support it and you promised to do it: Raise the Wage.""
Democrats also agued that they already approved several safeguards to lessen the impact on small businesses when Gov. Phil Murphy signed the minimum wage bill into law in February, including a gradual roll-in of wage increases.
The law increased the minimum-wage base for New Jersey workers to $10 an hour on July 1. By Jan. 1, 2020, the statewide minimum wage will increase to $11-an-hour, and then will increase by $1-an-hour every January 1st until it reaches $15 an hour on January 1, 2024.
Other safeguards, Democrats say, included:
Gopal's legislation also would have suspended the scheduled minimum wage if the state's tax revenue decreased by at least 2 percent from the preceding fiscal year.
Gopal had earlier introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $12 over three years and draft a state study to determine its impact on small business owners.
The bill would have set an initial minimum wage increase to $10.10 as of 2019. The bill would then increase the minimum wage as much as $1.25 in both 2020 and 2021, culminating in a $12 minimum wage.
The bill also provided for a number of exemptions designed to support local and seasonal businesses and requires annual economic studies to be conducted to evaluate the impact of the minimum wage increase over a 5-year period, he said.
""We must also consider the constraints on small and seasonal businesses who often rely on minimum wage workers. Our local mom and pop shops will not be able to afford the short-term $15 minimum wage that some of my colleagues are pushing for,"" he said earlier this year."
19,/new-jersey/morristown/morristown-man-awarded-presidential-medal-9-11-heroism,2019-11-08T19:24:34Z,Man Awarded Presidential Medal For 9/11 Heroism,0,1,Katie Kausch ,Patch Staff,"MORRISTOWN, NJ — A Morristown veteran killed while ushering others out of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Donald Trump in a Thursday evening ceremony.
The medal was given to Retired Army Colonel Rick Rescorla's family during a ceremony honoring in the White House, just days ahead of Veteran's Day. His wife, Susan, and two of his children, Trevor and Kim, were in attendance at the ceremony.
""Our debt to you is beyond measure. We can never reverse the horrors of that day. We can never replace the precious lives we lost. But on behalf of our entire nation, I pledge that we will forever and always remember this incredible American hero, Colonel Rick Rescorla. We will never, ever forget,"" Trump said, speaking to Rescorla's family.
Susan Rescorla said in an acceptance speech that her late husband was a man of character from the day they met.
""On our first date, he said to me, 'What are you about?' And I said, 'What do you mean, Rick?' And he said, 'Well, when I was a very young man, I declared what I wanted to be. And I knew that if I stayed on that path, that at the end of my life, that I would have done the very best that I could.' And that's exactly what Rick did,"" Rescorla said. (You can read the full text of both Trump and Recorla's speeches here.)
Eighteen years ago, Rescorla was working as the vice president for corporate security at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., on the 44th floor of the south tower. Seemingly anticipating the second strike, he made the decision to ignore messages from the Port Authority to stay put in the south tower, and instead began evacuating his employees, the Army said.
""The dumb sons of bitches told me not to evacuate. They said it's just Building One. I told them I'm getting my people the [expletive] out of here,"" Rescorla reportedly said on a call to his best friend.
He kept helping people out of the buildings even after the south tower was struck. Before heading back in to the building, Rescorla called his wife and told her, ""Stop crying, I have to get these people out safely. If something happens to me, I want you to know I've never been happier. You made my life.""
He was last seen going back into the building to rescue more people, when a coworker told him to stop heading back in and to evacuate.
""As soon I make sure everyone else is out,"" was his response.
Rescorla was killed in the south tower's collapse.
Rescorla's actions saved thousands of lives. On a day when companies lost unspeakable numbers of people, Morgan Stanely lost just six of their 2,700 World Trade Center employees.
Even before giving his life on 9/11, Rescorla lead a life of bravery. He served as a British paratrooper during the Cyprus Emergency, and was a commissioned officer in the American Army during the Vietman War. He was awarded a Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Gallantry Cross, and the Combat Infantry Man in recognition of his service.
The Presidential Citizens Medal is the second highest award a civilian can be awarded, second only to the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
20,/new-jersey/morristown/murphy-signs-3-nj-bills-law-may-borrow-9b-amid-coronavirus,2020-07-17T13:36:48Z,"Murphy Signs 3 NJ Bills Into Law, May Borrow ...",2,171,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEWS JERSEY – Gov. Phil Murphy signed the New Jersey COVID-19 Emergency Bond Act into law on Thursday, allowing the Garden State to borrow up to $9.9 billion to address what lawmakers are calling ""the unprecedented fiscal crisis"" that's a consequence of the coronavirus crisis. The act was one of three Murphy signed to assist New Jersey amid the pandemic.
Under the law, the state has the authority to issue bonds totaling $2.7 billion for the remainder of the extended Fiscal Year 2020, which runs through Sept. 30. Murphy, however, has not ruled out pushing for a tax increase to also make up for the shortfall in revenues that's happened as a result of shutting down the economy.
The economic downturn may continue since parts of the state's business industry, including indoor dining, still remain shut. Read more: NJ Coronavirus, Reopen Updates: Here's What You Need To Know
The law also allows the state issue up to an additional $7.2 billion for the nine-month Fiscal Year 2021 that runs from Oct. 1 through June 30, 2021, for a combined amount of up to $9.9 billion to be issued over the two periods.
""The passage of this legislation is an important step in New Jersey's recovery from the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Murphy said. ""While this is by no means a silver bullet, the ability to responsibly borrow is essential to meeting our fiscal needs in the coming year.""
Republicans, however, say they're suing to stop ""his ill-advised and unconstitutional borrowing.""
State Sen. Joe Pennacchio said ""it is the definition of insanity"" to ""blindly approve"" borrowing $9.9 billion when the executive branch ""has not even proposed a budget yet for next year and we have no clue how much we will actually need.""
""The governor's borrowing scheme includes $2.7 billion to fund shortfalls that he says exists in the current fiscal year. That frankly does not make any sense,"" Pennacchio said. ""He recently signed a balanced budget extension bill that will get our state through the end of the fiscal year in September, claiming we'll end the year with a $1 billion surplus.""
The state is authorized to borrow either through the issuance of general obligation bonds that can be sold to investors, or through the federal government's Municipal Liquidity Facility.
That latter entity was established to help states and local governments across the country deal with the fallout from the global pandemic. The state is also authorized to refinance bonds issued pursuant to the bond act.
Debt service on this bond issuance will be repaid through the state's General Fund.
Murphy stressed that the state plans to borrow only what is necessary to speed New Jersey's recovery from this unparalleled recession.
""The current economic crisis is virtually unprecedented in both its severity and swiftness,"" said Murphy. ""Our unemployment numbers and drop in revenue have both far outpaced the worst months of the Great Recession so while we see this bill as an important step, our ultimate recovery will depend on a number of factors including additional federal aid and savings within state government.""
The bill was sponsored by Democratic Senate President Steve Sweeney and Sen. Paul Sarlo in the Senate and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin and Assemblyman John McKeon in the Assembly.
""This will give us the ability to provide the resources needed to respond to crisis economic conditions resulting from the coronavirus,"" said Senate President Steve Sweeney. ""It also includes a process to ensure responsibility in managing public finances as we work through the fiscal problems that are not fully known. We want to be responsive to financial needs, but we also have to be fiscally responsible and recognize the long-term consequences of actions we take.""
Murphy also signed these bills into law:"

At multiple points over the last few months Governor Phil Murphy has spoken about the importance of an accurate census at his daily coronavirus briefings, highlighting that all nine million Garden State residents need to be accurately counted.
""In 2010 New Jersey left untold billions of dollars in federal aid on the table, "" he said, noting that both federal and state governments use that data to make financial decisions on aid.
""If that money isn't coming to New Jersey, it's going to some other state,"" Murphy said.
New Jersey's overall self-response rate stood at 64 percent as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Census database. The national response rate was 62 percent.
The U.S. Census counts every resident in the United States. It's mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and takes place every 10 years.
The census is important for several reasons, officials say. Here are a few, according to census.gov:

Locally, there are no elections in Morristown in the primary.
The results are expected to be delayed as the deadline for the County Clerk has been extended by a week. And the vote-by-mail option has many concerned about making sure their vote counts.
But for those voters who have concerns, they can track their vote from drop box or mail-box, straight to their County Clerk's Office. Those interested can do so by creating a personalized voter account online.
""Our goals are twofold,"" Gov. Phil Murphy said when he changed the primary back in May. ""To maximize our democracy while minimizing the risk of illness. We want everyone to participate in a safe, fully democratic process.""
Murphy also said that there will be polling places open in every municipality to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to vote and at least 50 percent of the normal locations per county.
Murphy added that voters who have not been able to seamlessly transition to a mail-in process, like those with a disability, will be kept safe when they cast their vote.
""Social distancing protocols will be enforced within these polling locations,"" he said.
All registered Democratic and Republican voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail ballot while all unaffiliated and inactive voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail application. Those ballots can be sent back by mail or dropped in one of the boxes.

The drop boxes will be monitored, security camera surveillance, and will have daily pickups by the County Board of Elections.
Another key change will be the voting deadline. While all the ballots must still be postmarked by the July 7 election day, Murphy said that the deadline which votes must be received by a county board of elections – to be counted as valid – will be extended from 48 hours after the polls close to seven days after the polls close.
""We expect a greater than normal vote-by-mail turnout the deadline,"" he said. ""And we will ensure that every vote is counted.""

The drop boxes will be monitored, security camera surveillance, and will have daily pickups by the County Board of Elections.
Another key change will be the voting deadline. While all the ballots must still be postmarked by the July 7 election day, Murphy said that the deadline which votes must be received by a county board of elections – to be counted as valid – will be extended from 48 hours after the polls close to seven days after the polls close.
""We expect a greater than normal vote-by-mail turnout the deadline,"" he said. ""And we will ensure that every vote is counted.""

""Our goals are twofold,"" Gov. Phil Murphy said when he made the announcement in May. ""To maximize our democracy while minimizing the risk of illness. We want everyone to participate in a safe, fully democratic process.""
Murphy also said that there will be polling places open in every municipality to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to vote and at least 50 percent of the normal locations per county.
Murphy added that voters who have not been able to seamlessly transition to a mail-in process, like those with a disability, will be kept safe when they cast their vote.
""Social distancing protocols will be enforced within these polling locations including the sanitizing of every touch screen, voting machine in between voters,"" he said.
All registered Democratic and Republican voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail ballot while all unaffiliated and inactive voters will automatically receive a postage paid vote-by-mail application. Those ballots can be sent back by mail or dropped in one of the boxes.

But just this week, in contravention of the Constitution and all historical precedent, President Trump issued a Memorandum directing that undocumented immigrants -- described as ""aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status""-- be excluded from the census totals that will be reported to Congress for purposes of House seat apportionment.
Filed in U.S. District Court in New York, the lawsuit joined by Attorney General Grewal alleges that the President's decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the totals is likely to:
By discouraging immigrants from responding to the 2020 census, the complaint contends, the President's decision also will degrade the overall accuracy of the census data.
The complaint further asserts that Trump's order is directly related to his Administration's failed attempt to have a citizenship question included on the 2020 census, is designed to punish states, like New Jersey, that have declined to cooperate with the President's immigration enforcement efforts, and ""is motivated by discriminatory animus toward Hispanics and immigrant communities of color.""

Phil Murphy this week includes millions in cuts to county Child Advocacy Centers, who say abuse cases across the state are increasing.
""It really is the perfect storm,"" said Maria Vinci Savettiere, executive director of Deidre's House, a Child Advocacy Center in Morristown whose funding was cut. ""Our referrals are going through the roof, and now we have no money from the state.""
Savettiere said $4.5 million previously designated to be split between the 21 centers in the state has been slashed from the budget. She added that cases are rising in the state because children who were isolating with their abusers now can leave the house and disclose to others.
""This is really the worst time to cut services to children,"" Savettiere said. ""I realize the state is in a terrible budget shortfall, but we're talking about a drop in the bucket.""
Deirdre's House is designated one of 21 Child Advocacy Centers in New Jersey. The facility provides free medical exams, forensic interviewing, clinical counseling, and other services to abused and neglected children in Morris County.
Savettiere said the governor's office told her the funding was cut because the money, which was initially set aside by the Christie administration, was intended to go only towards the construction of advocacy centers. Savettiere disagreed, and said the money should have been shifted to paying for services to the community. The governor's office did not return a request for comment on Wednesday.
Regardless of the reason, Savettiere said the cuts will cause major problems for Deirdre's House, which saw its federal funding disappear last year. Compounding the issue is the extra costs incurred during the pandemic for telehealth programs. Savettiere said one of her staff will need to be let go, but others could follow.
""It's the last thing I want to do,"" she said, ""but I have no choice if this happens."""

On Saturday at approximately 1:00 p.m., an F-15 fighter jet and Coast Guard helicopter responded to northwestern Somerset County when a single-engine plane violated the restricted airspace near Trump National Golf Club, where the president was spending the weekend.
The military aircraft established radio contact with the pilot and then followed it to an airport in Pennsylvania. According to Lehigh Valley Live, the plane was piloted by a couple flying to New Jersey to hike.
""The President was not in danger and the security of the complex was maintained throughout,"" said a statement by the U.S. Secret Service. ""Further investigation of the airspace violation is pending.""
No charges have been filed in connection with the incident. This is the second time in less than a month that fighters have responded to the Bedminster area. On July 25, another small craft strayed into the restricted airspace while Trump was staying at the club and was escorted to northern New Jersey by an F-15.
Trump has frequented his Bedminster property during the summer months of his presidency, including annual vacations in August. The president has spent 99 days in Bedminster since being sworn in, second only to Mar-a-Lago's 133 days, according to NBC News.

The problems began when the council meeting started late, after another conference ran over time. Members of the public who tried to log into the meeting were told they could not.
""Our council meeting started late,"" said town administrator Jillian Barrick ""Our ABC hearing was still going on, so when anyone tried to log in at 7:30, they got a message that they could not join.""
But soon after, during the public hearing portion of the meeting, the feed logged out for approximately 20 minutes. A Zoom link mix up with the previous meeting was said to be the cause.
Mayor Tim Dougherty's report reviewed the start of indoor dining and noted that Morristown's coronavirus numbers have leveled out to where the town hasn't had a new case in nearly one week.
""It's really good,"" Dougherty said, ""people are doing what they're supposed to be doing, wearing masks. People are keeping their distance, and hygiene is key.""
Sandi Mayer, 4th Ward councilwoman, reported vandalism of trees in ward as part of the Shade Tree Commission report.
""There's holes being drilled into the trees and something is being poured into them,"" Mayer said, ""probably trying to ruin the trees and get rid of them.""
Mayer said a tree on Cleveland Street was recently vandalized, its bark sawed off and copper nails nailed into it.
""Hopefully the residents will step up in that neighborhood and put a stop to that vandalism,"" the councilwoman said.

Name: Meredith Davidson
During my 3 year tenure on the Morris School District School Board, I believe we've made immense progress. I've been laser focused on communication and collaboration with parents and the community, boosting achievement across the board, supporting staff, and funding programs that work. But there is more work to be done. I will continue to work hard to ensure the positive and balanced experience of all students and stakeholders in our educational system. I sincerely want to thank the community for remaining so engaged and for what we have achieved together.
I have served on the Morris School District School Board for 3 years and been a parent volunteer in our schools for 4 years before that, but my passionate involvement in education pre-dates my time in the Morristown schools; it includes community organizing, working as a teacher, and working with students on college and career awareness. All of my educational and community experience has made me a better advocate in and out of the classroom and the boardroom. The Morristown community has energized me to the greatness all our kids can achieve. We're starting from a good place, but I have shown a true commitment to support our schools in going from good to great.
The most important challenge we face is how to help ALL children reach their potential while using the resources we currently have. Here in the Morris School District, we need to continue to give all students access to a rigorous and competitive school experience. Throughout our country, the opportunity gap has led to sizable differences in achievement between students from different racial and socioeconomic groups. We are beginning to make progress but we must persevere in closing this gap. I will continue to advocate for research-based resources and training to help teachers reach all students. I will support policies and programs that encourage systematic collaboration between administrators, parents, students and the community. I will work to streamline and strengthen district goals backed by results driven initiatives to build stronger schools and a stronger community.
Student achievement is at the heart of what drives our school board. I think we need to partner with families in sustainable ways so that our community is what drives our schools to become stronger. We can do this for academic programming so that families know how to support their children at home. We can also continue to support our outstanding athletic, arts and extracurricular programming to achieve 100% student participation. Research and my own experience shows that students are most engaged and most successful when they are passionate about and involved in school activities outside of just academics.
The Morris School District is incredibly unique and resilient. Through the hard work of our teachers, administrators and school board members, we've had extraordinary accomplishments. But there is more work to be done. I will continue to work hard to push for academic achievement across all student groups, advocate for communication and collaboration so that students and families feel welcome and engaged in our schools, and keep listening to and working with students, families and community members to make our schools and community strong.

Name: Oliver M. Starnes
1. Why are you running for the board of education seat?
I am running to represent Morristown on the Morris School District Board of Education to ""Be
the Change"" I wish to see within our community, county, state, and in due time—the whole
country. I took part in a 10-week human rights advocacy campaign this summer acclaimed for its
peaceful protest marches and 'teach-in' race dialogues, but its most impactful takeaway went
largely unnoticed. As COVID-19 compelled most school boards to host meetings virtually (i.e.,
via Zoom) it also catalyzed attendance between Gen Zs and Millennials. While I am incredibly
grateful for MSD BOE and its positioning on the landscape of Morris County public school
districts, I believe there is a considerable amount of work yet to be accomplished.
2. What makes you qualified for the position?
I am qualified and prepared for this position thanks to a variety of life stages. As a lifelong
resident of Morris County, I graduated from a public-school district prior to leaving for Trinity
College in Hartford, CT. As a student-athlete from the 5th grade through college I have a strong
understand for the importance of teamwork, which translates directly to being one of 10 school
board members. In aspiring to emulate my mother's 30-year career in public service with the
Department of Defense, I came home from college with degrees in Political Science and Public
Policy. From 2014 to date, I have been interning, networking, and organizing my local
community. Despite my personal and professional qualifications, I am constantly seeking to
learn and improve all aspects of serving the public.
3. What is the most pressing issue facing the school district and what will you do about
it?
COVID-19 is the most pressing issue facing the Morris School District. The first step to address
both immediate and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis would be fostering a
communication portal between students, parents, faculty, staff, and residents that provide all
stakeholders with identical information. Secondly, I would conduct a full inventory of available
resources (financial, technical, etc.) originating from the County, State, and Federal levels of
government. Lastly, I would secure a direct point of contact at each level of government
responsible for maintaining effective lines of communication to ensure regular dialogue is held
between both elected officials and public administrators.
4. What are some other issues you want to see addressed?
Outside of COVID-19, the most important challenge faced by the Morris School District Board
of Education is major population growth. On January 16, 2020, the Morris County Planning
Board presented a report on 'Demographic and Economic Trends', which named Morristown as
one of a half dozen municipalities that experienced major population growth from 2010 to 2018.
As of July 1, 2019, data showed Morristown's population increased by 5% since the last Census.
If elected, I would utilize results from the 2020 Census to better inform which measures are
taken to properly meet the needs of an expanded population of school-aged residents. Achieving
curriculum coherency with the Morris Plains School District (MPSD) is another important
challenge facing the MSD. If elected, I would like to play a key role in collaborating with MPSD
Board Members on its pre-kindergarten through eighth grade curriculum to ensure students are
fully prepared to matriculate through a high school that serves three distinct communities. Lastly,
I wish to mitigate stagnant achievement gaps among students of color by fostering parent groups.
5. What do you hope to be your overall impact on the BOE if you are elected?
In the short-term, I hope to bring immediate impacts to the curriculum and policy sectors of
Morris School District. If I am elected, I hope to bring a new voice and thoughtful perspective to
the decision making process for one of the best public school districts in Morris County.

Name: Dr. Vivian Rodriguez
1. Why are you running for the Board of Education?
I am running for the Board of Education for the following reasons:
1. Choices have Power
2. We must Chase equity for Children
3. We must cultivate possibilities for all children
Since an early age , I have noticed that the choices that I make in life have the power to change many things. It was my choice to further my education that helped me contribute to the field. It was my choice to have a family that has blessed me with two wonderful daughters and grandchildren that fill my life today with joy and happiness. I believe that in education, the choices we make should all be driven towards chasing equity for children. It is our collective responsibility to cultivate possibilities for all children, regardless of disability, language, or background; so that they may have good choices to make in their educational futures.
After a 39-year career in education , I will be able to contribute, if elected to the Morris Board of Education, in cultivating possibilities and positive choices for our students.
2. What makes you qualified for this position?
I believe that I am qualified for the position of board member of the Morris School Board of Education for the following reasons:
1. 30 years of Administrative experience in NJ Public schools, including 19 years as Assistant Superintendent of Schools, 1 year as Acting Superintendent of School , 2 years as Acting Associate Dean of the College of Education at Kean University.
2. 17 years of teaching experience at the elementary and college level
3. Served as Board and Trustee member, including 9 years as a Trustee at Kean University.
In addition, I have worked closely with Board members for 19 years as Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Curriculum and Instruction, attending all board and committee meetings.
But most of all, I am trustworthy, hard working, and enjoy working with people to advocate for children.
3. What is the most pressing issue facing the school district and what would you do about it?
The most important challenge facing our district today is to be able to re-envision our school district and determine what education will look like in the presence of COVID-19. As a Board of Education member I would take the following steps:
1. Examine all policies to safeguard the health, safety, instructional standards, finances of our district.
2. Review 2020-2021 School budget
3. Review disaggregated district data for student achievement for all grades
4. To work with the superintendent, Board of Education, and community stakeholders to continue a real-time communication system.
4. What are some other issues you want to see addressed?
When the conversation allows, and at the proper time; I would like to speak to the superintendent and the Board about some successes I have had in the area of Biliteracy. I would like to speak to our community about Dual Language Programs and how it can benefit ALL children.
5. What do you hope to be your overall impact on the BOE if you are elected?
My overall impact if elected will be to be a Board member that understands the State Department of Education mandates, how a school system works, and the role of a Board of Education member.

Name: Elisabeth Wall
1. Why are you running for the board of education seat?
For me, running for the Morris School District Board of Education was the natural next step in my journey of service to this town. Born and raised in Morris County, I have been working, volunteering and living in Morristown, or some combination of the three, for nearly 20 years. Over the last two decades I have devoted my time to serving our community, as both a volunteer and a leader. As a member for 16 years, my volunteer roots are embedded in the Junior League of Morristown, an exclusively educational and charitable organization of inspiring women committed to volunteerism, developing the potential of women, and improving communities through effective action and leadership. For the last four years, I was president of the Washington's Headquarters Neighborhood Association, a not-for-profit organization established for the purpose of creating community spirit, fostering interest in civic affairs, and furthering the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Washington's Headquarters area of Morristown and Morris Township. Almost two years ago, I was appointed by the Town Council to sit on the Morristown Zoning Board of Adjustment. As a board member, I volunteer my time hearing appeals, interpreting provisions of the zoning ordinance, and making decisions on applications to permit buildings or land uses that vary from the state and local zoning regulations.
However, nearest and dearest to my heart, and my primary motivation to become a member of the Morris School District Board of Education, is my son, Braden, who is now a first grader at Normandy Park School. There was never any question in my mind that I would be an active participant in his schooling. From volunteering as preschool class parent to now serving as Treasurer of the Normandy Park Home and School Association (HSA), I've so enjoyed supporting his educational experience over the last few years. And while the role of this office is to serve each and every child in the school district, not just my own, I believe it is important for the community to understand that I have a personal long-term interest in ensuring that every child receives the best possible educational experience—socially, emotionally, and academically—that our community can provide. In my opinion, that in and of itself, makes me especially suited for this role.
2. What makes you qualified for the position?
I think that my career as an attorney, my experience as a leader and volunteer in the community over the last twenty years and my long-term interest in the educational experience of every child in our district, including my own, make me ideally suited to serve on the Morris School District Board of Education. What is more is that my love of Morristown and connection to this community over the years runs long and deep. I never miss an opportunity to get involved, to support and most importantly, to listen.
3. What is the most pressing issue facing the school district and what will you do about it?
I think it goes without saying that the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on our school district are, and will remain, a priority for the foreseeable future. I believe that in the midst of this crisis we must provide students exceptional learning experiences in a safe, healthy and inclusive environment. We must continue to align with the New Jersey Department of Education, recommendations from the CDC, and the current state and local public health information. We must continue to seek input and feedback from parents, faculty, staff and other community stakeholders. It is critical that we remain diligent in providing communication that is honest, thorough, and transparent. We must also remain flexible as shifts in local, state, and national conditions develop and require us to pivot yet again. Finally, we must ensure ample resources are provided (now and for months, and years to come) throughout the district to combat the lasting impact of COVID-19 on our children's mental health, as well as their emotional and behavioral development.
We are living through extraordinary times as a result of COVID-19, an illness that has rocked the social, economic, and emotional foundations of our community and the world. I am acutely aware that not all students and their families have been effected in the same way. I want to ensure that we keep that at the forefront of our minds as we continue to navigate these uncharted waters to ensure that all students are receiving what they need to ascend.
Another priority for our district is to address systemic racism in our schools. Of course, we must not abandon the important work that is already being done by way of the MSD Equity and Inclusion Action Plan in order to create a more equitable and inclusive learning community for each of our students. It remains critical that we provide culturally relevant learning experiences and instruction; hire exceptional educators from diverse backgrounds and perspectives; offer annual professional training that fosters a more inclusive and equitable learning community; strengthen district and community relationships; and promote the success of each student by ensuring equal opportunity and access to positive and diverse relationships. However, as our Superintendent has recently acknowledged, this is not enough and that we must confront racism in our schools head on; it simply cannot wait. As first steps, I want to be a part of creating meaningful community alliances and seeking input from our BIPOC students and educators in order that we may develop a comprehensive Antiracism Policy. Upholding equality and social justice in our school district is essential and we must constantly explore positive and effective ways to do so.
4. What are some other issues you want to see addressed?
I believe there are and will always be issues facing our school district, and not one of them is necessarily more important than the other. Rather, certain issues may need to take priority based on the situation, but all must be monitored closely and reprioritized when necessary. That said, presently the two issues mentioned above are two that I would like to remain priorities. In addition, I am always interested in keeping a close eye on the issues of school safety, student mental health, vaping, substance abuse and bullying.
5. What do you hope to be your overall impact on the BOE if you are elected?
As a parent who is new to the Morris School District, I sincerely appreciate how our current board, superintendent and administration have worked cooperatively and effectively to manage our schools, especially during this time of extraordinary challenges. No system is perfect, evolution is necessary and I would like nothing more than to join this dedicated team so that I may continue their admirable work, as well as add value in the best way that I can. I believe that we need leaders on our school board who are deeply vested in our children and their educational experience, as well as someone committed to understanding what is going on both within our schools and out in our entire community. I believe that I am that leader. I also sincerely believe that an inquisitive, collaborative and independent voice is absolutely in the best interest of our children.

The coronavirus pandemic has increased interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy in August ordered vote-by-mail ballots to be sent to all active voters. Those ballots were in the mail as of Monday.
Because of the surge in vote-by-mail balloting in our area and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year. Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in the 2016 election, working with ProPublica to bring you information on broken scanners and long lines at the polls in Brooklyn, the extension of voting hours in Durham County, North Carolina, due to technical issues, voting improprieties in Texas, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and much more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:"

Phil Murphy is set to sign a massive, $14 billion corporate tax-break bill into law that's supposed to give New Jersey a big boost amid the COVID-19 crisis.
The more than 100-page New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 — introduced last Wednesday — received criticism for its limited public testimony. But Murphy defended the proposal in Monday's coronavirus news conference, saying the bill would update economic-development incentive programs that expired more than a year ago.
It would also enact new programs for endeavors such as historic preservation and brownfield remediation.
Murphy may address the bill during a 1 p.m. news conference on Wednesday. Patch will cover it live. Read more: WATCH LIVE: Gov. Murphy Issues NJ Coronavirus, Closures Update
""The principles that underpin this incentives package have been out there for two years,"" Murphy said. ""The more that people look at this…it gets better on close inspection.""
The Assembly passed the Economic Recovery Act by a 68-11 margin before the Senate voted 38-1 in its favor (see the bill's details below).
It wasn't immediately clear how lawmakers will pay for the initiatives.
Sen. Paul Sarlo, D-Bergen, said this legislation provides more than $14 billion in tax incentives over seven years that will need to spur business and job growth ""as we come out of a pandemic crisis that has devastated broad sectors of our economy.""
""Most importantly, this legislation will provide tax incentives to attract the jobs we want – jobs that pay high salaries in cutting edge industries that will transform communities, partner with our higher education sector on research and development, provide valuable job training and be good corporate citizens,"" he said.
Business-lobbying groups have urged Murphy to restore state incentive programs since they lapsed in 2019.
Christopher Emigholz, vice president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, said the legislation meets four of the five prongs that NJBIA asserts to improve New Jersey's economy: affordability, innovation, workforce development and infrastructure.
He also said there are some weaknesses in the bill as it relates to regulatory burdens and mandates that might offset the positives designed to attract and retain businesses.
""NJBIA has been asking for more balance and an economic plan reflecting that throughout the economic struggles of this pandemic, and we believe this bill represents that balanced plan,"" Emigholz said.
""It is impossible to know if this economic development plan will achieve the right balance, but we ask the Legislature for a chance to revisit this balance in the future as we learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of this bill. We do appreciate that this plan does not continue the unrelenting tax increases, cost drivers and regulatory burdens that we have seen over the course of the pandemic instead providing new supports to an economy on the brink.""
Lawmakers say the legislation would establish economic development programs to incentivize:
The bill would also amend the existing statute to expand the availability of tax incentives for certain wind projects (Offshore Wind Economic Development Act) and certain film projects (Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program).
It would further establish a working group on entrepreneur zones and address the procurement and manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE).
Here's a closer look at what's in the bill:
Tax-breaks
The bill would effectively restore two expired incentive programs that existed to encourage job creation and redevelopment projects. The measure would also establish new programs to incentivize economic-development efforts.
More specific tax breaks include those for historic preservation, brownstone remediation and eliminating food deserts. The bill would also establish a public-private venture-capital fund for investment in startups and emerging businesses in New Jersey.
Caps
The bill establishes new caps covering seven different programs the bill creates. For instance, the legislation caps some programs through how much a region can receive in an effort to ensure equitable geographic distribution of tax breaks.
The bill would allow for up to $1.5 billion in tax breaks to get rewarded over six years. But if the total rewarded value doesn't hit the proposed program caps in its first six years, it could get extended another year. But overall, tax breaks would get capped to $11.5 billion.
The total price tag of $14 billion counts the changes to the film-tax credit program and other additions lawmakers approved.
Watchdogs
The bill calls for changes to improve government oversight on tax breaks. This would include adding an inspector general position to the Economic Development Authority and upgrading the net-benefit test for tax-incentivized projects.
Companies and executives would have to certify under penalty of perjury that they're telling the truth in tax-break applications."

46,/new-jersey/morristown/protest-against-gov-murphys-covid-rules-set-morristown,2020-11-20T18:39:24Z,Protest Against Gov. Murphy's COVID Rules Set...,0,21,Josh Bakan,Patch Staff,"MORRISTOWN, NJ — We the People NJ — a new organization whose spokesperson and legal counsel is Morris County Surrogate Heather Darling — will lead a protest Sunday in Morristown against some of Gov. Phil Murphy's coronavirus restrictions. The ""March for Your Rights"" will begin at Morris Township Police Department and move to Morristown Town Hall by noon.
We the People NJ started recently in hopes to advocate for New Jerseyans' ""right to choose personal safety and responsibility in the face of Covid-19 rather than lockdowns,"" according to its mission statement.
The organization told all attendees to wear masks and practice social distancing, because they don't want their marches to be ""super spreader"" events.
New Jersey has hit a second wave of the pandemic, according to state health officials. As a result, Murphy has implemented several restrictions in November alone.
Murphy announced last week that bars and restaurants could no longer serve customers indoors from 10 p.m. through 5 a.m., while indoor capacity during allowable hours remains at 25 percent.
He also imposed new restrictions for gatherings with the holidays approaching, limiting crowds to 10 people indoors and 150 people outdoors.
We the People NJ will hold their event Sunday, because that's the last day crowds of 500 can gather in New Jersey. However, the state has allowed ""First Amendment gatherings"" such as protests to religious services to exceed outdoor limits.
But the state's current coronavirus restrictions put many businesses at risk of closure, according to Darling.
""What these people are asking for is it have their rights under the Constitution upheld for the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness and putting reasonable restrictions on operations of businesses,"" Darling said. ""But not the closure of businesses, not these enhanced lockdowns that everybody seems to be afraid of.""
Darling runs a small real-estate business and says pandemic restrictions have hurt her industry because of the lack of mortgage relief. Although New Jersey hasn't imposed universal rent forgiveness, Murphy has prohibited landlords from removing tenants until two months after the state of emergency ends.
Darling also serves as Morris County's surrogate, an elected position. She said there is no issue with her dual roles as surrogate and representing the protesting group.
""I'm doing this outside of my hour's in the surrogate's court, because one has absolutely nothing to do with the other,"" she said.
Darling is speaking on the group's behalf, because We the People NJ members with to remain anonymous.
""Members of the group wish to remain anonymous in light of public threats by at least one elected official, AOC (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), against private citizens whose opinions differ from those of the electeds.""
Asked which public threat(s) she's referencing, Darling said the following:
""It was a recent famous AOC tweet that a lot of citizens were concerned about concerning compiling lists of people. I have no further comment on that for myself or as a representative of the group.""

""I requested mail-in ballots from New Jersey on three separate occasions because they repeatedly weren't arriving to my Baltimore address,"" Matalon told Patch. ""Until yesterday [Election Day]. They all miraculously arrived only after polls have closed, making it impossible to put any of them to use. These ballots were postmarked in mid-October, all on different days, yet didn't reach me in Baltimore until after the election.""
Patch contacted the U.S. Postal Service, and a New Jersey spokesperson said they reached out to Baltimore and are still researching what may have affected the mail delivery.
In the photo provided to Patch, the three ballots have three different postmarks, dating back to the beginning of October.
""I've been going to school in Baltimore for three years, but my apartment lease in Baltimore began December 2019. I still live part-time in Morristown with my parents,"" Matalon said. ""My license is still for NJ. My bank statements and utility bills come to Baltimore, but some other mail goes to Morristown.""
Matalon said she has been receiving ballots from Morristown in Baltimore for three years.
""Previous absentee ballots have been sent to my school address. In early October, I mailed a new absentee ballot request form for my new apartment in Baltimore,"" she said.
And when she didn't receive the ballot, she followed up with the county clerk.
""I was in contact with the Morris County Clerk throughout the past month, confirming my ballot was mailed. Then, each time my ballot didn't show up, I was in contact with them again to rush a new ballot,"" Matalon said.
But despite those efforts, those ballots ended up arriving too late for her to use. But that didn't stop Matalon from participating in the process. When her ballots didn't arrive, she was able to change her registration to Maryland and vote the same day.
""That is an opportunity most states don't allow, including NJ,"" she said. ""Not everyone has the resources to strategize how they can vote when their ballots are being kept from them.""
Matalon noted that she was lucky she had a car and utility bills and bank statements to be able to vote last-minute in Maryland. She also said that the incident put into focus the broader issue when it comes to voting concerns.
""Voter suppression is real,"" she said.

Since the change to this year's election was announced by Gov. Phil Murphy because of the coronavirus, there have been many questions about how the process will work.
Across Morris County, 292 of 301 precincts have reported results, which is approximately 97 percent. Tuesday was the last day ballots could be received in New Jersey. Provisional ballot tabulation began Wednesday. The issues in reporting continue to be no listing of what precincts are outstanding, so whether they are clustered in such a way that the impact the outcome of a close races is unknown.
""Every vote should be safe. Every vote should be secure. Every vote should be counted,"" Murphy said of the process.
All results are based off of unofficial tallies provided by the Morris County Clerk's Office. Results won't be official until they are certified. Certification is expected by Nov. 20.
