There are approximately 355,000 registered voters in Douglas County; more than 115,000 have already requested mail-in ballots. By comparison, in both the 2016 and 2018 primaries, approximately 70,000 voters cast ballots at either polling places or by mail.

The report is based on the cities' 2018 comprehensive annual financial reports, which are not analyzed on this scale by any other organization.
The analysis by Truth in Accounting (TIA), a nonprofit government finance watchdog group, found Omaha needs $1.2 billion to get out of the red, or $7,100.00 from each of its taxpayers.
According to the watchdog's annual Financial State of the Cities report, Omaha has $1.8 billion in bills and only $623.3 million in available assets to pay those bills after capital and restricted assets are excluded. This results in a $1.2 billion shortfall, or a $7,100.00 Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of the municipal debt after the city's available assets have been tapped.
TIA's Taxpayer Burden indicator incorporates both assets and liabilities, including all retirement liabilities. Fiscal year 2018 was the first year city governments reported all retirement liabilities, but TIA has been including this information in their analysis for the last several years.
The bottom line is that Omaha does not have enough money to pay its bills, which is why it received a ""D"" grade for its fiscal health.

Omaha Beach is located in the Isigny-Omaha Intercom, a region of 59 townships in northern France.
""Omaha Beach is part of our country's past, and will always be remembered,"" said Mayor Stothert.
""History connects us, and the future will provide many opportunities for cultural, educational, business, and most importantly, the personal relationships which are fundamental to all Sister Cities. It is an honor for the City of Omaha to develop a Sister City relationship with this region.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Low-income Nebraskans recovering from recent flooding could be eligible for food benefits through the Disaster SNAP (D-SNAP) program approved today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The department also approved the state's request for temporary flexibility in meeting school lunch meal pattern requirements.
Households who may not normally be eligible under regular SNAP rules may qualify for D-SNAP, if they meet the disaster income limits and have qualifying disaster-related expenses.
""USDA is committed to helping Nebraskans get back on their feet in whatever capacity we can,"" Food Nutrition and Consumer Services Acting Deputy Under-Secretary Brandon Lipps said. ""The D-SNAP program is an important step forward to help flood impacted families get food on the table.""
D-SNAP eligible households in the affected areas will receive one month of benefits, equivalent to the maximum amount of benefits normally issued to a SNAP household of their size, to meet their food needs. To be eligible for D-SNAP, a household must live in an identified disaster area, have been affected by the disaster, and meet certain D-SNAP eligibility criteria. Nebraska will share information about D-SNAP operating dates and locations through the local media.
The timing of D-SNAP implementation varies with the unique circumstances of each disaster but always begins after commercial channels of food distribution have been restored and families are able to purchase and prepare food at home. Before operating a D-SNAP program, a state must ensure that proper public information, staffing and resources are in place.
The D-SNAP announcement today is part of USDA's continuing efforts to help Nebraskans cope with the disaster. USDA is also allowing school lunch and breakfast meal pattern flexibility for schools in Nebraska through April 26.
USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) works to reduce food insecurity and promote nutritious diets among the American people. The agency administers 15 nutrition assistance programs that leverage American's agricultural abundance to ensure children and low-income individuals and families have nutritious food to eat. FNS co-develops the Dietary Guidelines for Americans with the HHS Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

LINCOLN, NE – USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) State Executive Director Nancy Johner today announced that emergency grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres has been authorized for all Nebraska counties, due to the impacts of recent adverse weather. Johner also announced that 45 Nebraska counties have been approved to begin accepting applications for the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) to address damages from recent flooding.
""FSA has a variety of disaster assistance programs to support farmers and ranchers through times of adversity,"" Johner said. ""Once you are able to evaluate your losses, it is important to contact your local FSA office to report all damages and losses and learn more about how we can assist.""
Emergency Grazing
The emergency grazing authorization is effective immediately and ends April 30, 2019. The authorization was granted to address the impacts of the recent extreme weather, including flooding, snowmelt and mud. CRP contract holders who are interested in using this emergency grazing authorization must contact their FSA county office to complete required paperwork before allowing grazing to begin.
""It is important for CRP contract holders to work with their FSA county office before moving their own livestock onto these acres or allowing another producer to move livestock there,"" Johner said.
CRP participants who use this option will need to obtain a modified conservation plan, which includes emergency grazing provisions, from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). CRP participants can allow others to use their CRP acres under this emergency grazing authorization; however, the livestock owners also will need to complete FSA paperwork indicating their grazing land was adversely impacted by severe weather. There will be no reduction in CRP rental payments to CRP contract holders who use the emergency grazing authorization. CRP contract holders are not permitted to charge livestock producers for the emergency grazing option.
Emergency Conservation Program
The approved ECP practices under this authorization include debris removal; fencing replacement and repair; grading, shaping and leveling of impacted fields; conservation structure rehabilitation; and shelterbelt rehabilitation.
ECP enrollment deadlines will vary by county as the timeframe is set by each county committee. More information on ECP enrollment deadlines will be provided by FSA county offices.
Counties approved to begin accepting applications include: Antelope, Boone, Boyd, Buffalo, Butler, Brown, Burt, Cass, Cedar, Colfax, Cuming, Custer, Dakota, Dixon, Dodge, Douglas, Franklin, Garfield, Greeley, Hall, Harlan, Holt, Howard, Keya Paha, Knox, Loup, Madison, Merrick, Nance, Nemaha, Otoe, Pierce, Platte, Polk, Richardson, Rock, Sarpy, Saunders, Sherman, Stanton, Thurston, Valley, Washington, Wayne and Wheeler.
ECP assists producers with the recovery cost to restore agricultural land to pre-disaster conditions. Approved ECP applicants may receive up to 75 percent of the cost of approved restoration activity.
""Dealing with natural disasters is never easy, especially when you have to consider the health and safety of livestock, but it's important for producers to call our office before they take action to permanently repair damages,"" said Johner.
Producers with damage must apply for assistance prior to beginning reconstructive work in order to qualify for cost-share assistance. This allows FSA offices to assess the need for on-site inspection and environmental compliance requirements, taking into consideration the type and extent of the damage.
The use of ECP funds is limited to activities to return the land to the relative pre-disaster condition. Conservation concerns that were present on the land prior to the disaster are not eligible for ECP assistance.

LINCOLN - Attorney General Doug Peterson has urged the U.S. Senate to enact the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act, legislation designed to curb illegal robocalls and spoofing.
A coalition of 53 attorneys general sent a letter to the U. S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation supporting the TRACED Act. The legislation is sponsored by Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.
As well as Attorney General Peterson the coalition is being led by North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald and Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood.
Attorney General Peterson said, ""State attorneys general are on the front lines of helping consumers who are harassed and scammed by unwanted calls. For years, we have worked with both our federal counterparts and industry participants to encourage the adoption of technological solutions in the fight against these calls. I am proud to support this legislation.""
In their letter, the attorneys general state that the TRACED Act enables states, federal regulators, and telecom providers to take steps to combat these illegal calls. The legislation will require voice service providers to participate in a call authentication framework to help block unwanted calls and creates an interagency working group to take additional actions to reduce robocalls and hold telemarketers and robocallers accountable.
More than 48 billion robocalls were made in 2018, making them the number one source of consumer complaints to the FTC and the FCC and resulting in millions in consumer losses. The state attorneys general work to enforce do-not-call laws and protect consumers in their states from being harassed and scammed by robocalls.
Attorney General Peterson is joined in sending this letter by the Attorneys General of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the District of Columbia.

Immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children or whose families overstayed visas said they are veterans of setbacks in the political arena. They added that they are also accustomed to being persistent, and they pledge to do the same in this situation.
The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that former President Barack Obama started in 2012. Those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they are eligible to renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn't accepting new applications. (For more information on Omaha's young immigrants and other Omaha stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
Opponents of the program said they are pleased with the Trump administration's decision. They called DACA an unconstitutional abuse of executive power.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who made Tuesday's announcement, said DACA was an overreach that could not be defended by the Justice Department. The Trump administration and other DACA opponents argue that it is up to Congress to decide how to deal with such immigrants.
Activists and immigrants have already launched efforts to fight the decision.
Zaida Mendez, 19, is a community college student who juggles jobs at a grocery store and a shoe store in the Omaha, Nebraska, area. She said she plans to work with advocacy groups to try to pressure the state's all-Republican congressional delegation to protect immigrant youths.
Mendez's parents brought her to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 1, and she didn't realize she was in the country illegally for years. She was among about 200 people who protested Trump's decision outside the Nebraska Capitol in Lincoln on Tuesday.
""I'm mad and I'm sad, but I'm not going to let that get to me,"" she said through tears.
A group that supports the program in Arizona is using a community summit this weekend to hold a session on DACA and reapplying. Another is holding an information session Wednesday on the program.
Maxima Guerrero, a leadership development coordinator for the Phoenix-based advocacy group Aliento, said her organization is considering creating a fundraising campaign to help DACA recipients renew before the October deadline.
""A lot of it right now is just kind of like first, taking the time to reflect on what the decision means, and what is happening. Making sure that people who are able to renew will have the support to do so,"" Guerrero said.
Guerrero, who is enrolled in the program, said advocates will also focus on providing emotional support during what many consider an emotionally taxing time.
""It's kind of tough because when something like this happens, it's like, what am I working for? I think a lot of it so far that has worked is just making sure we're providing the space and the opportunity to have those spaces to talk about how they're feeling to be able to reflect and to acknowledge and push the message that DACA does not define who we are as individuals and who we are as people overall,"" she said.
Supporters of the program demonstrated in New York City, where police handcuffed and removed over a dozen immigration activists who briefly blocked Trump Tower, and in other cities, including Salt Lake City, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Portland, Oregon. At some demonstrations, counter-protesters showed their support for Trump's decision.
John Willis, an Ontario, California, resident and handyman demonstrated in Los Angeles and carried a sign that read, ""American lives matter.""
""I'm here to support our president and our Attorney General Jeff Sessions to rescind this unlawful tyrannical executive order that our previous president thrust upon us,"" Willis said. ""I'm not a hater, I don't wish these kids to be sent back to Mexico or anything like that, but I don't believe we should have two sets of laws. We have one set of laws, we should follow them.""
Karen Marin, of New York, said that while she was disappointed that DACA is ending, she has survived without it before and can again. Marin, 26, was brought to the United States from Mexico as a baby. She's used her deferred action status to get a job that helps pay for college, where she is studying biotechnology.
She says the end of DACA doesn't mean the end of her dreams.
""It's just temporary status. It's not anything that is a permanent fix, and that's what we need, is something permanent. Something to help us continue moving forward as citizens of the United States because that's what we are,"" Marin said.
Diana Platas, a DACA recipient in Texas whose family lost their home in Hurricane Harvey, said the end of the program wasn't going to stop her.
""We're gonna continue to fight and we're gonna continue to push forward because we're not cowards. We know that we are doing and contributing the best that we can to this economy to this country because we call this our home. This is our home,"" Platas said.

12,/nebraska/omaha/nebraska-prisons-grossly-negligent-inmate-medical-needs-lawsuit,2017-08-17T12:24:26Z,Nebraska Prisons Negligent Of Inmate Needs: Suit,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"OMAHA, NE — The Nebraska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the state's prisons system, alleging that it didn't go far enough to address what the group calls inhumane conditions.
The ACLU filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of 11 prisoners against the state Department of Correctional Services, its director Scott Frakes and various prison system officials.
The lawsuit takes the system to task for what it calls the excessive use of solitary confinement and gross negligence of inmates' medical and mental health issues. It also points to rampant, persistent inmate overcrowding, as well as ""dangerous"" understaffing. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
The lawsuit includes nearly 20 pages dedicated to the specific treatment of the 11 prisoners, detailing among issues the failure to accommodate blind and deaf prisoners and the refusal to approve needed surgery and medication for others.
One of the inmates named as a plaintiff, Jason Galle, was sentenced in 2010 to 45 years in prison for attempted assault on a police officer and other felonies after breaking a vase over a Douglas County sheriff's deputy's head. Another deputy shot Galle in the thigh during the struggle.
The lawsuit says prison officials have refused to approve surgery for Galle to remove bone fragments and properly set his fractured femur.
""This injury causes him such pain that he was often unable to bend over or to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time,"" the lawsuit says. ""The pain is so severe that he is unable to exercise, and he frequently skips meals in order to avoid walking on his leg. This has caused him to lose an alarming amount of weight.""
The femur broke again last month, the lawsuit says, and Galle ""now cannot stand unassisted.""
A spokeswoman for the prison system declined to comment Wednesday morning.
The ACLU blames prison overcrowding and understaffing for deadly riots, staff assaults and escapes that have plagued the system in recent years. It notes Nebraska's prisons are designed to hold 3,275 prisoners, but were housing around 5,230 in March.
In April, the ACLU of Nebraska sent a letter to Gov. Pete Ricketts threatening to sue over the state's prison system if steps weren't taken to immediately improve conditions.
On Wednesday, Ricketts defended state government's efforts to improve prisons, saying in a written statement that prison reform has been a priority in recent years and that the state has ""invested millions of taxpayer dollars to protect public safety and expand state prisons.""
""This litigation from the ACLU threatens public safety by seeking the early release of dangerous criminals and could endanger our corrections officers by further limiting the tools they have to manage the inmate population,"" he said.
The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, asks a court order to require state officials to fix those problems. The only money it requests is to cover attorney and court costs.

Consequently, Nebraska's finances are in good health. The state has enough money to pay all of its bills with a leftover surplus of $1.7 billion, according to Truth in Accounting's (TIA) analysis of Nebraska's most recent financial filings. When broken down, this equates to a taxpayer surplus of $2,600 for each Nebraska taxpayer, which makes it a Sunshine State according to TIA.

These statistics are good for Nebraska, but what's troubling is that state government officials continue to obscure large amounts of retirement debt on their balance sheets, despite new rules to increase financial transparency. This skewed financial data gives state residents a false impression of their state's overall financial health.

Truth in Accounting is a Chicago-based nonprofit think tank that analyzes state financial reports when they are published. According to its report for 2016, Nebraska has $4.6 billion available in assets to pay $2.9 billion worth of bills. This means that Nebraska has $1.7 billion available after bills have been paid, which breaks down to $2,600 per taxpayer. TIA's Taxpayer Surplus™ measurement incorporates both assets and liabilities, not just pension debt.

Because of an accounting rule implemented last year, Nebraska had to report its pension debt on its balance sheet. This year, the state's reported pension debt grew from $181.7 million in 2015 to $331.3 million in 2016. However, Nebraska still excludes $111.1 million of liabilities because outdated pension valuations were used in the preparation of the financial statements. Unlike most states, Nebraska doesn't have any retiree health care debt, which is one of the reasons why it is in good shape.

The bottom line is that Nebraska has enough money to pay its bills, so it received a ""B"" for its finances. A ""B"" grade is given to states with a taxpayer surplus™ between $100 and $5,000.

Official Fired For Scalise Comment,0,0,Feroze Dhanoa,Patch Staff,"A Nebraska Democratic Party official has been ousted from his post after a recording emerged of him in which he was heard saying that he was glad GOP Rep. Steve Scalise had been shot and he wished the Louisiana representative was dead.
""Let me tell you, that (expletive,) who was he, the one who was shot, the Scafe guy,"" Phil Montag is heard saying in the recording, which first surfaced on the website talkrealsolutions.com on Thursday. ""I mean, that guy, what's his name Schasee.""
""Scalise,"" a woman is heard saying in response to Montag.
""I really don't want you to deflect right now,"" a man is heard saying.
""No, this (expletive,) like his whole job is like to get people, convince Republicans to (expletive) kick people off (expletive) health care,"" Montag says.
""I hate this (expletive,)"" he says.
""We know all of this,"" a woman can be heard saying, interrupting Montag. ""Phil, Phil,"" another man is heard saying, trying to interrupt Montag.
""I'm glad he got shot, I'm not gonna (expletive) say that in public,"" Montag says.
""Then what are you saying it to us for?"" the unidentified man present in the room says, sounding frustrated.
""I wish he was (expletive) dead,"" Montag says.
The man in the room trying to interrupt Montag then tells him that he has been recording their conversation and he will be publicly releasing the audio.
Scalise, who was in critical condition following the shooting during a GOP congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, was finally released from the ICU on Thursday, more than a week after the shooting. Four others, including two members of law enforcement, were injured in the shooting.
Doctors said he was now in fair condition but will require an extended period of healing and rehabilitation.
The lone gunman, identified as James Hodgkinson, of Illinois, was killed.
Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, removed Montag from his post, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Kleeb removed Montag, who served as the co-chair of the technology committee, after the paper sent her a recording of the audio.
In an interview with the paper, Montag said he was horrified by the shooting in Virginia and all gun violence. He added that the conversation had been taken out of context and the recording had been edited. About a minute of the conversation was posted online, and the entire conversation had lasted about 30 minutes or an hour, Montag told the paper.
The other two people involved in the conversation were identified as Nebraska Democratic Party Black Caucus Chair Chelsey Gentry-Tipton and a friend of hers, Destin Madison.
Gentry-Tipton herself had posted in a Facebook thread after the shooting that she had a hard time feeling bad for the GOP because they were the same people that push pro-NRA legislation. However, she refused to resign when asked to do so by Kleeb, the World-Herald reported earlier this week.
As the paper notes, Kleeb could not fire Gentry-Tipton because she was elected to her position.
