In addition to chants of ""I can't breathe"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" the protesters in Freehold repeatedly chanted at members of the borough police force, ""Kneel With Us.""
The ""kneel with us"" chant is a nod to actions by law enforcement all over — including in nearby Asbury Park — that have aimed to convey the message of support for the peaceful demonstrations and acknowledgement of anger over the killing of Floyd, 46, died when a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes.
""The death of George Floyd at the hands of four police officers is tragic, and more importantly, could have been avoided by just one of those officers doing the right thing,"" Freehold Borough Police Chief Craig W. Dispenza said in a written statement. ""The Freehold Borough Police Department condemns the acts of these four officers and mourns with the Floyd Family.""
A livestream of the Freehold protest posted by the Asbury Park Press showed the demonstrators, who later marched to the Monmouth County Courthouse, repeatedly urging Freehold officers to kneel with them in a visible show of support in an event that was more tense than some of the other protests.
Freehold police officers declined to kneel, which made some of those in attendance angry.
""They won't kneel because they don't (care),"" one young woman said, yelling.
Adults in the crowd repeatedly told the younger protesters that they needed to ""watch their tone"" and urged them to calm down and have discussions with the police instead of confrontations.
""Use your voice, not your fists,"" the woman said to the crowd.
She also had a message for the police officers.
""Understand their anger, their frustration,"" she said. ""They are afraid. They just want to know you're not going to kill them on sight.""
""All we're asking is for you to hear what we have to say,"" another young woman said.
""Racism is alive and we will combat it,"" said one woman who addressed the crowd at the Monmouth County Courthouse.
They demanded those participated stay peaceful.
""Stay intelligent, stay calm. You have a voice but use it in a way that helps,"" Shelly Torrens said. ""The system has to change. In an intelligent, peaceful manner, things will change.""
""Be peaceful, but be mad,"" said another woman, who mentioned she has a 5-year-old son. ""In 13 years, this could be him.""
""The Freehold Borough Police Department has long enjoyed a positive relationship with the community that we serve and plan to keep that relationship on track,"" Dispenza's statement said. ""Freehold Borough is a small town, and enjoys the benefits of being a small town, one of which is that our police officers and citizens know each other. For most of our residents, when they have an interaction with an officer they are dealing with someone they know, not a stranger in uniform.""
""Because we have such a tight-knit community, I believe that we can solve any issue which might arise,"" he said. ""Dealing with issues by involving the community, police and town officials, has been successful in the past and I believe will be successful in the future. Be safe and be proud of your community and stay Freehold Strong.""

1,/new-jersey/freehold/nj-person-graduation-rules-impossible-some-supers-say,2020-05-28T20:26:35Z,NJ In-Person Graduation Rules Frustrate Some,0,0,Karen Wall,Patch Staff,"FREEHOLD, NJ — The release of guidance giving New Jersey school districts three options for graduation ceremonies for the class of 2020 in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic was met with frustration from some superintendents in the state.
Gov. Phil Murphy announced Tuesday that in-person graduation ceremonies could be held beginning July 6, outdoors and with social distancing in place, warning that for some districts it could mean the need for multiple ceremonies.
On Thursday, as school officials digested the guidelines from the state Department of Education, they expressed frustrations over what they said was a lack of clear direction.
Charles Sampson, superintendent of the Freehold Regional High School District, acknowledged the coronavirus crisis has presented many challenges for schools. ""(There are) no easy answers with (the) COVID-19 crisis,"" he said in a tweet Wednesday evening, ""but in 13 years as a superintendent I have never seen so much dumped to schools to fend for themselves with limited, shifting, convoluted or zero guidance.""

The rules released Wednesday night by the education department tell districts ceremonies will be limited to the permitted gathering size at the time the ceremonies are held. Read more: NJ In-Person Graduations: Here Are The New Rules Amid Coronavirus
That limit, currently 25 people, is seen as an impediment to graduations particularly for schools with large graduating classes. But Murphy said the number of people permitted at a gathering will likely increase by July 6.
""I'll be shocked if it's 25 or even close to 25 by July 6,"" he said. Murphy acknowledged that school districts need advance notice to plan adequately, especially those districts that could be faced with multiple ceremonies.
""We want to give them notice, we get that,"" Murphy said. ""I'm just not going to do it today, because it's 39 days out and we don't have to, number one, and number two, Judy and Ed and I don't have the information we would want to have to be intelligent about that.""
Murphy's announcement allowing modified in-person graduations followed a few weeks of back-and-forth about what might happen. After he announced May 4 that schools would be doing remote learning for the remainder of the academic year, questions about graduation increased. On May 9, Col. Patrick Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, issued a letter saying ""wave parades"" or similar celebrations for graduating seniors were not permitted. Two days later, Callahan and Murphy reversed course and approved wave parades. On May 13, drive-in graduations were approved.
Wednesday evening's guidance said drive-in graduations were only permitted beginning July 6 — a change from what districts previously had understood. After questions were raised at Thursday's coronavirus conference, the guidance was updated again Thursday evening to note that drive-in graduation ceremonies could be held at any time, as can virtual graduations.
""Virtual graduation ceremonies offer a number of ways to celebrate this year's graduating class,"" state education officials said. ""DOE recommends that districts take full advantage of virtual ceremonies, which are the safest alternative graduation ceremony at this time.""
""We can all plan for anything. We just need a guiding path,"" said Eric M. Hibbs, superintendent of the Marlboro Township Public Schools. ""No organization can thrive attempting to successfully design so many paths at once trying to make the best decisions for our staff, students and community with no guidance.""
Murphy has repeatedly said that all of the decisions on reopening will be driven by the data, with the number of hospitalizations a prime concern. Reopening of beaches and boardwalks — frequently cited by those pushing for in-person graduations — was done with capacity limits and other restraints, Murphy said Thursday.

""When you're on a football field, it's only 100 yards long and 50 yards wide plus the end zones,"" he said. ""You are confined to that space, and we just gotta make sure we do it right.""

3,/new-jersey/freehold/freehold-regional-loses-5-8m-school-aid-murphys-budget,2020-02-28T19:15:54Z,Freehold Regional $5.8M In School Aid,0,0,Karen Wall,Patch Staff,"FREEHOLD, NJ — The Freehold Regional High School District is faced with significant cuts for the 2020-2021 school year, after learning it will be subject to a $5.8 million cut in state funding.
That's the amount announced by the state Department of Education on Thursday, two days after Gov. Phil Murphy announced his $40.98 billion budget for New Jersey for the 2020-21 fiscal year.
The cut is the result of S2, the law signed in 2018 by Murphy that set a schedule of cuts to so-called adjustment aid that a number of districts have been receiving since the School Funding Reform Act of 2008. Freehold Regional never received adjustment aid, however.
Under Murphy's budget proposal, Freehold Regional is scheduled to receive $40,732,705, a reduction of $5,782,685 from the 2019-2020 state aid award. That cut comes despite Murphy's statements in his budget address about the need to fund public schools to provide tax relief to the middle class.
""Our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community,"" Murphy said in his address. ""School funding is an investment in our future.""
""But, just as important, school funding is property tax relief,"" he said. ""Let's be absolutely clear – every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief. Every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn't have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers.""
The $5.8 million cut for 2020-2021 is more than double what was initially projected as the cut for the school year, based on a total cut of $25,211,640. The Education Law Center, which in 2018 calculated the potential cuts, estimated Freehold Regional would lose $2.5 million in the 2020-2021 school year.
The total cut in aid to the Freehold Regional district through S2 clearly will be higher than the what was initially projected. The district is receiving $9,985,047 less in aid in the 2020-2021 budget than it received in 2008-2009, the first year the School Funding Reform Act was in place. (Freehold Regional received $50,717,752 in aid in 2008-2009.)
""(The Freehold Regional High School District), who educates children for $3,500 less than average and runs comprehensive high schools with efficiency due to our regionalized scale, simply cannot absorb this,"" said Charles Sampson, superintendent of the district.
Because the cuts so far under S2 are so significantly different from the Education Law Center estimates, it's impossible to guess how deep the remaining cuts will be. The Education Law Center in January called for a halt to the cuts until state officials can take another look at the so-called formula the education department uses to calculate state aid. The state continues to refuse to release the formula and the methods it uses for the wealth calculations for each town, despite repeated Open Public Records Act requests. Read more: School Districts Seek 'Secret' Math Equation In School Aid Fight
Though Murphy also announced a $50 million allocation for ""stabilization"" aid, the process to apply for that aid will mean any funds Freehold Regional might receive will not be available until 2021 at the earliest.
Last July, the district, which serves 10,700 students from six towns, applied for emergency aid following the 2019-2020 cuts. It did not receive a response until December, at which time the district was notified it would receive no aid.
Though advocates of S2 and some state officials continue to insist taxpayers in the towns that make up the regional district — Freehold Borough, Freehold Township, Howell, Colts Neck, Marlboro and Manalapan — are not paying their fair share of property taxes to support their schools, raising the tax levy to make up for the cuts isn't an option.
Freehold Regional remains limited by the 2 percent cap on levy increases, and Murphy vetoed in January a bill that would have allowed districts that are under adequacy a waiver of the cap to bridge the hole created by the aid cuts.
A referendum asking voters to approve an increase in the tax levy would not be resolved until four months into the school year, too late for cuts made in the next 11 weeks (school districts must file their budgets with county superintendents by May 15) to be undone.
""We're glad to see historically struggling school districts such as Freehold Borough, Red Bank, and others finally starting to receive the resources they need to excel,"" state Senator Vin Gopal and Assembly members Eric Houghtaling and Joann Downey said in a joint statement. ""After many years of struggling to compensate for static funding in the face of growing enrollment, it's important that we're now starting to provide these students with the support they've long gone without.""
""Several schools in our district are on-track to lose state funds due to declining enrollment over the past several years — and in several cases, in greater proportions than the schools that are gaining funds,"" a joint statement from state Senator Vin Gopal and Assembly members Eric Houghtaling and Joann Downey said. ""Just as a sudden infusion of aid can provide a big boost to struggling schools, so too can a sudden hole in a school's budget pose a grave threat to vital student programs.""
""It's important to continue our efforts to build a more equitable funding system for all Garden State schools, but we need to do all we can to help schools transition painlessly to the new funding realities,"" the statement said.
The 11th District legislators called the stabilization aid ""little more than putting a bandaid on a much larger wound.""
""We need to take a long, hard look at more expansive reforms that could bring down costs in education and modernize our school funding formula,"" the statement said. ""By fully funding extraordinary special education aid, we can free up millions of dollars in school budgets across our state, making sure that special education funds follow the child instead of the district and lifting the burden on local property taxpayers.""
""We also need to strengthen regional school districts, supporting efficiently consolidated districts like Freehold Regional, and review and update the school funding formula to account for present-day costs of special education, transportation, free and reduced lunch, and other expenses.""
""If we come together, we fully believe that we can continue building a fairer, more efficient, and more effective school funding apparatus for all New Jersey students,"" they said.

4,/new-jersey/freehold/freehold-borough-schools-get-2m-aid-boost-murphys-budget,2020-02-28T17:50:16Z,Freehold Borough Schools Get $2M Aid Boost,0,3,Karen Wall,Patch Staff,"FREEHOLD, NJ — The Freehold Borough School District, which has been squeezed by growing enrollment for several years, is receiving an increase of more than $2 million in its state aid for the 2020-2021 school year.
That's the amount announced by the state Department of Education on Thursday, two days after Gov. Phil Murphy announced his $40.98 billion budget for New Jersey for the 2020-21 fiscal year.
Figures released by the state Department of Education show the borough school district, which has seen a 31 percent increase in enrollment since the 2008-2009 school year, will receive $17,351,053 in aid, a $2,096,571 increase over the 2019-2020 year.
That increase comes as the Freehold Regional High School District — where Freehold Borough students attend high school — is scheduled for an aid cut of nearly $5.8 million in aid. Both the Freehold Borough increase and the Freehold Regional cut are a result of S2, the law signed by Murphy in 2018 that put in specific timelines for addressing the needs of underfunded districts and also cutting adjustment aid from others.
Freehold Borough has been one of the districts that has been one of the highlighted in efforts to push the state to fully funds public schools. The district has seen its enrollment rise from 1,320 students in the 2008-2009 school year to 1,729 in 2017-2018, the most recent year available on the Taxpayers Guide to Education Spending on the education department's website.
Rocco Tomazic, the superintendent of the Freehold Borough Schools, said the increase would put the district at 70.6 percent of the state school funding it should be receiving.
The Education Law Center highlighted Freehold Borough's issues in 2016, noting the district was $550 per student under adequacy. Its increased enrollment also came with significant increases in at-rist/low-income students, who make up nearly three-quarters of the district's enrollment.
""Our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community,"" Murphy said in his state budget address on Tuesday. ""School funding is an investment in our future.""
Tomazic said the 2020-2021 increase puts the district closer to receiving 100 percent of the funding it should receive by 2024-2025, the end of the seven-year changes pushed through under S2, the law that amended the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 to put timelines on funding changes across the state.
""We're glad to see historically struggling school districts such as Freehold Borough, Red Bank, and others finally starting to receive the resources they need to excel,"" state Senator Vin Gopal and Assembly members Eric Houghtaling and Joann Downey said in a joint statement. ""After many years of struggling to compensate for static funding in the face of growing enrollment, it's important that we're now starting to provide these students with the support they've long gone without.""

6,/new-jersey/freehold/everykidcounts-campaign-aims-help-struggling-schools,2019-06-03T19:30:07Z,#EveryKidCounts Campaign Aims to Help...,0,0,Senator Vin Gopal,Neighbor,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
A new campaign named ""Every Kid Counts"" aims to win new public funds for extraordinary special education aid to schools across New Jersey. The initiative, started by New Jersey State Senator Vin Gopal (D-Long Branch), Assemblyman Eric Houghtaling (D-Neptune), and Assemblywoman Joann Downey (D-Freehold), is looking to obtain a larger portion of the State's budget to help schools afford the costs of programs for students with special needs.
""Every student, whether they have special needs or not, deserves a quality education,"" Gopal said. ""But it's becoming clear that districts can't bear this burden alone - and that when skyrocketing special education costs force schools to do more with less, every student loses. Local taxpayers can't afford to shoulder these costs, and educators are struggling to make do with the limited resources available. Someone else needs to step in.""
The ""Every Kid Counts"" campaign has established a petition with a goal of obtaining signatures from concerned parents, taxpayers, and educators from school districts across the Garden State. Interested residents can find the petition and additional information about the campaign at www.EveryKidCountsNJ.com.
The costs of extraordinary special education programs can come from a variety of sources. Common expenses include personal aides for students, custom learning resources including workbooks and other materials, and renovated classrooms to provide students a personalized learning space.
""Historically, schools with students receiving extraordinary special education aid have been critically underfunded,"" said Houghtaling. ""Right now, the State devotes $195 million to extraordinary special education aid, while estimates suggest that at least $380 million is necessary to fully meet our commitments. It's time for the State to meet our obligations on these high-cost programs, freeing up millions of dollars in funds statewide for schools to spend across their entire student body.""
Schools in New Jersey receive two types of special education funding. One type, basic funding for special education programs, is received by every school in the state, and is calculated by the school funding formula to match the population of students with special needs in each district.
The second type, extraordinary special education aid, is received only by schools whose students meet a certain threshold of expenses. For a student with special needs attending a public school in-district, the school is able to receive up to 90 percent of the cost for educating that student if those costs exceed $40,000.
A public school educating a student from outside of its district is also eligible if the cost of educating that student exceeds $40,000, but can only receive up to 75 percent of the costs from the State. A private school educating a student with special needs must meet a threshold of $55,000 for educating a single student, and can only receive up to 75 percent reimbursement for the costs of doing so.
Though eligible for greater amounts of extraordinary special education aid, qualifying schools have historically only received less than approximately 50% of their costs due to underfunding. If extraordinary special education aid is more fully funded, those schools would be able to receive funds closer to their cap for reimbursement."

Patrick S. Farrell, 37, of Clarksburg in Millstone Township, was sentenced Thursday to five years in state prison by Superior Court Judge Richard W. English in Monmouth County. Farrell pleaded guilty on Dec. 7, 2018 to a second-degree charge of computer theft. Farrell admitted he breached more than 1,000 private email accounts during a four-year period, Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said.
The investigation revealed that between October 2015 and April 2016, Farrell hacked into the cloud-based storage accounts of two women and, in each case, stole a sexually explicit video of the victim as well as one or more nude photos of the victim.
He did not know either victim and neither woman consented to him accessing her account, Grewal's office said.
In one case, he posted the stolen video on a video-sharing website and posted four nude photos of the victim on another multimedia sharing website. In the other case, he posted the sexually explicit video and a nude photo on the victim's own social media account.
Prosecutors noted at sentencing that Farrell admitted to investigators that he breached over one thousand private email accounts during a four-year period, stealing private photos and other personal information.
""Farrell violated the privacy of his two victims in a devastating way, leaving them fearful and insecure because their most intimate moments were exposed to family members, friends and total strangers,"" Grewal said. ""Beyond the incalculable emotional harm he inflicted, Farrell's breaches left the information in the victims' online accounts vulnerable to exploitation by other cybercriminals.""
""The crimes that Farrell committed were especially cruel and harmful to his victims,"" said Veronica Allende, director of the Division of Criminal Justice. ""We will continue to deploy the expertise and technology needed to bring offenders like Farrell to justice. Meanwhile, we urge people to be vigilant on the internet and social media, and to carefully secure their online accounts, because there are many types of cybercriminal, ranging from sexual predators to tech-savvy thieves.""
Deputy Attorneys General Remy and Huynh prosecuted Farrell under the supervision of Bureau Chief Julia S. Glass and Deputy Bureau Chief Jillian Carpenter of the Division of Criminal Justice Financial & Computer Crimes Bureau.
Grewal commended those attorneys, as well as the detectives and officers who conducted the investigation for the New Jersey State Police Troop C Criminal Investigations Office, Cyber Crimes Unit, and Digital Technology Investigations Unit, and the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office, New Brunswick Police Department, and Montclair State University Police Department.

The grants were among $161.25 million being distributed to 537 towns that were announced Friday by the office of Gov. Phil Murphy under the Municipal Aid ""Commitment to Communities"" program.
The program has seven categories of grants: Roadway Preservation, Roadway Safety, Quality of Life, Mobility, Bikeway, Pedestrian Safety, and Bridge Preservation.
Freehold Borough will receive $250,000 for road improvements to Bannard Street, and Freehold Township will receive $240,000 for the Phase I roadwork on Iron Bridge Road.
The competitive Municipal Aid grant program attracted 681 applications from 544 different municipalities with a total of $377 million in work. Under the program, each county is apportioned a share of the total funding based on population and the number of local centerline miles and towns compete for portions of their county's share. NJDOT provides 75 percent of the grant amount when a town awards a contract and the remaining 25 percent upon completion of the project.

Pflug pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a second-degree charge of theft by unlawful taking, the attorney general's office said.
Pflug was indicted as a result of an investigation by the state's Office of Public Integrity and Accountability. New Horizons, a nonprofit based in Monmouth County, provides services to those with autism, including through the operation of group homes.
New Horizons receives the vast majority of its program funding through a contract with the New Jersey Division of Developmental Disabilities. Pflug, as chief financial officer of New Horizons, was entrusted with use of the organization's credit cards and checking accounts to make purchases for the nonprofit.
The investigation revealed that from June 2015 through February 2018, Pflug used the nonprofit's accounts to make approximately $114,917 in personal expenditures, frequently recording the products and services as purchases made for group homes operated by the nonprofit. Detectives searched Pflug's home in April 2018 and identified numerous items and home improvements paid for using New Horizons credit cards and financial accounts.
""Pflug abused his position as chief financial officer of this nonprofit by stealing nearly $115,000 in funds – consisting mostly of tax dollars – that were intended to provide services to individuals with autism,"" Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said. ""This prison sentence sends a strong message that those who steal and abuse their positions of trust will be held accountable.""
""Pflug betrayed the nonprofit that employed him and the vulnerable population served by the nonprofit,"" said Thomas Eicher, director of the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability. ""Moreover, he stole from New Jersey taxpayers. We have zero tolerance for this type of corrupt conduct.""
The Office of Public Integrity and Accountability has a toll-free tipline 1-844-OPIA-TIPS for the public to report corruption, financial crimes and other illegal activities confidentially.
The Attorney General's Office also has an Anti-Corruption Reward Program that offers a reward of up to $25,000 for tips from the public leading to a conviction for a crime involving public corruption. Information is posted on the Attorney General's website; click here.

10,/new-jersey/freehold/freehold-twp-weed-ban-would-be-null-void-under-state-bill,2019-03-22T04:04:25Z,Freehold Twp Weed  Ban Would Be 'Null And Void',0,0,Karen Wall,Patch Staff,"FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP, NJ — Freehold Township's ordinance banning the retail sales of marijuana would be rendered ""null and void"" if the state Legislature passes the bill to legalize recreational marijuana use in New Jersey.
The Township Committee approved the prohibition on the sale of marijuana — both recreational and medicinal — and the manufacture, growth, cultivation ""or conduct of any farming activities related to marijuana"" in Octover 2018.
However, Senate Bill 2703 (and its companion, Assembly Bill 4497), the bills that would legalize recreational marijuana, include a provision that would make ""null and void"" any ordinances that have been passed in towns across the state to ban the sales of either or both.
""... any ordinance enacted by a local governmental entity prior to the effective date of this section addressing the issue of prohibiting one or more types of cannabis-related activities within the jurisdiction of the local governmental entity is null and void,"" the bill says.
Any municipality that wants to ban sales, facilities, growing operations or manufacture of marijuana products — for either adult recreational use or for medicinal purposes — would have 180 days following the enactment of the pending bill to legalize recreational marijuana use by adults to enact an ordinance banning the facilities, if they still sought to do that.
Wall is one of more than 50 towns that have banned retail sales ahead of the proposed marijuana legalization.
Legislative committees in both the New Jersey Senate and the Assembly approved the bill that would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older in the state this week. The bill now heads to the full Senate and Assembly, which would each need to approve it before the bill could land on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk for his signature. Read more: NJ Recreational Pot Bill Approved By Committees; Final Vote Soon
If the current legislation is passed and signed into law, marijuana use for adults 21 and older becomes legal throughout the state, and municipalities who wish to ban it will have to ""opt out.""
A commission will be established by the state to establish regulations concerning growth, sale, taxation and other aspects of the law. Once those regulations are passed and made public, towns will then have 180 days to decide what actions they want to take.
For the towns that have bans already in place, they will be forced to adopt them again — which comes with expense of the legal advertisements, the public hearings and the conflicts that have marked the debates in many towns. More than 50 towns across the state have preemptively passed bans since Murphy was elected, after he campaigned on legalizing recreational marijuana.
The information that the proposed legislation includes voiding the already passed ordinances was highlighted at a forum in South Jersey Wednesday night in Camden County to answer residents' questions about the potential impacts of legalization.
William J. Caruso of Archer Law spoke at the forum organized by the Camden County Mayors' Association and provided an overview of the legislation and answered questions. Read more: Prohibition, Safety Discussed At Marijuana Legalization Forum

Jamil S. Hubbard, 26, of Sayreville, was indicted on seven counts, including first-degree murder and first-degree felony murder in the death of Jerry Wolkowitz, 56, Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni announced Monday.
Wolkowitz, a professional photographer and freelance photojournalist, was hospitalized following the attack and died Oct. 18, 2018, from the injuries he suffered May 1, 2018. He never regained consciousness.
Freehold Township police found Wolkowitz lying in the parking lot of his Harding Road apartment complex about 7:15 a.m. on May 1, with injuries to his head and body.
Detectives from the Freehold Township Police Department and the Monmouth County prosecutor's office allege Hubbard approached Wolkowitz from behind, punching Wolkowitz in the head and face, and then dragged him into the parking lot. Authorities allege Hubbard then drove his motor vehicle over Wolkowitz, and stole Wolkowitz's vehicle. It was later discovered abandoned on Bordentown Avenue in Sayreville.
Hubbard was arrested at his home later on May 1 by Sayreville police. He remains in the Monmouth County Correctional Institute pending trial, where he has been since his arrest.
The investigation determined Hubbard did not know or have any prior contact with Wolkowitz before the attack, the prosecutor's office said.
Wolkowitz, who was a professional photographer for more than 30 years, also had been a volunteer for the Freehold First Aid Squad and a driver for SAS Ambulance.
Hubbard was indicted in July 2018 by a Monmouth County grand jury on charges of first-degree attempted murder, third-degree possession of a weapon (a motor vehicle) for an unlawful purpose and first-degree bias intimidation, in connection with the attack.
A GoFundme remains active to help with the costs of Wolkowitz's medical and legal expenses; click here to contribute.

Peter Pflug, 56, of Freehold, pleaded guilty to second-degree theft by unlawful taking before Superior Court Judge Ellen Torregrossa-O'Connor in Monmouth County. Under the plea agreement, the state will recommend that Pflug be sentenced to three years in state prison. He will be required to pay full restitution, Grewal's office said.

Richard Busby, 61, formerly of Newark, was sentenced to 60 years in prison and must serve a minimum of 30 years before he is eligible for parole under the sentence handed down Friday by Monmouth County Superior Court Judge Paul Escandon, Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni said.
Among the factors noted by Escandon was Busby's extensive prior criminal history; he had 11 prior felony convictions, including armed robbery and related offenses, dating back to 1978.
Busby was found guilty in September following a jury trial of felony murder, robbery and attempted murder in the death of Michael Conway and the attempted murder of Conway's girlfriend, Cheri Plamondon.
Busby and his accomplice. Jeffrey Mayhue, broke into the Jackson Mills Road home of Conway and Plamondon early on July 31, 2011, held the couple at gunpoint and bound them with zip-ties while Busby and Mayhue searched their home for money, marijuana and other items of value.
During the robbery, Conway broke free and struggled with Busby and Mayhue, and he was shot and killed. The two then set fire to the home and fled. Plamondon was able to free herself and escape the burning building.
Mayhue, 55, previously pled guilty to charges of armed robbery and felony murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Sept. 7, 2016. He must serve 30 years before being eligible for parole.
Subsequent to Mayhue's plea, charges were signed against additional accomplices: Ellis Goodson, 41, of Neptune and Ranu Sinha, 39, of Freehold. Both later pled guilty to armed robbery.
Goodson and Sinha also pleaded guilty to an additional charge of armed robbery in a separate home invasion robbery that happened May 14, 2011 at a home on Brickyard Road in Howell. Mayhue entered the home with a handgun, bound the occupants and stole a large sum of money. Goodson and Sinha were charged and subsequently pled guilty to being accomplices to the planning of that robbery. Busby was not charged in the May 14, 2011 incident.
Goodson and Sinha also were sentenced Friday, the prosecutor's office said.
Goodson was sentenced to 13.5 years in prison by Judge Joseph Oxley, and his sentence is subject to the No Early Release Act requiring him to serve 85 percent of his sentence before being eligible for parole, and a mandatory period of parole supervision after release.
Sinha was sentenced to 10 years in prison by Escandon, also subject to the No Early Release Act, the prosecutor's office said.
Gramiccioni credited the resolution of the cases to the strength of the victims and the strong collaboration between the prosecutor's office and the Freehold Township, Howell and Neptune Township police departments.

The Freehold Township Committee voted unanimously to bar all sales of marijuana, along with all cultivation of the plant, in the township, the Asbury Park Press reported.
The ordinance, which can be found here, bars selling any type of marijuana and related paraphernalia, and prohibits the growing, cultivation or harvesting of any type of marijuana plant within the township.
The ordinance is more restrictive than ordinances in other towns that have enacted bans. In most cases, those bans only have addressed recreational marijuana. Point Pleasant Beach passed an ordinance banning all marijuana businesses in the borough in 2017, but Berkeley Township banned only recreational marijuana.
Other towns, including Brick Township and Toms River, have not yet taken action, though Toms River had an ordinance under consideration that later was shelved.
In Brick, an application is pending before the township's Board of Adjustment from a company seeking a state license to open a medical marijuana dispensary.

The council also pledged to listen to constituents and engage with the community by seeking out a diverse range of input, experiences and stories.
The effort to review these policing policies is an outgrowth of the nationwide protests surrounding the death of George Floyd while he was in police custody. Floyd's passing – which occurred exactly three weeks before the Monday resolution – has stirred up a significant dialogue about racism and the use of force by police in America.
""The Borough of Freehold pledges to continue to assess all of its laws and policies and engage the community at large in moving forward to eradicate systemic racism,"" the resolution reads.
In addition, the committee pledged to work with the police department, community leaders and residents to review police use of force policies, provide feedback on existing action and ultimately reform the community's police use of force policies 'as necessary'.
""This is not an indictment of all police officers, but just those that express a blatant disregard for their oath and human decency towards people of color,"" the resolution reads.

21,/new-jersey/freehold/rep-smith-jcp-ls-isaias-response-was-extraordinarily-slow,2020-08-12T22:13:53Z,Rep. Smith: JCP&L's Isaias Response Was ...,1,20,Nicole Rosenthal,Patch Staff,"FREEHOLD, NJ – After Tropical Storm Isaias rattled the Garden State and left over 200,000 Monmouth County residents without power at the height of the storm, many locals criticized municipal officials and power authorities for slow restoration efforts.
In a letter dated Aug. 10 to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, congressman Chris Smith (NJ-4) expressed similar feelings towards energy provider JCP&L, calling the company's response ""extraordinarily slow"" and ""unreasonably burdensome on the rate payers"".
Read Smith's full letter here.
""Reports estimate that 1.7 million people went without power after Superstorm Sandy–a destructive multi-day storm that brought loss of life, devastation to property and out economy, and outages that lasted weeks in some cases,"" Smith wrote in the letter, addressed to New Jersey Board of Public Utilities president Joe Fiordaliso. Yet, after eight years and one-billion dollars in infrastructure investments, Tropical Storm Isaias blew through the area in a matter of four or five hours and left a stunning 1.4 million people without power in New Jersey. And nearly five days later, on Sunday morning, August 9th, nearly 27,000 Jersey Central Power & Light customers were still unplugged.""
The congressman also detailed that constituents who rely on electric-power well water – namely in Manalapan, Millstone, Colts Neck, Wall Township and Upper Freehold – went largely without fresh water during several hot days in August. He also described how nearly all JCP&L customers in Fair Haven, Roosevelt and Millstone lost power. Four days after Isaias, 90% of Fair Haven residents were still left in the dark, according to Smith.
""While some water and ice were provided for free, the lack of running water in homes and businesses raises additional sanitary concerns,"" the congressman wrote.
Smith called JCP&L's response ""frustrating to constituents"", a ""lack of communication"" in failing to provide estimates for many municipalities. While a ""global restoration date"" was provided (listed as Aug. 11 at 11:30 p.m., over one week after the storm), Smith argued that the absence of restoration estimates on a town-by-town basis left many residents unprepared.
The congressman concluded the letter with a request for the Board of Public Utilities to increase its oversight over JCP&L ""to ensure that the utility has a viable, rapid-response plan"" that can identify and overcome storm recovery program weaknesses, anticipate sanitary health needs and demonstrate its preparedness to address power outages in the future.
""There may be no way to prevent all outages, but our utilities must constantly strive to be ready for the next storm,"" Smith wrote. ""Unfortunately, it appears that the response of JCP&L has lagged that of other utilities and has unduly burdened customers, disrupting their daily activities and costing them dearly in lost goods and productivity."""

23,/new-jersey/freehold/bill-eliminate-freeholder-title-passes-through-state-senate,2020-07-31T15:04:52Z,Bill To Eliminate 'Freeholder' Title Passes...,0,3,Nicole Rosenthal,Patch Staff,"FREEHOLD, NJ – Thursday saw two bills aimed at addressing racial justice pass in New Jersey's state Senate, one of which seeks to abolish the term freeholder.
The other bill passed designates Juneteenth – a commemoration of June 19, 1895 when the last slaves were notified of their freedom – as a state holiday.
Discussions surrounding the removal of the 'freeholder' term began earlier this month, when Gov. Phil Murphy announced his support to eliminate the ""outdated"" title on July 10. Yesterday's measure was approved with a vote of 31-6.
New Jersey serves as the only state in the country that still uses the title freeholder for county officials. Each of the state's 21 counties elect county officials who serve a board of chosen freeholders, which approve taxpayer-funded budgets for public projects.
The title originates as an old British legal term and refers to a debt-free landowner. The freeholder title was a requirement to hold public office at a time when only white men could own land. Critics of the term call it a vestige of the state's colonial past, where property during the period could have also constituted slaves.
""I'm not saying that someone who has the title of Freeholder is someone invested in structural racism,"" said Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway in an online briefing about the term, which the governor later shared on Twitter. ""But I am saying that the title itself has a legacy that grows out of denying people access, denying people the right to have a voice.""
While state and local officials have attempted to do away with the term in the past, the title has gained attention in recent months as conversations about racial inequality and police brutality have stirred in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25 elicited protests attended by millions around the world.
Murphy is slated to review the measures next. The governor has stated previously that he is in support of both initiatives.
""As our nation tears down symbols of injustice, we must also tear down words we use in New Jersey that were born from racism,"" Murphy, Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin wrote in a joint statement earlier this month. ""It's past time for New Jersey to phase out the term 'freeholder' from our public discourse — a term coined when only white male landowners could hold public office. This is not a matter of political correctness; it is a corrective action to replace an outdated designation that is rooted in institutional prejudice.""
In addition to strides made at the state level, Burlington County Freeholder Director Felicia Hopson announced her support of eradicating the term on July 14, announcing plans to phase out the term from county materials, signs, letterheads and communications.

It was not immediately clear what the fate of municipality names such as Freehold Borough, Upper Freehold or Freehold Township would be.
Earlier this month, Freeholder Director Thomas A. Arnone wrote in a statement that the state's announcement to change the term was ""mind blowing"".
""This is not the time for grand standing and changing the title of elected officials is not going to help anyone,"" wrote the official. ""Not only will it not help, but changing the title right now is actually going to cost our taxpayers money, when so many are already struggling. We have businesses that cannot open, hundreds of businesses who are closing permanently, and more than 1.3 million people on unemployment, not to mention the thousands of residents who are being furloughed.""
Under the new bill, freeholders will be referred to as county commissioners.
""They say actions speak louder than words and the actions of the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders have been and will continue to be done in the best interest of our residents—no matter what we are called,"" the Freeholder Director wrote.

""My fellow Freeholders and I are gravely concerned as the exclusive mail-in ballot 'experiment' has been difficult at best and should not be conducted when selecting individuals to lead Boards of Educations, political parties and bodies of government,"" said Freeholder Director Thomas A. Arnone in a release. ""As we have seen repeatedly in the past, using mail-in ballots increases the risk of voter fraud and causes delays in counting ballots.""
Individuals in the state have already been charged with voter fraud in connection to the state Attorney General in Paterson's May 12 city council election, as several persons have been charged with illegally collecting and processing mail-in ballots in Paterson.
Other officials throughout the state, including New Jersey Assemblywoman BettyLou DeCroce, who represents the state's 26th district in Essex County, has called in-person voting ""as safe or safer"" than other methods like mail-in voting.

In addition, the Freeholders stated that voters should continue to be given the option for 'how to vote,' in addition to 'who to vote for'.
""The Board of Chosen Freeholders believes that voter choice should refer to 'how to vote,' in addition to 'who to vote for,' in any given election cycle,"" said the Freeholder Director. ""On behalf of the Board, I urge the Secretary of State and 21 County Clerks to utilize in-person voting in conjunction with mail-in balloting come Tuesday, November 3. After regularly corresponding with the Governor's Office about this matter, we hope that a decision is made before our next Freeholder Meeting.""
A certified true copy of the resolution was submitted to the New Jersey Secretary of State, Governor, President of the New Jersey State Senate, Speaker of the General Assembly, Monmouth County Legislative Delegation, New Jersey Association of Counties and the other 20 Boards of Chosen Freeholders throughout New Jersey.

29,/new-jersey/freehold/gov-murphy-signs-nj-coronavirus-legislation-8-bills-law,2020-09-15T13:05:30Z,"Gov. Murphy Signs NJ Coronavirus Legislation, 8...",3,89,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY – Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation on Monday that addresses the NJ coronavirus outbreak, providing benefits to those who contract COVID-19 while on the job.
Under the law (A-3999/S-2380), essential employees whose jobs require interaction with the public during the public health emergency will be eligible for benefits normally given to workers who suffer an injury or illness on the job if they contract COVID-19.
The workmen's compensation benefit will be provided unless a ""preponderance of evidence"" indicates an essential worker was not exposed to COVID-19 on the job, lawmakers said.
Otherwise, it will be presumed that the infection was work-related in order to ensure eligibility for these benefits.
Murphy also signed legislation to promote electric vehicle use and address sex assaults in prisons.
The governor also vetoed a bill that would have extended a state loan program to include certain small producers and retailers of alcoholic beverages.
Here are the bills signed into law:
Work-related benefits to essential employees who Contract COVID-19
The bill, sponsored by Assembly Democrats Thomas Giblin, John Burzichelli, Carol Murphy and Joann Downey, noted that many of these workers provide essential services related to public health and safety.
""When they first entered the workforce, none of these essential workers could have imagined the kind of danger and extreme challenges this pandemic would one day present them with,"" said Giblin, D-Essex, Passaic. ""Yet these dedicated workers have heroically stepped up and put their health on the line in order to help their fellow community members get through this unprecedented crisis.""
The New Jersey Business and Industry Association, however, took issue with the legislation.
President and CEO Michele Siekerka complained that the legislation allows a presumption that certain essential employees contract COVID-19 on the job and then shifts the response costs onto New Jersey's workers compensation system.
""Over the course of this pandemic, we have heard Governor Murphy express sympathy and empathy for New Jersey businesses struggling to survive. Today, we are disappointed to say that those words ring hollow,"" Siekerka said.
""Like the lawmakers who voted to put this misguided bill on his desk, Governor Murphy made a conscious choice to place additional burdens of a worldwide pandemic on the backs of struggling New Jersey employers who have made great sacrifices.""
Siekerka said there is federal CARES Act money specifically meant to cover the costs of essential workers who truly do contract COVID-19 on the job. Instead, that money was left on the table and employers are forced to pick up those costs, he said.
""More disappointingly, Governor Murphy had the opportunity to conditionally veto this bill to limit the time frame of its application to the stay-at-home order, when an essential employee had far fewer movements between work and home.
Commission to study sex assault in prisons
Murphy signed a measure (AJR-167) to create a commission to study sexual assault, misconduct and harassment by staff against incarcerated individuals in state correctional facilities.
The new law is sponsored by Assembly Democrats Valerie Vainieri Huttle, D-Bergen; Cleopatra Tucker, D-Essex; and Carol Murphy, D-Burlington.
The April report released by the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's Office District of New Jersey revealed more than 70 documented investigations into potential staff misconduct, lawmakers said.
It concluded that there are long-standing, systemic problems involving sexual abuse by staff members that both the facility and the state Department of Corrections have failed to remedy, lawmakers said.
The measure signed into law creates a 17-member commission comprised of state leaders and members of the public to examine issues affecting the safety and rights of incarcerated individuals in state correctional facilities.
College athletes earning endorsement compensation
A new law sponsored by Assembly Democrats Lisa Swain, Chris Tully and Benjie Wimberly, all D-Bergen, Passaic, allows college athletes to earn compensation for use of their name, image or likeness.
The new law (A-2106), known as the ""New Jersey Fair Play Act,"" received final legislative approval in July, passing the full Assembly 56-16-2, and full Senate 30-9.
""Athletes are the faces of the industry. They are the ones out there on the field, putting in the work that will attract spectators and create opportunities for businesses to profit,"" said Swain. ""It's only fair that they have the right to earn compensation for their work.""
Under the new law, a four-year institution of higher education is prohibited from upholding any rule, requirement, standard or other limitation that prevents college athletes from earning compensation from their name, image or likeness. Earning such compensation will not affect the student's scholarship eligibility.
Electric vehicle charging stations
A bill (A-1993), sponsored by Assembly Democrats Nancy Pinkin, Dan Benson, and Jim Kennedy, that would improve residential access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure was signed into law on Monday.
""Taking steps to mitigate the impact of today's climate crisis is critical if we are to protect public health and our environment,"" said Pinkin, D-Middlesex. ""With transportation accounting for nearly half our state's emissions, it is essential that we continue to break down barriers to EV adoption. By providing for more convenient access to charging infrastructure, we can facilitate the adoption of greener technologies.""
The new law will specifically require that developers offer and inform prospective homeowners of the option to install in-home EV charging as part of new construction in certain residential developments of 25 or more units.
Here is the list of bills signed into law:"

Phil Murphy on Friday. The bill requires the official title of freeholder to be changed to county commissioner, effective Jan. 1 of next year.
The legislation also requires county officials to change letterheads, stationary and websites to list the title of county commissioners in place of freeholders. New Jersey serves as the only state left in the country to use the freeholder term for county officials.
Related: 'Freeholder' Title Abolished In New Jersey
The term originates as an old British legal word and refers to a debt-free landowner. The title was a requirement to hold public office at a time when only white men could own land. Critics of the term call it a vestige of the state's colonial past, where property during the period could have also included slaves.
""Amid a national reckoning to reexamine vestiges rooted in structural racism, this action will eliminate the use of the term 'Freeholder' in county government— a title that is an outgrowth of a time when people of color and women were excluded from public office,"" Murphy said Friday.
Per the legislation, Nick DiRocco of Wall Township serves as the last individual in Monmouth County to be sworn in as a freeholder. The former mayor of Wall was elected in 2019 alongside Freeholder Director Thomas A. Arnone. DiRocco was sworn in earlier this year.
Two seats are open in the Nov. 3 election for Monmouth County Freeholders. Individuals who are elected in November are slated to be sworn in as commissioners next year.
Related: Bill To Eliminate 'Freeholder' Title Passes Through State Senate
Yet, the legislation didn't pass without its critics: in a statement last month, Freeholder Director Thomas A. Arnone voiced his disapproval for the name change, calling the decision ""mind blowing.""
""This is not the time for grandstanding and changing the title of elected officials is not going to help anyone,"" the official said in a statement.
""They say actions speak louder than words and the actions of the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders have been and will continue to be done in the best interest of our residents—no matter what we are called.""

The submissions, which must all consist of a community-oriented end goal and serve the public for at least five years, were reviewed by a committee earlier this year. The board then selects 10 projects that are voted on by citizens for the top three. The final choices are then voted on by the borough council.
The total allocated funds for the projects is $200,000, which serves as part of the borough's $1 million capital improvement plan, according to the Asbury Park Press. Last year's vote saw four projects emerge, all falling below the $200,000 maximum.

This year's election proposed 10 projects, including traffic light generators, an electronic information billboard, Jackson Road speed bumps, an ADA-approved fishing pier at Lake Topanemus, benches and tables at Lake Topanemus and ADA-approved playground equipment at Veterans Park.
Freehold Borough was the first municipality in the Garden State to utilize participatory budgeting, which is now practiced in West Orange and Neptune City, according to the Press.

37,/new-jersey/freehold/gov-murphy-signs-4-nj-coronavirus-bills-law-vetoes-2-others,2020-12-18T13:22:37Z,Gov. Murphy Signs 4 NJ Coronavirus Bills In Law...,0,68,Tom Davis,Patch Staff,"NEW JERSEY — Gov. Phil Murphy signed four bills into law this week that are intended to provide a boost to New Jersey amid the coronavirus crisis — such as smoothing out issues at Motor Vehicle Commission sites — while vetoing two others.
Murphy signed a bill into law that allows new drivers who passed their road tests to drive for 60 days while they are waiting to get their probationary driver's license. He also signed legislation to ensure hospitals and long-term care facilities have enough personal protective equipment (see the signed and vetoed bills below).
Murphy vetoed a bill that was intended to protect New Jersey residents who are receiving care for mental health, behavioral health and addiction services. The bill, S-2708, would have required state contracts to contain a commitment that service will not be disrupted or delayed by labor disputes.
""Mental and behavioral health services are critical to the health, safety and well-being of all New Jersey residents,"" said Senate President Steve Sweeney. ""The recipients of these services are our state's most vulnerable population and any disruption, whether in the middle of a pandemic or not, can be life-threatening and even endanger the public at large. These workers are essential and they deserve all the protections we can provide.""
Murphy said he commends the bill's sponsors for promoting goals that he shares — protecting reasonable access for labor unions to organize and encouraging amicable labor-management relationships.
""And in the settings of mental health, behavioral health, and addiction services, where the state depends on contracts with reliable providers, labor harmony agreements can help protect the state's proprietary interest in the efficient delivery of services,"" he said.
But Murphy also said the state needs to balance those goals against the need to ensure continuity of care ""and maintain a sufficient number of providers for the vulnerable population of individuals serviced by this workforce.""
""I am concerned that automatic non-renewal or cancellation of contracts could result in gaps in the availability of mental health, behavioral health, and addiction services,"" he said.
Murphy called for additional safeguards to ensure the state can continue to serve these critical populations. He also wants to require providers to commit to making a good-faith effort to comply with all applicable COVID-19 health and safety protocols that protect workers and service recipients alike.
Here are the bills Murphy signed into law:
Addressing backlog at MVC sites
Murphy signed a bill into law that addresses the continued backlog of New Jersey residents waiting to get a driver's license following the monthslong closure of Motor Vehicle Commission offices amid the coronavirus crisis.
The bill, A-4442/S-2755, will allow new drivers who passed their road tests to drive for 60 days while they are waiting to get their probationary driver's license.
The legislation (A-4442) allows drivers who have passed their road tests to operate vehicles under the same restrictions as a probationary license.
Probationary license restrictions include: no driving between 11:01 p.m. and 5 a.m.; no more than one passenger in the vehicle with the driver; an identifying decal on the front and rear license plates for all probationary drivers under 21; and no use of cell phones, including hands-free. Some restrictions are subject to limited exceptions.
The law previously passed the Assembly in August 77-0, and the Senate in October 35-0.
The measure is part of a package of Sen. Anthony M. Bucco-sponsored legislation to accommodate motorists who have been frustrated by extensive delays at MVC facilities as a result of increased demand caused by the pandemic.
""We can shorten the lines for motorists who need to conduct business in person and lighten the workload for commission employees by postponing one interaction with motor vehicles for every new driver,"" said Bucco (R-Morris).
""The delays and congestion at MVC are inexcusable, and it is clear the commission needs some help and guidance from the Legislature. This is one of many simple tweaks that can help New Jersey residents get the services they need without forcing them to spend hours and days waiting in line.""
Ensuring enough personal protective equipment
Murphy signed legislation to ensure long-term care facilities and hospitals have appropriate supplies of vital personal protective equipment (PPE) on hand for residents and patients during public health emergencies.
The legislation requires licensed facilities in New Jersey to maintain an emergency inventory. The law previously passed the Assembly in September 79-0, and the Senate in October 35-0.
Under the new law (A-4282/A-4150), long-term care centers are required to maintain stockpiles of PPE sufficient for 30 or 60 days, depending on the number of facilities owned by the health system.
Facilities not owned by a system or are part of a system with fewer than eight centers are able to enter a collaborative agreement with other facilities to share PPE.
Hospitals are required to maintain a 90-day supply of PPE at all times.
In the event of a public health emergency, long-term care facilities and hospitals need to immediately re-evaluate their PPE inventory and secure additional supplies as needed.
The state Department of Health is permitted to impose fines or other administrative remedies against facilities which violate the requirements of the law.
Sponsors of the new law — Nancy Pinkin (D-Middlesex), Robert Karabinchak (D-Middlesex), Daniel Benson (D-Mercer, Middlesex) and Valerie Vainieri Huttle (D-Bergen) — released the following joint statement:
""At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to personal protective equipment was scarce. Many long-term care facilities lacked a stockpile of supplies. Masks, gloves, face shields and sanitizers are critical to mitigating the spread of COVID-19; without them, the virus spreads rapidly. Unfortunately, limited access to these supplies led to the devastating outbreaks that we saw happen in our long-term care facilities.
""Long-term care centers should never be without an appropriate stockpile of PPE. We must make sure these facilities are better prepared to protect residents and staff as we face a second wave of COVID-19, and for future public health emergencies.""
Health care transparency
Murphy signed into law Sweeney's Health Care Transparency Act, which will create new identification requirements for health care professionals and set new regulations for audio and visual advertisements.
Under the new law, any advertisement of health care professionals would require the disclosure of the type of professional license and professional degree issued to the professional.
The law, S-2465/A-4143, will also require health care professionals to wear a name tag or identification during all in-person patient encounters. It must include their name, their professional license and degree, as well as a recent photograph if they are providing patient care at a hospital.
""Just as people deserve to know the food they buy or the cars they drive are safe and regulated, they deserve to know the medical treatments they are receiving are being performed by a qualified professional,"" said Sweeney. ""This is a 'truth in advertising' law for medical care and advice that is designed to ensure that health care providers clearly and honestly state their level of training, education and licensing.""
