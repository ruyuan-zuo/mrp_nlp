Statistics: Since October 21, 2020, the reported COVID cases in East Granby has increased from 19 cases to 27 cases or an increase of 42% in the past 8 days. For many months the Town positivity rate as measured by the Connecticut Department of Public Health has been a low 1.8%. Due to the recent uptick in cases, we have increased to 2.5% (28 reported cases divided by 1107 tests). Another measure that the State uses is the cases per 100,000 residents and they categorize towns as yellow (5-9 cases per 100,000 population) orange (10-14 cases per 100,000) or red for hotspots. Due to the recent spike, East Granby is barely at the yellow level with 9.7 cases per 100,000 and I anticipate that in the report to be released next week, we will escalate to the orange level.
What does this mean for East Granby Residents: Residents should continue to maintain CDC guidelines for frequent hand washing, wearing of masks and social distancing. Residents should also avoid larger events and limit group sizes. In light of Halloween and parties, please note that the State of Connecticut phase 3 guideline for private, social and recreational gathering sizes at private residences are limited to a maximum of 25 people and that fines of up to $500 can be issued to those not adhering to the State guidelines. Traditional ""Trick or Treating"" is a parental decision. Contactless candy distribution is encouraged. Some residents are putting tables of candy a the end of their driveways or on their porches. Social distancing and the wearing of masks is recommended.
Working together, we can continue to maintain the safety of East Granby residents and I thank you in advance for your help and cooperation as we fight back this recent surge in cases.

In addition to the presidential and congressional races, all state House of Representative and Senate seats are up for grabs. Voting will be different this year thanks to a law which allows absentee ballot voting for all voters in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
You can check your voting status on the Secretary of State's website, where you can also find your polling place.
There are several ways residents can vote:
Absentee Voting
The Secretary of the State office has mailed absentee ballot applications to all active registered voters in the state. Voters can also download the application online.
Those who want an absentee ballot will have to fill out the application and select a reason for requesting one. All voters are eligible to check the top box that lists ""COVID-19"" as a reason for requesting an absentee ballot.
Applications then need to be sent to the voter's local town clerk office. They can be dropped in the secure drop-off box in front of town hall, hand-delivered in person to the office or mailed in.
The applications will then be processed locally and will begin to be sent out Oct. 2.
Ballots must be completely filled out according to the accompanied instructions, including signing the inner envelope. Ballots can be hand-delivered to the town clerk office, placed in the drop-off box or mailed in. Ballots must be received by the close of polls in order to count.
Voting on Election Day
Polls in Connecticut are open 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day. You can use the Secretary of State's website to find your polling place.
Regular voter registration must be received or postmarked by the 7th day before Election Day. Registration can be done in person with the local registrar of voters office by the 7th day before an election.
Connecticut also allows for Election Day registration at designated centers in each town. People must be registered by 8 p.m. in order to vote using Election Day registration.

The bi-partisan group of State Representatives included Tom Delnicki (R-South Windsor), Kerry Wood (D-Wethersfield) Bill Simanski (R-Granby), Cristin McCarthy Vahey (D-Fairfield) and Kevin Ryan (D-Montville).
Rep. Zawistowski commented, ""Northern Connecticut is often overlooked when it comes to tourism and attractions. I was pleased to bring a group of legislators from different areas of the state to share what makes this site special and discuss the long effort to reopen New-Gate after being closed for nearly a decade. The state purchased the property in 1968 and it is one of four museums owned and operated by SHPO. Old New-Gate is now entering its second season of welcoming visitors.""
Old New-Gate Prison and Copper Mine is the oldest surviving state prison structure in the country and has been designated a National Historic Landmark and a State Archaeological Preserve. The site was first opened as a copper mine in 1705 and converted into a prison in 1773. After the state closed the prison in 1827, it became a local tourist attraction.

The Representatives were welcomed by Adjutant General of the Connecticut National Guard Major General Evon and the tour was conducted by 103rd Airlift Wing Commander Colonel Gwinn, and United States Air Force Master Sergeant Ewings.
""I was very impressed with the new facility that the Connecticut Air National Guard has up at Bradley.

This is truly a state-of-the-art facility that will help the Air National Guard and Air Force efficiently execute their missions.""
The nearly 16,000 square foot facility serves as a deployment processing center, air terminal and houses several logistics and readiness functions in one building. Small Air Terminal was federally funded as part of the 2017 fiscal year military construction program.
Rep. Zawistowski commented, ""I have so much respect and admiration for those who are willing to put their lives at risk to protect our freedom. It was good to see firsthand the important work that goes on at the base to support missions vital to our nation's protection.""

15,/connecticut/granby-eastgranby/letter-backing-chip-houlihan-judge-probate,2018-10-15T15:54:05Z,LETTER: Backing Chip Houlihan For Judge of Probate,0,0,Tim Jensen,Patch Staff,"I am a former Democratic Town Chair and State Central Committeeman and agree completely with the assessment that the office of Judge of Probate is routinely overlooked. Which is amazing to me because it is the the one office we need personally at the most vulnerable times of our lives! I'll bet more than 3/4 of the people who read this don't even know the name of their Judge of Probate!
Well this year some of us are extremely fortunate to have an outstanding endorsed Democrat, attorney Charles D. (Chip) Houlihan, Jr. of Simsbury running for election on November 6th, 2018. Chip is an excellent legal practitioner as well as a caring and compassionate human being and, if elected in our District (Avon, Canton, Granby and Simsbury) would, together with Hon. Evelyn Daly (Farmington and Burlington District) give the Farmington Valley probate services that would be the envy of the State of Connecticut!
I urge you to join with Matt and me in supporting Chip in every way we can to make sure he is indeed elected in November. Thank you.

18,/connecticut/granby-eastgranby/granby-state-senator-declines-run-u-s-congress-seat,2018-04-09T15:09:21Z,State Senator Declines Run for U.S. Congress Seat,0,0,Tim Jensen,Patch Staff,"GRANBY, CT — State Senator Kevin Witkos (R-8) announced Monday he has decided not to run for the 5th Congressional District seat that will be open following Democrat Elizabeth Esty's decision to not seek re-election in the wake of controversy that followed her dismissal of her former chief of staff amid allegations about threatening and harassing a former staff member.
Witkos currently serves the 8th Senate District in the Connecticut General Assembly in the role of Deputy Senate Republican President Pro Tempore. He said he intends to continue serving Connecticut's 8th Senate District and will be running for reelection to the State Senate in the upcoming November election.
""I love being a part of the Connecticut community,"" Witkos said in a written statement. ""It is my home, it's where I own a business, and it's where my wife and I raised our family. I deeply appreciate the encouragement and offers of assistance by many people throughout the state asking me to run as a candidate for the 5th Congressional District Seat representing Connecticut in Washington D.C. However, my heart and my commitment to Connecticut remains steadfast here at home.""
The 8th Senate District includes the communities of Avon, Barkhamsted, Canton, Colebrook, Granby, Hartland, Harwinton, New Hartford, Norfolk, Simsbury and Torrington.
""One of the greatest honors of my life has been to receive the support of my constituents to serve in the Connecticut State Senate,"" Witkos said. ""During my tenure, we have seen many changes in state government. I've had the pleasure of serving under three governors and numerous agency commissioners. During my time as a lawmaker I have worked to craft and pass legislation that has greatly benefited our state. Most recently, as a result of the historic tied membership in the State Senate, I was honored to be part of a momentous shift in which lawmakers were finally able to begin steering the state in the right direction fiscally. Last year we successfully adopted a bipartisan budget that contained a constitutional spending cap, a bond cap, a volatility cap and a requirement to vote on all union contracts – all policies lawmakers have long sought to implement for many years. While much has been accomplished, I believe there is still much more to do right here in Connecticut. That is why I believe at this time my place is not in Washington, but rather I belong right here in Connecticut where I hope to continue serving in the Connecticut State Senate, representing the 8th State Senate District and striving to make Connecticut an even better place to live, work and raise a family.""
