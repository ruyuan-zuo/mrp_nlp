Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that the state has dispersed more than $10 billion in unemployment insurance throughout the state since March 15, shortly before the state's COVID-19 coronavirus shelter-in-place order began.
Roughly 4.1 million California residents have received about $10.1 billion in unemployment insurance, including roughly 450,000 people who are self-employed.
""This is unprecedented in our state's history,"" Newsom said. ""These are numbers that no one thought they'd see in our lifetime.""
Newsom said he plans to work with the state Legislature to include more protections for self-employed and gig economy workers in the May revision of the state budget, which legislators must pass by June 15. For essential workers and workers whose businesses may open in the
next week as the state begins modifying its stay-at-home order, Newsom said the state has procured millions of protective masks and other items in recent weeks.
The state has dispersed some 14 million protective items and still has a stockpile of nearly 20 million items that are ready for use. The state has prioritized health care workers, first responders
and workers in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities for protective gear, but Newsom said grocery and retail workers will begin receiving protective items from the state very soon.
""I can assure you, all of these months, we have never had so many procedure masks, surgical masks in our possession, now able to be distributed all across the state of California,"" Newsom said.
The state is still planning to allow some low-risk businesses and industries to resume operations on Friday. However, Newsom chastised a handful of northern California counties who have announced their intentions to open higher-risk businesses such as hair salons and dine-in restaurants.
""They're making a big mistake,"" Newsom said of Yuba and Sutter counties. ""They're putting their public at risk, they're putting (the state's) progress at risk.""
Health officials around the state have confirmed a total of 56,212 coronavirus cases, including 2,317 deaths, according to Newsom. In addition, 1,157 people are in intensive care due to the virus and 3,369 are currently hospitalized across the state.

1,/california/novato/bill-seeks-data-how-coronavirus-impacts-lgbtq-community,2020-05-05T18:24:22Z,Bill Seeks Coronavirus Data For LGBTQ Community ,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, introduced a bill Tuesday requiring the state to collect data on how the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic affects the LGBTQ community.
Currently, the state collects coronavirus case, death and hospitalization data by race and ethnicity, age and gender but not by sexuality. Wiener's bill, Senate Bill 932, would require the state to begin
collecting virus data on the LGBTQ community to understand how the virus
affects it.
Wiener suggested that LGBTQ people could be suffering more from the virus because the community has higher rates of cancer, HIV and AIDS, respiratory issues due to smoking, homelessness and youth homelessness.
The data collection, Wiener said, would also demonstrate the state government's support for the LGBTQ community, which has been routinely neglected by state and local governments, most notably during the HIV and AIDS crisis in the 1980s.
""We know that COVID-19 is harming the LGBTQ community, but because no data is being collected, we're hamstrung in making the case to devote attention and resources,"" Wiener said. ""The history of the LGBTQ community is a history of fighting against invisibility. Without data, we quickly become an invisible community and risk being erased.""
Equality California is sponsoring the bill, according to Wiener's office. Wiener did not give an estimated date of when the state Legislature could begin discussing the bill. The Legislature reconvened Monday for the first time since mid-March after the pandemic upended the
legislative session. In the coming weeks, state lawmakers will also be required to juggle the pandemic response and the state budget, which must be approved by June 15.

For the first time, California is part of Super Tuesday, when presidential primaries will take place in more than a dozen states. In the past, the Golden State's primary was held in June, when the nominees for both major parties are typically already decided.
There are 20.4 million registered voters in the state, an increase of 3.1 million since the last presidential election in 2016. In fact, 80 percent of eligible Californians are registered to vote, the highest heading into a presidential primary in California in the past 68 years.
A total of 166,260 people are registered to vote in Marin, according to the latest voter registration numbers from Secretary of State Alex Padilla's office. That's nearly 92 percent of eligible voters.
""California entered 2020 with a record 20.4 million registered voters — and I only expect that figure to climb as we reach the presidential primary in March and general election in November,"" Padilla said.
The statewide races dominating the headlines in California are those for the presidential primary and Proposition 13, the only statewide measure on the ballot. Proposition 13 asks voters to authorize the sale of $15 billion in bonds to fund facility improvements at schools from pre-K to public universities.
In Marin County, voters will also weigh in on various local measures and races for city and town councils, the Board of Supervisors, State Assembly and U.S. Congress.
In the 2nd Congressional District, incumbent Democrat Jared Huffman is facing Democrat Rachel Moniz, Republican Dale K. Mensing, Green Party candidate Melissa Bradley and American Independent Party candidate Charles ""Wally"" Coppock. The district spans the North Coast of the state, from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon border, and includes Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity and Del Norte counties.
In the 10th Assembly District, incumbent Democrat Marc Levine is facing Democrats Ted Cabral and Veronica ""Roni"" Jacobi and Republican Ron Sondergaard. The district encompasses all of Marin County and some of Sonoma County.
In District 2, Supervisor Katie Rice is running unopposed.
In District 3, Bill Bailey, Jack Kenney and Stephanie Moulton-Peters are competing for the open seat. Supervisor Kate Sears is retiring.
In District 4, Supervisor Dennis Rodoni is facing challenger Alex Easton-Brown.
Elections are being held for the Corte Madera Town Council, Mill Valley City Council, Ross Town Council and Tiburon Town Council.
There are 10 local measures in Marin County. Read more here.
Here are some of the issues facing Novato voters:
Novato Unified School District Measure A
Measure A would add $125 to the current $251 per parcel rate. The measure includes 3 percent annual inflation adjustments. The total parcel tax amount would be $376 annually, raising $6 million per year for 8 years. Funds would be used to attract and retain teachers; protect the quality of academic instruction in core subjects; protect music, art and athletic programs; expand mental health counseling services; provide career and technical training; and minimize increases to class sizes.
Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority Measure C
Measure C would levy an annual special tax to fund Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority, a new wildfire prevention agency formed by 17 fire protection agencies in the county that represent more than 98 percent of the land and more than 96 percent of the residents of Marin.
The annual tax would be up to 10 cents per square foot for improved commercial and residential parcels. The tax would be $75 per unit for multifamily residential structures with three or more units, and $25, $100 or $150 per unimproved parcels based on acreage.
The tax would raise approximately $19.3 million annually for wildfire prevention in the county.
San Geronimo Valley Golf Course Measure D
Measure D would amend the San Geronimo Valley Community Plan and the Marin County Development Code to require voter approval for any change in the primary golf course use of the San Geronimo Valley Golf Course property. The measure would also require the county to prepare economic and environmental analyses of proposed changes.
Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit District Measure I
Measure I would extend an existing quarter-cent sales tax to help finance the operations of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit District's commuter train for an additional 30 years. The tax was first approved by voters in Marin and Sonoma counties in 2008 and generates around $40 million annually for SMART.

The Yes on C group says the measure will improve emergency alert and warning systems, improve evacuation routes and infrastructure for quicker evacuations, reduce hazardous vegetation and expand defensible space and fire safety inspections.
The Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority, comprised of 17 public agencies responsible for fire services, supports the measure that requires two-thirds approval. Proponents say the county needs a coordinated program for proactive wildfire prevention and preparedness.
The Coalition of Sensible Taxpayers, CO$T, initially opposed the measure because the tax had no expiration, but now supports Measure C. The Marin Conservation League and fireSAFEMARIN also support Measure C.
The Marin Public Policy Institute opposes the measure. Treasurer Michael Hartnett believes the threat of wildfires in Marin County are being exploited to raise taxes for unfounded pensions, and the Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority is a bureaucracy unaccountable to voters.
Hartnett said the unnecessary tax likely will become permanent within five years and there is ample revenue from existing taxes for removing vegetation and evacuation routes.
The Marin Public Policy Institute says competent traffic managers have already established evacuation routes without the need for a $19 million a year tax to burdening taxpayers.
The Tiburon Fire Protection District and the City of Belvedere elected not to join the Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority because they receive revenue for fire services from a local tax.

Cunningham has more than 20 years of local government finance experience working for the cities of Dublin, Moraga, Walnut Creek and Half Moon Bay. Much of her work has focused on strengthening the fiscal stability of cities and increasing transparency to the public, according to Novato city officials.
As finance director, Cunningham will oversee the city's budget preparation, financial reporting, general accounting, purchasing, payroll, debt administration, and management of revenue and invested funds.
""Amy brings a tremendous amount of financial and budgeting expertise to Novato,"" City Manager Adam McGill said. ""I look forward to her leadership as we strengthen our finance department and continue to build trust with our community.""

She has served as a board member for the Municipal Management Association of Northern California and served as co-chair of the Preparing the Next Generation initiative for the state affiliate of the International City/County Management Association, Cal-ICMA.

9,/california/novato/marin-offer-affordable-housing-incentives-property-owners,2020-01-20T17:52:13Z,Marin To Offer Affordable Housing Incentives,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"MARIN COUNTY, CA — Bay Area cities continue the process of updating their local ordinances governing ""accessory dwelling units"" to conform to new state laws that give cities less control over what they allow.
City councils in Walnut Creek and Piedmont are set to address the issue at their respective meetings Tuesday night.
Changes being considered in these two cities and elsewhere come via several bills signed in October by Gov. Gavin Newsom meant to increase affordable housing stocks statewide. ADUs, sometimes called ""mother-in-law"" units or ""granny flats,"" are one part of the state's ideal formula for providing more such housing.
One new law, AB 68/AB 881, will limit cities' ability to prevent homeowners from building second and third units less than 16 feet tall provided there is enough space to build them at least four feet from property lines. It also prohibits replacement off-street parking when a ""garage, carport or covered parking structure"" is demolished or converted into an ADU.
Walnut Creek planners say the new state laws ""would have nullified the entirety"" of that city's existing zoning regulations for ADUs, because some of its provisions conflicted with those in the new state law. The City Council on Dec. 17 adopted an urgency ordinance that removed these conflicting provisions, but further action is needed to comply with state law.
Between a significant update of Walnut Creek ADU regulations in 2017, and the new state law that ""leaves very little else for the city to regulate in regards to ADUs,"" the City Council is being urged to make its urgency ordinance permanent over the next several months.
The Piedmont City Council is set to take up the issue at its Tuesday meeting, and is poised to implement the proposed ordinance changes. On Jan. 13, the Piedmont Planning Commission voted to recommend updates to the city's ordinance regulating ADUs to bring the city's ordinance in line with the new state laws. Saying they felt their hands, and the city's hands, are tied by the new state laws, commissioners voted to recommend updates to the city's ordinance regulating ADUs that give the city less autonomy in regulating these units.
Meanwhile, Marin County is offering new financial breaks for property owners in unincorporated parts of that county to create affordable rental units on their properties.
Under this program overseen by the Marin County Community Development Agency, property owners renting ADUs to tenants with household income of less than 80 percent of the local median will have as much as $10,000 in permit fees waived, and smaller breaks as the tenants' incomes rise. The financial incentives are extended to cover fines or fees for property owners rehabilitating existing units or legalizing unpermitted ones.
The new local rules are retroactive to Jan. 1 and are valid through Dec. 31.
The Walnut Creek City Council meeting begins at 6 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall, 1666 N. Main St. The Piedmont City Council meeting begins at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 120 Vista.

The jobs are mainly for clerical and census-taker positions, but also include a few supervisory and recruitment outreach positions.
In Marin County, 2020 Census jobs pay $25 an hour, according to an interactive map from the Census Bureau. Census-takers are eligible for reimbursement for work-related mileage and other expenses.
Completing the census is one of the best things you can do for California, Marin County and Novato.
An accurate population helps determine policy and the allocation of funds at every level of government. It is used to determine the number and boundaries of congressional districts, state legislative districts, county board and city council seats in California, but also how big a share local governments get of the $675 billion in federal program funds for communities, schools, roads, hospitals and other services.
Businesses use the information to decide where to build new factories, shopping centers, banks, offices and attractions.
Preference for the temporary Census Bureau jobs is given to U.S. armed services veterans who were honorably discharged. But jobs are open to U.S. citizens 18 and older with proof of a valid Social Security number and registration with the U.S. Selective Service System. Among other conditions of employment, applicants must pass a Census-performed criminal background check.
Most jobs require the applicant to have a valid driver's license, unless public transportation is available. All applicants must have an email account and access to a computer and internet.
Most jobs will last several weeks, though it depends on the amount of available work. Hours are flexible, though some require daytime work so addresses on buildings are clearly visible. Census-takers doing personal interviews must be available to work evenings and weekends, when people are usually at home. Those in supervisory positions must be available for certain day, evening and weekend shifts.
Applicants must provide their Social Security number, home address, email address, phone number, and date and place of birth. Veterans who are claiming preference will have to submit documentation for eligibility.
It will take about 30 minutes to apply online for Census jobs.
Positions are open across the country, but the Census Bureau is committed to hiring people to work in the areas where they live because they are likely familiar with the people and places in a community.
More information about positions in our area is available by calling the Census Bureau at 855-JOB-2020 (855-562-2020) and selecting option 3. You may also use the Federal Relay Service at 800-877-8339 for TTY/ASCII."

But you can still cast or hand off your ballot in person this year — and you can do it early or on Election Day.
Dubbed ""vote centers"" rather than ""polling places,"" physical voting locations will also be a bit different than in years past.
The amount of in-person polling places in California will be limited compared to previous elections, in accordance with a law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in August, but some vote centers already opened up as early as Oct. 24.
Centers are required to remain open Saturday through Monday Nov. 2 for at least eight hours each day and from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Although every registered and active voter in California was already mailed a ballot in October, polling places will still be open for same day voter registration, for those who need assistance with language or disabilities — or for those who simply want to witness the historic election day unfold.
In Novato, five vote centers are slated to open Saturday:

All of these changes to voting in California this year are to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Vote center volunteers and employees are required to space voting booths apart, sanitize surfaces and encourage those waiting in line to socially distance.
Voters are encouraged to arrive with a face covering, but those who show up without will be provided one.

21,/california/novato/novato-voters-approve-hotel-tax-hike,2020-11-04T16:48:10Z,​Novato Voters Approve Hotel Tax Hike,0,0,Bay City News,News Partner,"NOVATO, CA — Novato residents Tuesday appeared to favor, by a three-to-one margin, a ballot measure that would increase the city's hotel tax by 2 percent.
With all 13 of the city's precincts reporting, slightly more than 77 percent of Novato voters favored the ""transient occupancy tax"" increase.
The city's current transient occupancy tax is 10 percent of a hotel guest's room rate and has remained unchanged since 1997.
The 2 percent hotel tax increase would provide an additional $400,000 in annual tax revenue, according to city officials.
Novato collected $1.82 million in hotel tax revenue during the 2019-2020 fiscal year but is projected to collect only $1.45 million during the 2020-2021 fiscal year.
City officials estimate the tax increase could boost hotel tax revenue by $400,000 in its first 12 months. All hotel tax funding is used to fund local expenditures like infrastructure repairs, emergency response services and recovery efforts from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Elsewhere in Marin County, San Rafael voters appeared poised to approve a quarter-cent sales tax increase over nine years that is estimated to generate some $3.4 million per year for services like street repairs, disaster preparedness and park maintenance.
Just over 62 percent of San Rafael voters approved of the measure, according to the county's unofficial election results.
The measure's approval would nudge the city's sales tax rate to 9.25 percent. All sales tax revenue would be placed in the city's general fund, according to San Rafael City Attorney Robert Epstein.
Unofficial results also showed Marin County voters overwhelmingly supporting three school district funding measures, including a pair of parcel tax extensions.
The Shoreline Unified School District's Measure L, which would extend a $212 per parcel tax for eight years, had roughly 84 percent support from voters with both of the district's precincts reporting.
Measure M, which would extend the Tamalpais Union High School District's $469 annual per parcel tax for nine years, had nearly 74 percent support, according to unofficial results from the district's 57 precincts.
Some 77 percent of voters in the Sausalito Marin City School District appeared to support a measure that would authorize the district to issue $41.6 million in bonds, which district officials said will fund the construction and modernization of classrooms and upgrades to the district's libraries and science labs, among other things.
Marin County election officials have reported 101,111 ballots cast as of Tuesday night. Approximate 58 percent of the county's registered voters cast a ballot, according to the county.
