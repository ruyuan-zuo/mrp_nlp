That's why at Social Security, we are constantly improving our online resources to make doing business with us easier and faster.
With a my Social Security account, those receiving benefits can change their address and direct deposit information; get proof of their benefits; and request replacement documents, like a Medicare card. If you aren't currently getting benefits, you can check your earnings record, get estimates of your future benefits, and view your Social Security Statement. In many states, you can even request a replacement Social Security card online. See everything you can do with a my Social Security account and open one today at www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount."

Having a partner not only means creating a family unit, it means sharing things like a home and other property. Understanding how your future retirement might affect your spouse is important. When you're planning for your retirement, here are a few things to remember:
Your spouse's benefit amount could be up to 50 percent of your spouse's full retirement age amount, if you are full retirement age when you take it. If you qualify for a benefit from your own work history and a spouse's record, we always pay your own benefit first. You cannot receive spouse's benefits unless your spouse is receiving his or her retirement benefits (except for divorced spouses). If you took your reduced retirement first while waiting for your spouse to reach retirement age, when you add spouse's benefits later, your own retirement portion remains reduced, which causes the total retirement and spouses benefit together to total less than 50 percent of the worker's amount. You can find out more about this at www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html.
On the other hand, if your spouse's retirement benefit is higher than your retirement benefit, and he or she chooses to take reduced benefits and dies first, your survivor benefit will be reduced, but may be higher than what your spouse received."

Both programs help safeguard millions of Americans as well as improve the quality of life for their family and friends. While Social Security offers retirement, disability, and survivors benefits, Medicare provides health insurance.
Medicare is our country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older and younger people receiving Social Security disability benefits. The program helps with the cost of health care, but it doesn't cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care.
When you first enroll in Medicare and during certain times of the year, you can choose how you get your Medicare coverage. There are 2 main ways to get Medicare:
Original Medicare
Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). If you want drug coverage, you can join a separate Part D plan. To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medicare (like your deductible and 20% coinsurance), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage. Examples include coverage from a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy, or from a former employer or union.
Medicare Advantage (also known as Part C)

Medicare Advantage is an ""all in one"" alternative to Original Medicare. These ""bundled"" plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. Part C plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. They also may offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover â€” like vision, hearing, dental, and more.
If you can't afford to pay your Medicare premiums and other medical costs, you may be able to get help from your state. States offer programs for people eligible for or entitled to Medicare who have low income. Some programs may pay for Medicare premiums and some pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance. To qualify, you must have limited income and resources."

The earlier young workers know about saving for their future, the better chance they'll have at achieving a comfortable retirement. This is why Social Security has created a resource specifically for teachers and students.

Our Information for Educators page contains a toolkit with information and resources to educate and engage students on Social Security programs and services. Within the toolkit, you'll find:

It's important for students to understand why Social Security was created and why it is essential to their lives today and in the future. This knowledge and understanding will provide students a strong base on which to build their financial future.
You can access the webpage and toolkit at www.socialsecurity.gov/thirdparty/educators.html.
Young workers can also see how Social Security directly relates to them at www.socialsecurity.gov/people/students.
Encouraging young people to save now for long-term goals that are decades away can be somewhat difficult. Let them know they have a better chance of realizing their dreams if they start planning and taking action early. And also let them know that they can share this information with friends, both in person and on social media."

During the course of the 2016 legislative session the Missouri General Assembly tackled several important issues designed to improve the state's criminal justice system. These are issues that received a great deal of discussion and debate, and were thoroughly vetted throughout the legislative process. Whether it is taking steps to shut down human traffickers in the state, or giving Missourians with minor offenses a second chance, the legislature made some positive steps forward this year that will make a substantive difference in the lives of many Missourians. Listed below are brief descriptions of several of the bills that are now law, or soon will be.
This year the legislature took action to enact legislation to combat sex trafficking and protect the victims of these crimes. While it's hard for some to believe that a form of slavery exists in modern times, human trafficking is all too real and a problem that has grown into a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. Each year, thousands of men, women, and children in the United States are exploited and forced into prostitution.

House Bill 1562 helps to fight sex traffickers by expanding the crime to include the act of advertising the availability of a minor or non-consenting adult for prostitution or pornography.
Currently, Missouri law does not comprehensively address advertising the availability of another person for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The goal of the bill is to shut down the internet sites that are used to help traffickers find buyers.

House Bill 1562 also includes two provisions to strengthen the protections provided through the Safe at Home Program. The program provides victims of sexual and domestic violence with a substitute address so that their actual physical address can remain confidential and inaccessible to their abusers. House Bill 1562 enhances the penalties for attempting to access the address of a participant in the Safe at Home Program. It also adds victims of human trafficking to the list of eligible participants.

In addition, House Bill 1562 limits the disclosure of related photographs and records to individuals who are part of an investigation or judicial proceeding. The goal with this change is to protect the confidentiality of children who are the victims of sexual offenses

The provisions of the bill become law on August 28."

Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per weekâ€”or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data setâ€”Iowaâ€”and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

The outer road would switch to westbound between Shady Springs Road and Mid Rivers Mall Drive and eastbound between Mid Rivers Mall Drive to where Mexico Road meets Veterans Memorial Parkway. 

Plans for the access changes to I-70 will be presented for public comment from 4 to 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at St. Peters City Hall. 

Russ Batzel, manager of the transportation and development services group for St. Peters, said the new plans incorporate changes suggested by businesses and the public at the last hearing, held a year ago.

""A year ago, what we heard was close to 90 percent of the people recognize there was a problem with congestion at 70 and at the interchanges at Mid Rivers and Cave Springs. A similar percentage felt the project was beneficial or somewhat beneficial to the traveling public,"" Batzel said. 

The challenge was to find a way to provide access to the various types of businesses that are located in the three-mile stretch along the corridor. Those businesses include big box stores like Costco, Mid Rivers Mall and hhgregg, car dealerships and smaller businesses. 

""The businesses were a little more skeptical,"" Batzel said. ""We've done things to address that by reconfiguring ramps and access."" 

The city added access from the outer road on both north and south to 70 and to 370. Previous plans did not have access to 370.

In the updated plan, drivers heading westbound on the north outer road would be able to get onto 370 and drivers coming off of 370 could get straight onto the outer road heading west. 

There are on-ramps to I-70 from northbound outer road planned at just past Executive Center Parkway, at 370 and at Mid Rivers Mall Drive.

Heading east on Veterans Memorial Parkway from Mid Rivers Mall Drive, drivers will be able to access 370 and also get on to I-70 at Executive Center Parkway and both right before and right after Cave Springs. 

The public is invited to give comments on the new plans, which would be incorporated into an access justification report for review by the Missouri Department of Transportation. The city hopes to receive approval and look to start construction at the end of 2014 into 2015. 

""We're generally trying to find a way to plan this for the betterment of hte community and access to the community, and again trying to consider every viewpoint,"" Batzel said. 

The estimated cost for the project has risen to between $12 and $15 million, Batzel said. Funding would come from a range of sources. "

The St. Peters Board of Aldermen approved St. Charles Tower's application for a special use permit for the tower on a 6-2 vote with Aldermen Tommy Roberts, Ward 3, and Judy Bateman, Ward 2, voting no. 

Alderman Jerry Hollingsworth, Ward 2, was the only Alderman to speak on the issue.

He said he was disappointed that locally-elected State Representatives supported a law that limits the ability of municipalities to impose certain regulations or requirements on the tower. 

House Bill 331 prohibits municipalities from imposing requirements or obligations about the appearance of facilities that are unreasonable, or rejecting a application based on perceived environmental effects of radio frequency emissions. 

The law took effect Aug. 28. 

""I will have to vote yes,"" he said. ""The courts are backing them up.""

St. Charles City Council President Dave Beckering plans to introduce a bill that would mandate the signage at the council meeting Sept. 24. He said all ten council members have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. 

Beckering said signs ensure everyone knows whether smoking is available before they go in. 

""I think it's reasonable from the perspective that this way, let's say you are a parent or grandparent of a young child, you know before you walk in the door whether it's smoking or not,"" he said. 

Signs would have to be posted at every entrance to the business that say either smoking is permitted or smoking is prohibited. The sign must have letters no smaller than 1 inch in height and would have to be posted by Jan. 1, 2014. 

Violating the law would result in a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment up to 3 months. 

Beckering proposed the bill after the city council dropped plans to consider a city-wide smoking ban earlier this year. 

The city held three town hall meetings on the issue and only received feedback from 102 people, 55 of which were opposed to any sort of smoking ban. Forty-four people were in favor of a ban. 

""We couldn't tell what they wanted to do,"" he said. ""There's certainly no consensus.""

St. Charles County Councilman Mike Klinghammer, a former member of the St. Charles City Council, is watching to see how the sign ordinance is received.

He spoke during a recent discussion of a proposed countywide smoking ban except in places that are limited to people ages 21 and older. Klinghammer is opposed to a smoking ban, but said the steps St. Charles is taking could be helpful. "

This is the second time that St. Charles Tower, Inc. has applied to place the tower on the vegetable seller's property, which is adjacent to residential neighborhood and a childcare center. 

The application did not receive enough votes from the board to win approval last time. 

City staff members wrote in a report that the request is reasonable because it's in a commercial location that fronts a major roadway and the tower would be screened by a fence and landscape buffer. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission disagreed with one aspect of the staff's report and amended it to read that the proposed tower cannot function in that location without a negative impact on the area. 

The Commission then voted on July 25 to unanimously recommend the Board of Aldermen deny the request for a permit.

In the long term, the plan is to extend the trail from the club house, under Interstate 70 to Old Town St. Peters. From there, a spur connection would link the trail to the Salt River Road. The extension is being funded by Great Rivers Greenway.

Great Rivers Greenway will present design plans for the new portion of the trail at a public meeting set from 4-6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 10 at the St. Peters Golf Course. 

The one-mile addition to the trail is expected to follow the perimeter of the golf course on the west side, said Jeff Hutsler. The trail is designed to keep the interaction between the trail users and golf carts at a minimum, he said. 

Some tee boxes will be moved and elevated and portions of the golf cart path moved closer to the pins.

""Some of the improvements that we're doing because of the trail going through there will actually enhance the game,"" Hutsler said. 

Great Rivers Greenway will consider comments made by the public Tuesday and make design recommendations to the Board of Aldermen, who would have to approve plans. From there, the engineering for the project is expected to be done in 2014 and the trail build out done in 2015.

County Councilman Joe Cronin, R-St. Paul, introduced a bill Monday that would ban smoking in public and enclosed places except for those that are only open to people and employees age 21 and older. The gambling areas of Ameristar Casino would be exempted under the ban along with most bars in St. Charles County. 
The ban would apply to all parts of the county, but municipalities could enact more stringent laws. Currently O'Fallon and Lake Saint Louis have smoking bans. 
Cronin has tried several times to get a smoking ban passed. The most recent effort, which would have put two propositions before voters last November, was thrown out by a judge for procedural reasons. An ordinance passed by the County Council in 2011 was vetoed by County Executive Steve Ehlmann. 
This bill was crafted as a compromise, Cronin said, and doesn't even make the proponents of a smoking ban happy because it doesn't go far enough. He said his goal is to protect children from secondhand smoke. 
""I want to make the county a healthier place while preserving business rights,"" he said. 
Councilman Mike Elam questioned where the County would draw the line after enacting this ban. He wondered whether the county would eventually try to ban things like alcohol or Happy Meals. 
""I think it comes down to you know whether or not they smoke in there, i think if you don't want to eat at a place or drink at a place that has smoking, you turn around and walk out,"" he said. 
Councilman Joe Brazil also opposes the proposal. 
Councilman Terry Hollander, who supported Cronin's previous bills, said he believes the smoking ban should go before voters because it contains restrictions. 
""It's one of the things we've pretty much insinuated for the past two years that if anything did come from us, it would be with the idea that the people have the opportunity to weigh in and vote,"" he said. 
Councilman John White also supports putting the matter before voters. He said businesses have thrived in places where smoking bans have been put into place.

The St. Peters Board of Alderman failed to approve the application for a special use permit at the July 25 meeting, with three voting in favor, three opposed and two absent. 

The company is coming back to the city just days after a new state law took effect which limits the ability of local municipalities to regulate locations of cell towers. 

Gov. Jay Nixon signed HB 331 into law in July. The legislation was opposed by the Missouri Municipal League and supported by AT&T. 

St. Charles Tower Attorney Eric Martin asked the Planning and Zoning Commission to again consider the application to place the tower at Anthony's Produce. 

He said that St. Charles Tower had already had two lengthy public hearings on the issue to find ways to meet concerns of the public, including moving the tower further away from a childcare center. 

""We wish to present this to the Board of Aldermen gain with all members present,"" he said. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission on Sept. 4 voted to recommend the Board of Alderman vote down the special use permit. Planning and Zoning Commissioner Keith McNames suggested that the tower would have a negative impact on the surrounding area. 

Shirley Michael, 81, spoke out again against the proposal during the public hearing Wednesday and against the new state law. Michaels said no one wants to live that close to a 90-foot cell tower. Her property backs Anthony's Produce. 

""We won July the 25, 2013 at the Alderman meeting. We felt good that we had our chance, that we were listened to. We had got our word out about what's happening behind closed doors. It doesn't pass the smell test. We have to stand up for our rights,"" she said.  

Before the commissioners voted, McNames suggested St. Charles Tower consider placing the tower in the parking lot across Jungermann Road from Anthony's Produce. He also suggested a few different places on the Anthony's Produce property. 

""I know St. Charles Tower wants to be a good neighbor to the community and a good neighbor to the residents, if you've got a quarter mile, a half mile, you ought to take a look at it.""

Martin asked the commission to consider the current application. He said the company would be willing to locate the tower wherever the city wanted on the property.  "
19,/missouri/stpeters/police-target-code-violations-across-city,2013-08-29T16:20:42Z,Police Target Code Violations Across City,0,0,Kalen Ponche,Patch Staff,"Residents with an inoperable car parked in the driveway, or who left their business vehicle parked in the street likely received a warning letter from the city of St. Peters recently.

The police department earlier this summer completed a city-wide sweep looking for violations of vehicle codes. Residents who had a violation were mailed a warning letter Aug. 12 and asked to come into compliance.

St. Peters Police Officer Melissa Doss said the department conducts these proactive sweeps periodically; the last one was four or five years ago.

Officers drive every street of every neighborhood and when they see violations, fill out a form. The ordinance officer then checks back to see if the problems have been corrected; if they haven't he sends another warning letter, Doss said.

Residents have ample opportunity to correct the violation, she added.
Still, at least one resident has questioned the tactic and the need to ticket vehicles that are in good condition sitting in driveways, but are not licensed.

Patch reader Aaron Heger posted a concern about the ordinance on the Patch boards. He wrote that his truck had been cited because he hadn't had time to fix the problem that prevented it from passing a safety inspection.
""I'm astounded that we, as a society, can nit pick at things like this, with all the other problems we face.

So, the city wants me to junk my truck because I can't fix it right away, which will cause me to incur a much higher expense later down the road, when I have to buy another truck. 

Am I completely out of line by thinking I should be allowed a little more discretion over the private property that I own?"" Heger wrote.
Doss said often people don't think about what would happen if every resident had a derelict vehicle.

""People would be up in arms,"" she said. ""If every single person had an RV in their yard, our property values would drop dramatically. The people who are complaining are the ones who want to be the only ones who would have a derelict vehicle.""

Normally, the Police Department has one officer assigned to ordinance enforcement full time, Doss said. She said he typically has less than 100 vehicle ordinance violations in a year.

If residents spot violations, concerns can be reported to the Citizen Action Center at (636) 477-6600. Callers will receive a response of some kind withing 72 hours and can track the progress on the complaint.

Having a partner not only means creating a family unit, it means sharing things like a home and other property. Understanding how your future retirement might affect your spouse is important. When you're planning for your retirement, here are a few things to remember:
Your spouse's benefit amount could be up to 50 percent of your spouse's full retirement age amount, if you are full retirement age when you take it. If you qualify for a benefit from your own work history and a spouse's record, we always pay your own benefit first. You cannot receive spouse's benefits unless your spouse is receiving his or her retirement benefits (except for divorced spouses). If you took your reduced retirement first while waiting for your spouse to reach retirement age, when you add spouse's benefits later, your own retirement portion remains reduced, which causes the total retirement and spouses benefit together to total less than 50 percent of the worker's amount. You can find out more about this at www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html.
On the other hand, if your spouse's retirement benefit is higher than your retirement benefit, and he or she chooses to take reduced benefits and dies first, your survivor benefit will be reduced, but may be higher than what your spouse received."

Both programs help safeguard millions of Americans as well as improve the quality of life for their family and friends. While Social Security offers retirement, disability, and survivors benefits, Medicare provides health insurance.
Medicare is our country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older and younger people receiving Social Security disability benefits. The program helps with the cost of health care, but it doesn't cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care.
When you first enroll in Medicare and during certain times of the year, you can choose how you get your Medicare coverage. There are 2 main ways to get Medicare:
Original Medicare
Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). If you want drug coverage, you can join a separate Part D plan. To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medicare (like your deductible and 20% coinsurance), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage. Examples include coverage from a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy, or from a former employer or union.
Medicare Advantage (also known as Part C)

Medicare Advantage is an ""all in one"" alternative to Original Medicare. These ""bundled"" plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. Part C plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. They also may offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover â€” like vision, hearing, dental, and more.
If you can't afford to pay your Medicare premiums and other medical costs, you may be able to get help from your state. States offer programs for people eligible for or entitled to Medicare who have low income. Some programs may pay for Medicare premiums and some pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance. To qualify, you must have limited income and resources."

During the course of the 2016 legislative session the Missouri General Assembly tackled several important issues designed to improve the state's criminal justice system. These are issues that received a great deal of discussion and debate, and were thoroughly vetted throughout the legislative process. Whether it is taking steps to shut down human traffickers in the state, or giving Missourians with minor offenses a second chance, the legislature made some positive steps forward this year that will make a substantive difference in the lives of many Missourians. Listed below are brief descriptions of several of the bills that are now law, or soon will be.
This year the legislature took action to enact legislation to combat sex trafficking and protect the victims of these crimes. While it's hard for some to believe that a form of slavery exists in modern times, human trafficking is all too real and a problem that has grown into a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. Each year, thousands of men, women, and children in the United States are exploited and forced into prostitution.

House Bill 1562 helps to fight sex traffickers by expanding the crime to include the act of advertising the availability of a minor or non-consenting adult for prostitution or pornography.
Currently, Missouri law does not comprehensively address advertising the availability of another person for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The goal of the bill is to shut down the internet sites that are used to help traffickers find buyers.

House Bill 1562 also includes two provisions to strengthen the protections provided through the Safe at Home Program. The program provides victims of sexual and domestic violence with a substitute address so that their actual physical address can remain confidential and inaccessible to their abusers. House Bill 1562 enhances the penalties for attempting to access the address of a participant in the Safe at Home Program. It also adds victims of human trafficking to the list of eligible participants.

In addition, House Bill 1562 limits the disclosure of related photographs and records to individuals who are part of an investigation or judicial proceeding. The goal with this change is to protect the confidentiality of children who are the victims of sexual offenses

The provisions of the bill become law on August 28."

Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per weekâ€”or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data setâ€”Iowaâ€”and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

The outer road would switch to westbound between Shady Springs Road and Mid Rivers Mall Drive and eastbound between Mid Rivers Mall Drive to where Mexico Road meets Veterans Memorial Parkway. 

Plans for the access changes to I-70 will be presented for public comment from 4 to 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at St. Peters City Hall. 

Russ Batzel, manager of the transportation and development services group for St. Peters, said the new plans incorporate changes suggested by businesses and the public at the last hearing, held a year ago.

""A year ago, what we heard was close to 90 percent of the people recognize there was a problem with congestion at 70 and at the interchanges at Mid Rivers and Cave Springs. A similar percentage felt the project was beneficial or somewhat beneficial to the traveling public,"" Batzel said. 

The challenge was to find a way to provide access to the various types of businesses that are located in the three-mile stretch along the corridor. Those businesses include big box stores like Costco, Mid Rivers Mall and hhgregg, car dealerships and smaller businesses. 

""The businesses were a little more skeptical,"" Batzel said. ""We've done things to address that by reconfiguring ramps and access."" 

The city added access from the outer road on both north and south to 70 and to 370. Previous plans did not have access to 370.

In the updated plan, drivers heading westbound on the north outer road would be able to get onto 370 and drivers coming off of 370 could get straight onto the outer road heading west. 

There are on-ramps to I-70 from northbound outer road planned at just past Executive Center Parkway, at 370 and at Mid Rivers Mall Drive.

Heading east on Veterans Memorial Parkway from Mid Rivers Mall Drive, drivers will be able to access 370 and also get on to I-70 at Executive Center Parkway and both right before and right after Cave Springs. 

The public is invited to give comments on the new plans, which would be incorporated into an access justification report for review by the Missouri Department of Transportation. The city hopes to receive approval and look to start construction at the end of 2014 into 2015. 

""We're generally trying to find a way to plan this for the betterment of hte community and access to the community, and again trying to consider every viewpoint,"" Batzel said. 

The estimated cost for the project has risen to between $12 and $15 million, Batzel said. Funding would come from a range of sources. "

The St. Peters Board of Aldermen approved St. Charles Tower's application for a special use permit for the tower on a 6-2 vote with Aldermen Tommy Roberts, Ward 3, and Judy Bateman, Ward 2, voting no. 

Alderman Jerry Hollingsworth, Ward 2, was the only Alderman to speak on the issue.

He said he was disappointed that locally-elected State Representatives supported a law that limits the ability of municipalities to impose certain regulations or requirements on the tower. 

House Bill 331 prohibits municipalities from imposing requirements or obligations about the appearance of facilities that are unreasonable, or rejecting a application based on perceived environmental effects of radio frequency emissions. 

The law took effect Aug. 28. 

""I will have to vote yes,"" he said. ""The courts are backing them up.""

St. Charles City Council President Dave Beckering plans to introduce a bill that would mandate the signage at the council meeting Sept. 24. He said all ten council members have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. 

Beckering said signs ensure everyone knows whether smoking is available before they go in. 

""I think it's reasonable from the perspective that this way, let's say you are a parent or grandparent of a young child, you know before you walk in the door whether it's smoking or not,"" he said. 

Signs would have to be posted at every entrance to the business that say either smoking is permitted or smoking is prohibited. The sign must have letters no smaller than 1 inch in height and would have to be posted by Jan. 1, 2014. 

Violating the law would result in a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment up to 3 months. 

Beckering proposed the bill after the city council dropped plans to consider a city-wide smoking ban earlier this year. 

The city held three town hall meetings on the issue and only received feedback from 102 people, 55 of which were opposed to any sort of smoking ban. Forty-four people were in favor of a ban. 

""We couldn't tell what they wanted to do,"" he said. ""There's certainly no consensus.""

St. Charles County Councilman Mike Klinghammer, a former member of the St. Charles City Council, is watching to see how the sign ordinance is received.

He spoke during a recent discussion of a proposed countywide smoking ban except in places that are limited to people ages 21 and older. Klinghammer is opposed to a smoking ban, but said the steps St. Charles is taking could be helpful. "

This is the second time that St. Charles Tower, Inc. has applied to place the tower on the vegetable seller's property, which is adjacent to residential neighborhood and a childcare center. 

The application did not receive enough votes from the board to win approval last time. 

City staff members wrote in a report that the request is reasonable because it's in a commercial location that fronts a major roadway and the tower would be screened by a fence and landscape buffer. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission disagreed with one aspect of the staff's report and amended it to read that the proposed tower cannot function in that location without a negative impact on the area. 

The Commission then voted on July 25 to unanimously recommend the Board of Aldermen deny the request for a permit. 

The Board of Aldermen is expected to consider the application at the Sept. 12 meeting. The meeting is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.

Phase one of the extension project will bring the trail from Mexico Road up through the St. Peters Golf Course to the club house.

In the long term, the plan is to extend the trail from the club house, under Interstate 70 to Old Town St. Peters. From there, a spur connection would link the trail to the Salt River Road. The extension is being funded by Great Rivers Greenway.

Great Rivers Greenway will present design plans for the new portion of the trail at a public meeting set from 4-6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 10 at the St. Peters Golf Course. 

The one-mile addition to the trail is expected to follow the perimeter of the golf course on the west side, said Jeff Hutsler. The trail is designed to keep the interaction between the trail users and golf carts at a minimum, he said. 

Some tee boxes will be moved and elevated and portions of the golf cart path moved closer to the pins.

""Some of the improvements that we're doing because of the trail going through there will actually enhance the game,"" Hutsler said. 

Great Rivers Greenway will consider comments made by the public Tuesday and make design recommendations to the Board of Aldermen, who would have to approve plans. From there, the engineering for the project is expected to be done in 2014 and the trail build out done in 2015.

The ban would apply to all parts of the county, but municipalities could enact more stringent laws. Currently O'Fallon and Lake Saint Louis have smoking bans. 
Cronin has tried several times to get a smoking ban passed. The most recent effort, which would have put two propositions before voters last November, was thrown out by a judge for procedural reasons. An ordinance passed by the County Council in 2011 was vetoed by County Executive Steve Ehlmann. 
This bill was crafted as a compromise, Cronin said, and doesn't even make the proponents of a smoking ban happy because it doesn't go far enough. He said his goal is to protect children from secondhand smoke. 
""I want to make the county a healthier place while preserving business rights,"" he said. 
Councilman Mike Elam questioned where the County would draw the line after enacting this ban. He wondered whether the county would eventually try to ban things like alcohol or Happy Meals. 
""I think it comes down to you know whether or not they smoke in there, i think if you don't want to eat at a place or drink at a place that has smoking, you turn around and walk out,"" he said. 
Councilman Joe Brazil also opposes the proposal. 
Councilman Terry Hollander, who supported Cronin's previous bills, said he believes the smoking ban should go before voters because it contains restrictions. 
""It's one of the things we've pretty much insinuated for the past two years that if anything did come from us, it would be with the idea that the people have the opportunity to weigh in and vote,"" he said. 
Councilman John White also supports putting the matter before voters. He said businesses have thrived in places where smoking bans have been put into place. 
""I think the problem is people are afraid of change and think their liberties are going to be taken away from them,"" he said. ""When it's done statewide, it doesn't hurt anybody."" "

The St. Peters Board of Alderman failed to approve the application for a special use permit at the July 25 meeting, with three voting in favor, three opposed and two absent. 

The company is coming back to the city just days after a new state law took effect which limits the ability of local municipalities to regulate locations of cell towers. 

Gov. Jay Nixon signed HB 331 into law in July. The legislation was opposed by the Missouri Municipal League and supported by AT&T. 

St. Charles Tower Attorney Eric Martin asked the Planning and Zoning Commission to again consider the application to place the tower at Anthony's Produce. 

He said that St. Charles Tower had already had two lengthy public hearings on the issue to find ways to meet concerns of the public, including moving the tower further away from a childcare center. 

""We wish to present this to the Board of Aldermen gain with all members present,"" he said. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission on Sept. 4 voted to recommend the Board of Alderman vote down the special use permit. Planning and Zoning Commissioner Keith McNames suggested that the tower would have a negative impact on the surrounding area. 

Shirley Michael, 81, spoke out again against the proposal during the public hearing Wednesday and against the new state law. Michaels said no one wants to live that close to a 90-foot cell tower. Her property backs Anthony's Produce. 

""We won July the 25, 2013 at the Alderman meeting. We felt good that we had our chance, that we were listened to. We had got our word out about what's happening behind closed doors. It doesn't pass the smell test. We have to stand up for our rights,"" she said.  

Before the commissioners voted, McNames suggested St. Charles Tower consider placing the tower in the parking lot across Jungermann Road from Anthony's Produce. He also suggested a few different places on the Anthony's Produce property. 

""I know St. Charles Tower wants to be a good neighbor to the community and a good neighbor to the residents, if you've got a quarter mile, a half mile, you ought to take a look at it.""

Martin asked the commission to consider the current application. He said the company would be willing to locate the tower wherever the city wanted on the property.  "
39,/missouri/stpeters/police-target-code-violations-across-city,2013-08-29T16:20:42Z,Police Target Code Violations Across City,0,0,Kalen Ponche,Patch Staff,"Residents with an inoperable car parked in the driveway, or who left their business vehicle parked in the street likely received a warning letter from the city of St. Peters recently.

The police department earlier this summer completed a city-wide sweep looking for violations of vehicle codes. Residents who had a violation were mailed a warning letter Aug. 12 and asked to come into compliance.

St. Peters Police Officer Melissa Doss said the department conducts these proactive sweeps periodically; the last one was four or five years ago.

Officers drive every street of every neighborhood and when they see violations, fill out a form. The ordinance officer then checks back to see if the problems have been corrected; if they haven't he sends another warning letter, Doss said.

Residents have ample opportunity to correct the violation, she added.
Still, at least one resident has questioned the tactic and the need to ticket vehicles that are in good condition sitting in driveways, but are not licensed.

Patch reader Aaron Heger posted a concern about the ordinance on the Patch boards. He wrote that his truck had been cited because he hadn't had time to fix the problem that prevented it from passing a safety inspection.
""I'm astounded that we, as a society, can nit pick at things like this, with all the other problems we face.

So, the city wants me to junk my truck because I can't fix it right away, which will cause me to incur a much higher expense later down the road, when I have to buy another truck. 

Am I completely out of line by thinking I should be allowed a little more discretion over the private property that I own?"" Heger wrote.
Doss said often people don't think about what would happen if every resident had a derelict vehicle.

""People would be up in arms,"" she said. ""If every single person had an RV in their yard, our property values would drop dramatically. The people who are complaining are the ones who want to be the only ones who would have a derelict vehicle.""

Normally, the Police Department has one officer assigned to ordinance enforcement full time, Doss said. She said he typically has less than 100 vehicle ordinance violations in a year.

If residents spot violations, concerns can be reported to the Citizen Action Center at (636) 477-6600. Callers will receive a response of some kind withing 72 hours and can track the progress on the complaint.

Having a partner not only means creating a family unit, it means sharing things like a home and other property. Understanding how your future retirement might affect your spouse is important. When you're planning for your retirement, here are a few things to remember:
Your spouse's benefit amount could be up to 50 percent of your spouse's full retirement age amount, if you are full retirement age when you take it. If you qualify for a benefit from your own work history and a spouse's record, we always pay your own benefit first. You cannot receive spouse's benefits unless your spouse is receiving his or her retirement benefits (except for divorced spouses). If you took your reduced retirement first while waiting for your spouse to reach retirement age, when you add spouse's benefits later, your own retirement portion remains reduced, which causes the total retirement and spouses benefit together to total less than 50 percent of the worker's amount. You can find out more about this at www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html.
On the other hand, if your spouse's retirement benefit is higher than your retirement benefit, and he or she chooses to take reduced benefits and dies first, your survivor benefit will be reduced, but may be higher than what your spouse received."

Both programs help safeguard millions of Americans as well as improve the quality of life for their family and friends. While Social Security offers retirement, disability, and survivors benefits, Medicare provides health insurance.
Medicare is our country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older and younger people receiving Social Security disability benefits. The program helps with the cost of health care, but it doesn't cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care.
When you first enroll in Medicare and during certain times of the year, you can choose how you get your Medicare coverage. There are 2 main ways to get Medicare:
Original Medicare
Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). If you want drug coverage, you can join a separate Part D plan. To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medicare (like your deductible and 20% coinsurance), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage. Examples include coverage from a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy, or from a former employer or union.
Medicare Advantage (also known as Part C)

Medicare Advantage is an ""all in one"" alternative to Original Medicare. These ""bundled"" plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. Part C plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. They also may offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover â€” like vision, hearing, dental, and more.
If you can't afford to pay your Medicare premiums and other medical costs, you may be able to get help from your state. States offer programs for people eligible for or entitled to Medicare who have low income. Some programs may pay for Medicare premiums and some pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance. To qualify, you must have limited income and resources."

During the course of the 2016 legislative session the Missouri General Assembly tackled several important issues designed to improve the state's criminal justice system. These are issues that received a great deal of discussion and debate, and were thoroughly vetted throughout the legislative process. Whether it is taking steps to shut down human traffickers in the state, or giving Missourians with minor offenses a second chance, the legislature made some positive steps forward this year that will make a substantive difference in the lives of many Missourians. Listed below are brief descriptions of several of the bills that are now law, or soon will be.
This year the legislature took action to enact legislation to combat sex trafficking and protect the victims of these crimes. While it's hard for some to believe that a form of slavery exists in modern times, human trafficking is all too real and a problem that has grown into a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. Each year, thousands of men, women, and children in the United States are exploited and forced into prostitution.

House Bill 1562 helps to fight sex traffickers by expanding the crime to include the act of advertising the availability of a minor or non-consenting adult for prostitution or pornography.
Currently, Missouri law does not comprehensively address advertising the availability of another person for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The goal of the bill is to shut down the internet sites that are used to help traffickers find buyers.

House Bill 1562 also includes two provisions to strengthen the protections provided through the Safe at Home Program. The program provides victims of sexual and domestic violence with a substitute address so that their actual physical address can remain confidential and inaccessible to their abusers. House Bill 1562 enhances the penalties for attempting to access the address of a participant in the Safe at Home Program. It also adds victims of human trafficking to the list of eligible participants.

In addition, House Bill 1562 limits the disclosure of related photographs and records to individuals who are part of an investigation or judicial proceeding. The goal with this change is to protect the confidentiality of children who are the victims of sexual offenses

The provisions of the bill become law on August 28."

Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per weekâ€”or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data setâ€”Iowaâ€”and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

The outer road would switch to westbound between Shady Springs Road and Mid Rivers Mall Drive and eastbound between Mid Rivers Mall Drive to where Mexico Road meets Veterans Memorial Parkway. 

Plans for the access changes to I-70 will be presented for public comment from 4 to 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at St. Peters City Hall. 

Russ Batzel, manager of the transportation and development services group for St. Peters, said the new plans incorporate changes suggested by businesses and the public at the last hearing, held a year ago.

""A year ago, what we heard was close to 90 percent of the people recognize there was a problem with congestion at 70 and at the interchanges at Mid Rivers and Cave Springs. A similar percentage felt the project was beneficial or somewhat beneficial to the traveling public,"" Batzel said. 

The challenge was to find a way to provide access to the various types of businesses that are located in the three-mile stretch along the corridor. Those businesses include big box stores like Costco, Mid Rivers Mall and hhgregg, car dealerships and smaller businesses. 

""The businesses were a little more skeptical,"" Batzel said. ""We've done things to address that by reconfiguring ramps and access."" 

The city added access from the outer road on both north and south to 70 and to 370. Previous plans did not have access to 370.

In the updated plan, drivers heading westbound on the north outer road would be able to get onto 370 and drivers coming off of 370 could get straight onto the outer road heading west. 

There are on-ramps to I-70 from northbound outer road planned at just past Executive Center Parkway, at 370 and at Mid Rivers Mall Drive.

Heading east on Veterans Memorial Parkway from Mid Rivers Mall Drive, drivers will be able to access 370 and also get on to I-70 at Executive Center Parkway and both right before and right after Cave Springs. 

The public is invited to give comments on the new plans, which would be incorporated into an access justification report for review by the Missouri Department of Transportation. The city hopes to receive approval and look to start construction at the end of 2014 into 2015. 

""We're generally trying to find a way to plan this for the betterment of hte community and access to the community, and again trying to consider every viewpoint,"" Batzel said. 

The estimated cost for the project has risen to between $12 and $15 million, Batzel said. Funding would come from a range of sources. "

The St. Peters Board of Aldermen approved St. Charles Tower's application for a special use permit for the tower on a 6-2 vote with Aldermen Tommy Roberts, Ward 3, and Judy Bateman, Ward 2, voting no. 

Alderman Jerry Hollingsworth, Ward 2, was the only Alderman to speak on the issue.

He said he was disappointed that locally-elected State Representatives supported a law that limits the ability of municipalities to impose certain regulations or requirements on the tower. 

House Bill 331 prohibits municipalities from imposing requirements or obligations about the appearance of facilities that are unreasonable, or rejecting a application based on perceived environmental effects of radio frequency emissions. 

The law took effect Aug. 28. 

""I will have to vote yes,"" he said. ""The courts are backing them up.""

St. Charles City Council President Dave Beckering plans to introduce a bill that would mandate the signage at the council meeting Sept. 24. He said all ten council members have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. 

Beckering said signs ensure everyone knows whether smoking is available before they go in. 

""I think it's reasonable from the perspective that this way, let's say you are a parent or grandparent of a young child, you know before you walk in the door whether it's smoking or not,"" he said. 

Signs would have to be posted at every entrance to the business that say either smoking is permitted or smoking is prohibited. The sign must have letters no smaller than 1 inch in height and would have to be posted by Jan. 1, 2014. 

Violating the law would result in a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment up to 3 months. 

Beckering proposed the bill after the city council dropped plans to consider a city-wide smoking ban earlier this year. 

The city held three town hall meetings on the issue and only received feedback from 102 people, 55 of which were opposed to any sort of smoking ban. Forty-four people were in favor of a ban. 

""We couldn't tell what they wanted to do,"" he said. ""There's certainly no consensus.""

St. Charles County Councilman Mike Klinghammer, a former member of the St. Charles City Council, is watching to see how the sign ordinance is received.

This is the second time that St. Charles Tower, Inc. has applied to place the tower on the vegetable seller's property, which is adjacent to residential neighborhood and a childcare center. 

The application did not receive enough votes from the board to win approval last time. 

City staff members wrote in a report that the request is reasonable because it's in a commercial location that fronts a major roadway and the tower would be screened by a fence and landscape buffer. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission disagreed with one aspect of the staff's report and amended it to read that the proposed tower cannot function in that location without a negative impact on the area. 

The Commission then voted on July 25 to unanimously recommend the Board of Aldermen deny the request for a permit. 

The Board of Aldermen is expected to consider the application at the Sept. 12 meeting. The meeting is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.

Currently, the Dardenne Greenway Trail runs through Rabbit Run Park, up to Mexico Road.

Phase one of the extension project will bring the trail from Mexico Road up through the St. Peters Golf Course to the club house.

In the long term, the plan is to extend the trail from the club house, under Interstate 70 to Old Town St. Peters. From there, a spur connection would link the trail to the Salt River Road. The extension is being funded by Great Rivers Greenway.

Great Rivers Greenway will present design plans for the new portion of the trail at a public meeting set from 4-6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 10 at the St. Peters Golf Course. 

The one-mile addition to the trail is expected to follow the perimeter of the golf course on the west side, said Jeff Hutsler. The trail is designed to keep the interaction between the trail users and golf carts at a minimum, he said. 

Some tee boxes will be moved and elevated and portions of the golf cart path moved closer to the pins.

""Some of the improvements that we're doing because of the trail going through there will actually enhance the game,"" Hutsler said. 

Great Rivers Greenway will consider comments made by the public Tuesday and make design recommendations to the Board of Aldermen, who would have to approve plans. From there, the engineering for the project is expected to be done in 2014 and the trail build out done in 2015.

County Councilman Joe Cronin, R-St. Paul, introduced a bill Monday that would ban smoking in public and enclosed places except for those that are only open to people and employees age 21 and older. The gambling areas of Ameristar Casino would be exempted under the ban along with most bars in St. Charles County. 
The ban would apply to all parts of the county, but municipalities could enact more stringent laws. Currently O'Fallon and Lake Saint Louis have smoking bans. 
Cronin has tried several times to get a smoking ban passed. The most recent effort, which would have put two propositions before voters last November, was thrown out by a judge for procedural reasons. An ordinance passed by the County Council in 2011 was vetoed by County Executive Steve Ehlmann. 
This bill was crafted as a compromise, Cronin said, and doesn't even make the proponents of a smoking ban happy because it doesn't go far enough. He said his goal is to protect children from secondhand smoke. 
""I want to make the county a healthier place while preserving business rights,"" he said. 
Councilman Mike Elam questioned where the County would draw the line after enacting this ban. He wondered whether the county would eventually try to ban things like alcohol or Happy Meals. 
""I think it comes down to you know whether or not they smoke in there, i think if you don't want to eat at a place or drink at a place that has smoking, you turn around and walk out,"" he said. 
Councilman Joe Brazil also opposes the proposal. 
Councilman Terry Hollander, who supported Cronin's previous bills, said he believes the smoking ban should go before voters because it contains restrictions. 
""It's one of the things we've pretty much insinuated for the past two years that if anything did come from us, it would be with the idea that the people have the opportunity to weigh in and vote,"" he said. 
Councilman John White also supports putting the matter before voters. He said businesses have thrived in places where smoking bans have been put into place. 
""I think the problem is people are afraid of change and think their liberties are going to be taken away from them,"" he said. ""When it's done statewide, it doesn't hurt anybody."" "

The St. Peters Board of Alderman failed to approve the application for a special use permit at the July 25 meeting, with three voting in favor, three opposed and two absent. 

The company is coming back to the city just days after a new state law took effect which limits the ability of local municipalities to regulate locations of cell towers. 

Gov. Jay Nixon signed HB 331 into law in July. The legislation was opposed by the Missouri Municipal League and supported by AT&T. 

St. Charles Tower Attorney Eric Martin asked the Planning and Zoning Commission to again consider the application to place the tower at Anthony's Produce. 

He said that St. Charles Tower had already had two lengthy public hearings on the issue to find ways to meet concerns of the public, including moving the tower further away from a childcare center. 

""We wish to present this to the Board of Aldermen gain with all members present,"" he said. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission on Sept. 4 voted to recommend the Board of Alderman vote down the special use permit. Planning and Zoning Commissioner Keith McNames suggested that the tower would have a negative impact on the surrounding area. 

Shirley Michael, 81, spoke out again against the proposal during the public hearing Wednesday and against the new state law. Michaels said no one wants to live that close to a 90-foot cell tower. Her property backs Anthony's Produce. 

""We won July the 25, 2013 at the Alderman meeting. We felt good that we had our chance, that we were listened to. We had got our word out about what's happening behind closed doors. It doesn't pass the smell test. We have to stand up for our rights,"" she said.  

Before the commissioners voted, McNames suggested St. Charles Tower consider placing the tower in the parking lot across Jungermann Road from Anthony's Produce. He also suggested a few different places on the Anthony's Produce property. 

""I know St. Charles Tower wants to be a good neighbor to the community and a good neighbor to the residents, if you've got a quarter mile, a half mile, you ought to take a look at it.""

Martin asked the commission to consider the current application. He said the company would be willing to locate the tower wherever the city wanted on the property.  "
59,/missouri/stpeters/police-target-code-violations-across-city,2013-08-29T16:20:42Z,Police Target Code Violations Across City,0,0,Kalen Ponche,Patch Staff,"Residents with an inoperable car parked in the driveway, or who left their business vehicle parked in the street likely received a warning letter from the city of St. Peters recently.

The police department earlier this summer completed a city-wide sweep looking for violations of vehicle codes. Residents who had a violation were mailed a warning letter Aug. 12 and asked to come into compliance.

St. Peters Police Officer Melissa Doss said the department conducts these proactive sweeps periodically; the last one was four or five years ago.

Officers drive every street of every neighborhood and when they see violations, fill out a form. The ordinance officer then checks back to see if the problems have been corrected; if they haven't he sends another warning letter, Doss said.

Residents have ample opportunity to correct the violation, she added.
Still, at least one resident has questioned the tactic and the need to ticket vehicles that are in good condition sitting in driveways, but are not licensed.

Patch reader Aaron Heger posted a concern about the ordinance on the Patch boards. He wrote that his truck had been cited because he hadn't had time to fix the problem that prevented it from passing a safety inspection.
""I'm astounded that we, as a society, can nit pick at things like this, with all the other problems we face.

So, the city wants me to junk my truck because I can't fix it right away, which will cause me to incur a much higher expense later down the road, when I have to buy another truck. 

Am I completely out of line by thinking I should be allowed a little more discretion over the private property that I own?"" Heger wrote.
Doss said often people don't think about what would happen if every resident had a derelict vehicle.

""People would be up in arms,"" she said. ""If every single person had an RV in their yard, our property values would drop dramatically. The people who are complaining are the ones who want to be the only ones who would have a derelict vehicle.""

Normally, the Police Department has one officer assigned to ordinance enforcement full time, Doss said. She said he typically has less than 100 vehicle ordinance violations in a year.

If residents spot violations, concerns can be reported to the Citizen Action Center at (636) 477-6600. Callers will receive a response of some kind withing 72 hours and can track the progress on the complaint.

Having a partner not only means creating a family unit, it means sharing things like a home and other property. Understanding how your future retirement might affect your spouse is important. When you're planning for your retirement, here are a few things to remember:
Your spouse's benefit amount could be up to 50 percent of your spouse's full retirement age amount, if you are full retirement age when you take it. If you qualify for a benefit from your own work history and a spouse's record, we always pay your own benefit first. You cannot receive spouse's benefits unless your spouse is receiving his or her retirement benefits (except for divorced spouses). If you took your reduced retirement first while waiting for your spouse to reach retirement age, when you add spouse's benefits later, your own retirement portion remains reduced, which causes the total retirement and spouses benefit together to total less than 50 percent of the worker's amount. You can find out more about this at www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html.
On the other hand, if your spouse's retirement benefit is higher than your retirement benefit, and he or she chooses to take reduced benefits and dies first, your survivor benefit will be reduced, but may be higher than what your spouse received."

Both programs help safeguard millions of Americans as well as improve the quality of life for their family and friends. While Social Security offers retirement, disability, and survivors benefits, Medicare provides health insurance.
Medicare is our country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older and younger people receiving Social Security disability benefits. The program helps with the cost of health care, but it doesn't cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care.
When you first enroll in Medicare and during certain times of the year, you can choose how you get your Medicare coverage. There are 2 main ways to get Medicare:
Original Medicare
Original Medicare includes Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance). If you want drug coverage, you can join a separate Part D plan. To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medicare (like your deductible and 20% coinsurance), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage. Examples include coverage from a Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy, or from a former employer or union.
Medicare Advantage (also known as Part C)

Medicare Advantage is an ""all in one"" alternative to Original Medicare. These ""bundled"" plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D. Part C plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medicare. They also may offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn't cover â€” like vision, hearing, dental, and more.
If you can't afford to pay your Medicare premiums and other medical costs, you may be able to get help from your state. States offer programs for people eligible for or entitled to Medicare who have low income. Some programs may pay for Medicare premiums and some pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance. To qualify, you must have limited income and resources."

During the course of the 2016 legislative session the Missouri General Assembly tackled several important issues designed to improve the state's criminal justice system. These are issues that received a great deal of discussion and debate, and were thoroughly vetted throughout the legislative process. Whether it is taking steps to shut down human traffickers in the state, or giving Missourians with minor offenses a second chance, the legislature made some positive steps forward this year that will make a substantive difference in the lives of many Missourians. Listed below are brief descriptions of several of the bills that are now law, or soon will be.
This year the legislature took action to enact legislation to combat sex trafficking and protect the victims of these crimes. While it's hard for some to believe that a form of slavery exists in modern times, human trafficking is all too real and a problem that has grown into a multi-billion dollar criminal industry. Each year, thousands of men, women, and children in the United States are exploited and forced into prostitution.

House Bill 1562 helps to fight sex traffickers by expanding the crime to include the act of advertising the availability of a minor or non-consenting adult for prostitution or pornography.
Currently, Missouri law does not comprehensively address advertising the availability of another person for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The goal of the bill is to shut down the internet sites that are used to help traffickers find buyers.

House Bill 1562 also includes two provisions to strengthen the protections provided through the Safe at Home Program. The program provides victims of sexual and domestic violence with a substitute address so that their actual physical address can remain confidential and inaccessible to their abusers. House Bill 1562 enhances the penalties for attempting to access the address of a participant in the Safe at Home Program. It also adds victims of human trafficking to the list of eligible participants.

In addition, House Bill 1562 limits the disclosure of related photographs and records to individuals who are part of an investigation or judicial proceeding. The goal with this change is to protect the confidentiality of children who are the victims of sexual offenses

The provisions of the bill become law on August 28."

Politics aside, Hillary Clinton was right: For most of human history, it usually took a village (or a tribe) of people to raise a child. Humans are social creatures: Though moms and -- to a lesser extent -- dads shouldered the major tasks of child-rearing, the support of the community played a huge role. Meals were cooked, kids were looked after, and social groups helped ensure the safe upbringing of the young.

Today, that same societal structure isn't anywhere near as prevalent. In its place are long waiting lists and sky-high costs associated with putting a child in day care.

How expensive has this gotten? If you lived in Washington, D.C., in 2011, putting your infant in a child care center would have cost $388 per weekâ€”or more than $20,000 for a full year. Of course, I'm cherry-picking one of the most expensive locales, but it highlights a nationwide trend. In fact, in every region of the country except for the West, a family with two children in child care spent more for their kids to be looked after than they did on all housing costs combined.

If you're expecting, or already have children, here are some key trends to keep in mind when deciding what to do when it comes to looking after your kids.

Location, Location, Location

This is the mantra of just about every real estate agent, but the same could be said of child care providers. For instance, full-time child care for an infant in Mississippi averaged $4,600 per year in 2011, but was $15,000 in Massachusetts.

But the difference in absolute dollars doesn't mean much when you consider that the average salary in Massachusetts is higher than what it is in Mississippi. Instead, the chart above shows the five least and most expensive states to have an infant in center-based care, as a percentage of median family income.

Even within states, however, there are big differences. And no variable seems to be more important than -- you guessed it -- location. But this time, instead of talking about different states, we're referring to the difference between living in an urban or suburban community (defined as near a city center of at least 50,000) and a rural one.

The most extreme example would be in Oregon, where the cost to put your infant in a child care center in an urban area is more than twice as expensive as it is in a rural area. But Oregon isn't alone (see the Urban Care vs. Rural Care chart above).

Is It a Better Option to Quit Your Job and Stay at Home?

When confronted with such costs -- and endless waiting lists -- many parents are faced with the difficult decision of whether to continue working or to take a few years off to care for their children themselves.

Of course, finances alone aren't the only consideration; for many people, their work is an intrinsically rewarding experience that goes beyond just earning a paycheck. But because one's approach to their work varies from individual to individual, let's just focus on the dollars and cents of such a decision.

One very important matter to be aware of is a federal tax credit available to families who have to pay for child care. The credit is good for up to 35 percent of your child care bill with a limit of $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children.

Let's take the most average state from our data setâ€”Iowaâ€”and see when it makes more financial sense to stay at home (See first chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above). The income for two working parents is $75,581, about double the income for one parent. As you can see in the chart, after taxes and the cost of childcare, it still makes far more financial sense to have both parents working.

But oftentimes, there's more than one child at home. In fact, let's assume there are three. And instead of assuming that both parents earn the same amount, let's assume the wife makes 77 percent of what the husband makes -- which reflects societal norms. How might that change the equation? (See last chart for ""Two Working Parents vs. One Working Parent"" above).

Even though it still makes financial sense to keep working, the numbers are much closer ($44,193 for two working parents vs. $39,167 for one working parent). Factor in the costs of buying formula and transportation, and you might easily find that staying home is just as good an option.

One thing to note here is that these are incredibly simple calculations, only taking into consideration personal exemptions and standard deductions for filing jointly. In the end, running your own numbers is the only way to know what financially works for you.

Once a day, Patch tackles national news that affects your community. If you have suggestions for tomorrow's story, email catherine.crawford@patch.com.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a 27-page report on Thursday detailing the expected costs of last month's two and a half week government shutdown. The report is based on information collected from independent forecasters.

The news isn't good. The OMB, an office of the President that aids in the management of the nation's budget, found that the congressional spat over health care and the debt ceiling will cost the United States at least $2 billion, and maybe as much as $6 billion.

Here are a few compelling reasons cited by the OMB:

1) Setback to jobs: In the first half of October, approximately 12,000 fewer private sector jobs were generated, first because of the threat of a shutdown, and then because of the shutdown itself.

2) Money for nothing: During the shutdown, federal workers were furloughed for a whopping combined total of 6.6 million days. After the dust settled, the government shelled out $2 billion to those furloughed federal employees for days that were never worked.

3) Impaired parks: Due to shutdown closures, the country's national parks forfeited about $500 million in visitor spending. Who knows how much the shutdown impacted private tourism companies in the United States.

The numbers above only speak to the economic bruise. The OMB report details further damage felt in areas such as public safety, international relations, federal research, and more.

Go here to read the entire report and see for yourself.

Do you think there will be a repeat of October's shutdown when Congress revisits the budget in January? Tell us in the comments or in a blog post."

The outer road would switch to westbound between Shady Springs Road and Mid Rivers Mall Drive and eastbound between Mid Rivers Mall Drive to where Mexico Road meets Veterans Memorial Parkway. 

Plans for the access changes to I-70 will be presented for public comment from 4 to 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at St. Peters City Hall. 

Russ Batzel, manager of the transportation and development services group for St. Peters, said the new plans incorporate changes suggested by businesses and the public at the last hearing, held a year ago.

""A year ago, what we heard was close to 90 percent of the people recognize there was a problem with congestion at 70 and at the interchanges at Mid Rivers and Cave Springs. A similar percentage felt the project was beneficial or somewhat beneficial to the traveling public,"" Batzel said. 

The challenge was to find a way to provide access to the various types of businesses that are located in the three-mile stretch along the corridor. Those businesses include big box stores like Costco, Mid Rivers Mall and hhgregg, car dealerships and smaller businesses. 

""The businesses were a little more skeptical,"" Batzel said. ""We've done things to address that by reconfiguring ramps and access."" 

The city added access from the outer road on both north and south to 70 and to 370. Previous plans did not have access to 370.

In the updated plan, drivers heading westbound on the north outer road would be able to get onto 370 and drivers coming off of 370 could get straight onto the outer road heading west. 

There are on-ramps to I-70 from northbound outer road planned at just past Executive Center Parkway, at 370 and at Mid Rivers Mall Drive.

Heading east on Veterans Memorial Parkway from Mid Rivers Mall Drive, drivers will be able to access 370 and also get on to I-70 at Executive Center Parkway and both right before and right after Cave Springs. 

The public is invited to give comments on the new plans, which would be incorporated into an access justification report for review by the Missouri Department of Transportation. The city hopes to receive approval and look to start construction at the end of 2014 into 2015. 

""We're generally trying to find a way to plan this for the betterment of hte community and access to the community, and again trying to consider every viewpoint,"" Batzel said. 

The estimated cost for the project has risen to between $12 and $15 million, Batzel said. Funding would come from a range of sources. "

The St. Peters Board of Aldermen approved St. Charles Tower's application for a special use permit for the tower on a 6-2 vote with Aldermen Tommy Roberts, Ward 3, and Judy Bateman, Ward 2, voting no. 

Alderman Jerry Hollingsworth, Ward 2, was the only Alderman to speak on the issue.

He said he was disappointed that locally-elected State Representatives supported a law that limits the ability of municipalities to impose certain regulations or requirements on the tower. 

House Bill 331 prohibits municipalities from imposing requirements or obligations about the appearance of facilities that are unreasonable, or rejecting a application based on perceived environmental effects of radio frequency emissions. 

The law took effect Aug. 28. 

""I will have to vote yes,"" he said. ""The courts are backing them up.""  

Several people who live near Anthony's Produce spoke out at the Board of Alderman meeting, raising concerns about property damage and questioning the need for the tower to be located in that spot. 

Eric Martin, attorney for St. Charles Tower, said tower will result in better cell phone coverage for people at a time when many people have dropped their landlines and demand has grown. "
74,/missouri/stpeters/st-charles-considers-smoking-or-nonsmoking-signs-for-businesses,2013-09-12T02:05:13Z,St. Charles Businesses May Have to Post Smoking...,0,0,Kalen Ponche,Patch Staff,"An effort is underway to require every business, public place and restaurant in St. Charles to post signs stating whether smoking is allowed in the establishment. 

St. Charles City Council President Dave Beckering plans to introduce a bill that would mandate the signage at the council meeting Sept. 24. He said all ten council members have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. 

Beckering said signs ensure everyone knows whether smoking is available before they go in. 

""I think it's reasonable from the perspective that this way, let's say you are a parent or grandparent of a young child, you know before you walk in the door whether it's smoking or not,"" he said. 

Signs would have to be posted at every entrance to the business that say either smoking is permitted or smoking is prohibited. The sign must have letters no smaller than 1 inch in height and would have to be posted by Jan. 1, 2014. 

Violating the law would result in a fine of up to $500 or imprisonment up to 3 months. 

Beckering proposed the bill after the city council dropped plans to consider a city-wide smoking ban earlier this year. 

The city held three town hall meetings on the issue and only received feedback from 102 people, 55 of which were opposed to any sort of smoking ban. Forty-four people were in favor of a ban. 

""We couldn't tell what they wanted to do,"" he said. ""There's certainly no consensus.""

St. Charles County Councilman Mike Klinghammer, a former member of the St. Charles City Council, is watching to see how the sign ordinance is received.

He spoke during a recent discussion of a proposed countywide smoking ban except in places that are limited to people ages 21 and older. Klinghammer is opposed to a smoking ban, but said the steps St. Charles is taking could be helpful. "

This is the second time that St. Charles Tower, Inc. has applied to place the tower on the vegetable seller's property, which is adjacent to residential neighborhood and a childcare center. 

The application did not receive enough votes from the board to win approval last time. 

City staff members wrote in a report that the request is reasonable because it's in a commercial location that fronts a major roadway and the tower would be screened by a fence and landscape buffer. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission disagreed with one aspect of the staff's report and amended it to read that the proposed tower cannot function in that location without a negative impact on the area. 

The Commission then voted on July 25 to unanimously recommend the Board of Aldermen deny the request for a permit. 

The Board of Aldermen is expected to consider the application at the Sept. 12 meeting. The meeting is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.

Currently, the Dardenne Greenway Trail runs through Rabbit Run Park, up to Mexico Road.

Phase one of the extension project will bring the trail from Mexico Road up through the St. Peters Golf Course to the club house.

In the long term, the plan is to extend the trail from the club house, under Interstate 70 to Old Town St. Peters. From there, a spur connection would link the trail to the Salt River Road. The extension is being funded by Great Rivers Greenway.

Great Rivers Greenway will present design plans for the new portion of the trail at a public meeting set from 4-6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 10 at the St. Peters Golf Course. 

The one-mile addition to the trail is expected to follow the perimeter of the golf course on the west side, said Jeff Hutsler. The trail is designed to keep the interaction between the trail users and golf carts at a minimum, he said. 

Some tee boxes will be moved and elevated and portions of the golf cart path moved closer to the pins.

""Some of the improvements that we're doing because of the trail going through there will actually enhance the game,"" Hutsler said. 

Great Rivers Greenway will consider comments made by the public Tuesday and make design recommendations to the Board of Aldermen, who would have to approve plans. From there, the engineering for the project is expected to be done in 2014 and the trail build out done in 2015.

County Councilman Joe Cronin, R-St. Paul, introduced a bill Monday that would ban smoking in public and enclosed places except for those that are only open to people and employees age 21 and older. The gambling areas of Ameristar Casino would be exempted under the ban along with most bars in St. Charles County. 
The ban would apply to all parts of the county, but municipalities could enact more stringent laws. Currently O'Fallon and Lake Saint Louis have smoking bans. 
Cronin has tried several times to get a smoking ban passed. The most recent effort, which would have put two propositions before voters last November, was thrown out by a judge for procedural reasons. An ordinance passed by the County Council in 2011 was vetoed by County Executive Steve Ehlmann. 
This bill was crafted as a compromise, Cronin said, and doesn't even make the proponents of a smoking ban happy because it doesn't go far enough. He said his goal is to protect children from secondhand smoke. 
""I want to make the county a healthier place while preserving business rights,"" he said. 
Councilman Mike Elam questioned where the County would draw the line after enacting this ban. He wondered whether the county would eventually try to ban things like alcohol or Happy Meals. 
""I think it comes down to you know whether or not they smoke in there, i think if you don't want to eat at a place or drink at a place that has smoking, you turn around and walk out,"" he said. 
Councilman Joe Brazil also opposes the proposal. 
Councilman Terry Hollander, who supported Cronin's previous bills, said he believes the smoking ban should go before voters because it contains restrictions. 
""It's one of the things we've pretty much insinuated for the past two years that if anything did come from us, it would be with the idea that the people have the opportunity to weigh in and vote,"" he said. 
Councilman John White also supports putting the matter before voters. He said businesses have thrived in places where smoking bans have been put into place. 
""I think the problem is people are afraid of change and think their liberties are going to be taken away from them,"" he said. ""When it's done statewide, it doesn't hurt anybody."" "

The St. Peters Board of Alderman failed to approve the application for a special use permit at the July 25 meeting, with three voting in favor, three opposed and two absent. 

The company is coming back to the city just days after a new state law took effect which limits the ability of local municipalities to regulate locations of cell towers. 

Gov. Jay Nixon signed HB 331 into law in July. The legislation was opposed by the Missouri Municipal League and supported by AT&T. 

St. Charles Tower Attorney Eric Martin asked the Planning and Zoning Commission to again consider the application to place the tower at Anthony's Produce. 

He said that St. Charles Tower had already had two lengthy public hearings on the issue to find ways to meet concerns of the public, including moving the tower further away from a childcare center. 

""We wish to present this to the Board of Aldermen gain with all members present,"" he said. 

The Planning and Zoning Commission on Sept. 4 voted to recommend the Board of Alderman vote down the special use permit. Planning and Zoning Commissioner Keith McNames suggested that the tower would have a negative impact on the surrounding area. 

Shirley Michael, 81, spoke out again against the proposal during the public hearing Wednesday and against the new state law. Michaels said no one wants to live that close to a 90-foot cell tower. Her property backs Anthony's Produce. 

""We won July the 25, 2013 at the Alderman meeting. We felt good that we had our chance, that we were listened to. We had got our word out about what's happening behind closed doors. It doesn't pass the smell test. We have to stand up for our rights,"" she said.  

Before the commissioners voted, McNames suggested St. Charles Tower consider placing the tower in the parking lot across Jungermann Road from Anthony's Produce. He also suggested a few different places on the Anthony's Produce property. 

""I know St. Charles Tower wants to be a good neighbor to the community and a good neighbor to the residents, if you've got a quarter mile, a half mile, you ought to take a look at it.""

Martin asked the commission to consider the current application. He said the company would be willing to locate the tower wherever the city wanted on the property.  "
79,/missouri/stpeters/police-target-code-violations-across-city,2013-08-29T16:20:42Z,Police Target Code Violations Across City,0,0,Kalen Ponche,Patch Staff,"Residents with an inoperable car parked in the driveway, or who left their business vehicle parked in the street likely received a warning letter from the city of St. Peters recently.

The police department earlier this summer completed a city-wide sweep looking for violations of vehicle codes. Residents who had a violation were mailed a warning letter Aug. 12 and asked to come into compliance.

St. Peters Police Officer Melissa Doss said the department conducts these proactive sweeps periodically; the last one was four or five years ago.

Officers drive every street of every neighborhood and when they see violations, fill out a form. The ordinance officer then checks back to see if the problems have been corrected; if they haven't he sends another warning letter, Doss said.

Residents have ample opportunity to correct the violation, she added.
Still, at least one resident has questioned the tactic and the need to ticket vehicles that are in good condition sitting in driveways, but are not licensed.

Patch reader Aaron Heger posted a concern about the ordinance on the Patch boards. He wrote that his truck had been cited because he hadn't had time to fix the problem that prevented it from passing a safety inspection.
""I'm astounded that we, as a society, can nit pick at things like this, with all the other problems we face.

So, the city wants me to junk my truck because I can't fix it right away, which will cause me to incur a much higher expense later down the road, when I have to buy another truck. 

Am I completely out of line by thinking I should be allowed a little more discretion over the private property that I own?"" Heger wrote.
Doss said often people don't think about what would happen if every resident had a derelict vehicle.

""People would be up in arms,"" she said. ""If every single person had an RV in their yard, our property values would drop dramatically. The people who are complaining are the ones who want to be the only ones who would have a derelict vehicle.""

Normally, the Police Department has one officer assigned to ordinance enforcement full time, Doss said. She said he typically has less than 100 vehicle ordinance violations in a year.

If residents spot violations, concerns can be reported to the Citizen Action Center at (636) 477-6600. Callers will receive a response of some kind withing 72 hours and can track the progress on the complaint.
