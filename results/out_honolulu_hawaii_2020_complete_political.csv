0,/hawaii/honolulu/americas-largest-cities-are-debt,2020-02-04T19:30:19Z,New report on the finances of America's cities,0,0,Truth in Accounting,News Partner,"Last week, Truth in Accounting released its fourth annual Financial State of the Cities report. The report found that only 12 of the 75 largest cities in the United States have a surplus. This means that the other 63 cities included in the report do not have enough money to pay their bills.
The cities are ranked based on their Taxpayer Surplus/Burden. Truth in Accounting divides the amount of money needed to pay bills by the number of city taxpayers to come up with the Taxpayer Burden. If a city has money available after all bills are considered, that surplus amount is likewise divided by the number of taxpayers to come up with the Taxpayer Surplus.
Altogether the 75 cities are $323.2 billion in debt. Furthermore, the cities have $176.2 billion in unfunded pension debt and $149.8 billion in unfunded other post-employment benefits (OPEB) debt.
Irvine, California can claim to have the best city finances in the U.S. with a $380 million surplus. If you were hypothetically to divide that figure by the number of Irvine taxpayers, each taxpayer's share is $4,100. The other 11 surplus cities include the District of Columbia, Charlotte, Fresno, Plano, Stockton, Lincoln, Aurora, Arlington, Tampa, Raleigh, and Tulsa.
On the other end of the spectrum, four cities received an F grade in the report. To receive an F grade in the report a city has to have a Taxpayer Burden in excess of $20,000. None of the cities in the report received an A grade.To receive an A grade a city would have to have a Taxpayer Burden over $10,000.
The four cities that received an F grade and their respective Taxpayer Burdens are as follows:
New York City has the worst Taxpayer Burden of the 75 cities in the report by a $26,000 margin, and ranked last in the report. This is not new for New York City as the last three Financial State of the Cities reports have found that the city has a Taxpayer Burden of over $60,000."

The report is based on the cities' 2018 comprehensive annual financial reports, which are not analyzed on this scale by any other organization.
The analysis by Truth in Accounting (TIA), a nonprofit government finance watchdog group, found Honolulu needs $3.3 billion to get out of the red, or $26,400.00 from each of its taxpayers.
According to the watchdog's annual Financial State of the Cities report, Honolulu has $6 billion in bills and only $2.7 billion in available assets to pay those bills after capital and restricted assets are excluded. This results in a $3.3 billion shortfall, or a $26,400.00 Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of the municipal debt after the city's available assets have been tapped.
TIA's Taxpayer Burden indicator incorporates both assets and liabilities, including all retirement liabilities. Fiscal year 2018 was the first year city governments reported all retirement liabilities, but TIA has been including this information in their analysis for the last several years.
The bottom line is that Honolulu does not have enough money to pay its bills, which is why it received a ""F"" grade for its fiscal health.

Originally published on Wednesday, November 20
For some, climate change is a theoretical crisis looming in the distance. But for many coastal and island cities, the damage is here.
Last week, the Honolulu city council voted unanimously to file a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, Chevron, British Petroleum, Shell and other oil companies for their role in warming the planet. The city is following in the footsteps of more than a dozen others, including Baltimore, Boulder, Colorado; and Santa Cruz, California, along with some counties and states, in suing fossil fuel companies over climate change.
""We are already feeling the impacts of climate change and having to spend city money to adapt our infrastructure,"" says Honolulu's Chief Resilience Officer Josh Stanbro, citing as examples beach erosion and increased flooding. ""We want to make sure the costs are born by the industry that created them.""
Hundreds of other complaints have been filed by environmental groups, activists and even some fishermen. Depending on the outcome, the rising tide of litigation could represent an important new front in the fight to limit the harm from climate change, and force energy companies to foot the bill for measures to address it.
But against the staunch opposition of energy companies, it's not at all clear the tactic will succeed.
""These misguided lawsuits will do literally nothing to address climate change and are nothing more than an opportunity for politicians and activists to score political points and for trial lawyers to win big paydays if they succeed,"" says Spencer Walrath, research director at Energy In Depth, a project of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, in an email.
Other critics contend that climate policy should not be determined in the courts. ""These lawsuits are examples of what we call 'regulation through litigation,' "" according to an email from Tiger Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Association, a Washington-based group that seeks to limit lawsuits against for big companies, including energy producers. ""Our courts exist to resolve disputes, not to solve society's most significant and complex problems,"" he said.
But others contend that climate campaigners have little choice but to turn to the courts.
""Ideally, Congress would be taking aggressive action,"" says Michael Gerrard, a law professor and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, which tracks climate-related lawsuits on a database. ""But it's not. The frustration on the part of the environmental community about legislative inaction is sparking litigation.""
Along with targeting energy companies, some of the lawsuits seek to force government regulators to act. Perhaps the most prominent was the action filed by 12 states and several cities to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA balked, claiming it lacked authority to act. In 2007, the Supreme Court rejected the EPA's assertion, ruling 5-4 in favor of the states.
Although the Trump administration has chipped away at enforcement–for example, by weakening restrictions on methane, a potent climate-warming gas– the decision acted as a sort of bugle call for other cities and states to sue both the federal government and fossil fuel companies.
Still, a number of climate-related lawsuits have been dismissed on various grounds. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled, 8-0, that a group of six states couldn't sue five power companies because their greenhouse gas emissions were a matter for the EPA. A suit by the Native Village of Kivalina against ExxonMobil was later thrown out for similar reasons. And last year, the city of New York's lawsuit against ExxonMobil was tossed out by a judge who ruled that the problem of global warming demanded a political solution.
Separately, New York state sued ExxonMobil for securities fraud, claiming that the oil giant, having long known about climate change, defrauded investors by downplaying the risks to the company from climate regulation. A three-week trial ended earlier this month, and the judge is expected to reach a decision before the end of the year. ExxonMobil officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Other lawsuits filed against ExxonMobil and other companies allege that they engaged in a disinformation campaign aimed at deceiving the general public and swaying government officials. One frequently cited 1998 memo from the American Petroleum Institute, a leading trade group, read in part: ""Victory will be achieved when… average citizens 'understand' (recognize) uncertainties in climate science.""
Some advocates see the pattern as reminiscent of tobacco industry obfuscation about the risks of cigarette smoking, and cite lawsuits against tobacco companies as inspiration for suing oil companies.
Other plaintiffs have taken aim at state and federal governments over their alleged inaction. The furthest advanced of these suits is Juliana vs. United States. Filed in 2015 on behalf of 21 people, then-aged 8 to 19, the complaint argues that by failing to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA and other federal agencies are violating the Constitution's protection of life and liberty.
""Defendants have known of the unusually dangerous risks of harm to human life, liberty, and property that would be caused by continued fossil fuel burning,"" the complaint reads. ""Instead, Defendants have willfully ignored this impending harm.""
The case is currently awaiting a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on whether it can proceed to trial.""The conservative majority on the Supreme Court will probably quash the Juliana case eventually,"" says Robert Percival, director of the climate law program at the University of Maryland. ""But it's possible you'll see some victories in some of the state court suits.""
The Juliana suit was filed by attorneys working for the non-profit Our Children's Trust, which has filed similar lawsuits on behalf of youthful plaintiffs against all 50 state governments. Many have been thrown out, but actions in nine states are still pending, with a decision expected soon by the Supreme Court of Alaska on whether that case can proceed to trial.
Hundreds of climate suits have also been filed in 28 other countries, including 98 cases in Australia, according to Gerrard of the Sabin Center at Columbia. A suit in the Netherlands would force the Dutch government to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent below 1990 levels.
""Climate change is certainly an all-hands-on-deck issue,"" says Josh Stanbro of Honolulu. ""You need a mix of tools and policies.""
The city's lawsuit ""is not going to stop global warming from happening. It is only going to offset the cost being born by taxpayers. This is purely to adapt to the new climate reality we face as an island community.""

HONOLULU – Attorney General Clare E. Connors today urged the U.S. Senate to enact the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act to curb illegal robocalls and 'spoofing'.
(Spoofing is the process whereby the robocaller is able to mimic the first six digits of a receiver's own number to make it appear that the call is from a local source and thus someone the receiver knows).
According to a study mentioned in a February FCC report, nearly 48 billion robocalls were made in 2018, nearly half of all cell phone calls in the U.S. in 2019 will be spam, and 90 percent of those spam calls will be spoofed to appear as though they're originating from the receiver's local area code.
A coalition of attorneys general from 54 states and territories, led by North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald, and Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, sent a letter to the U. S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation supporting the TRACED Act. The legislation is sponsored by Senators John Thune and Ed Markey.
""Telemarketing calls and robocalls are a daily source of frustration for Hawaii residents,"" said Attorney General Connors. ""The bipartisan TRACED Act prioritizes call authentication protocols in an effort to reduce these unwanted calls. It also authorizes creation of a working group focused on further limiting the impacts of these intrusions. We support this legislation and all such efforts to protect Hawaii consumers.""
In their letter, the attorneys general state that the TRACED Act enables states, federal regulators, and telecom providers to take steps to combat these illegal calls. The legislation will require voice service providers to participate in a call authentication framework to help block unwanted calls and creates an interagency working group to take additional actions to reduce robocalls and hold telemarketers and robocallers accountable.
More than 48 billion robocalls were made in 2018, making them the number one source of consumer complaints to the FTC and the FCC and resulting in millions in consumer losses. The state attorneys general work to enforce do-not-call laws and protect consumers in their states from being harassed and scammed by robocalls.

5,/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-worker-blasted-false-nuke-alert-thinking-it-was-real-fcc,2018-01-30T18:17:44Z,Worker Sent False Nuke Alert Thinking It Was Real,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"HONOLULU, HI — On Jan. 13, a state emergency management worker in Hawaii thought a missile threat drill was real and broadcasted an alert to cellphones, TV and radio stations, leading to statewide panic that the state was under nuclear attack. That's according to the Federal Communications Commission, which obtained the worker's written statement that state officials provided.
While some officials used social media to correct that an attack wasn't imminent, it took 38 minutes for officials to send a second alert retracting the warning, because Hawaii did not have a standardized system for sending such corrections, the FCC said.
At the time, the state was testing alert capabilities. The worker for the state Emergency Management Agency fired off an alert without authorization from a supervisor amid widespread fears over the threat of nuclear-tipped missiles from North Korea.
The federal agency, which regulates the nation's airwaves and sets standards for such emergency alerts, criticized the state's delay in correcting it.
""There were no procedures in place to prevent a single person from mistakenly sending a missile alert"" in Hawaii, said James Wiley, a cybersecurity and communications reliability staffer at the FCC. There was no requirement to double-check with a colleague or get a supervisor's approval, he said.
In addition, software at Hawaii's emergency agency used the same prompts for both test and actual alerts, and it generally used prepared text that made it easy for a staffer to click through the alerting process without focusing enough on the text of the warning that would be sent.
The worker, whose name has not been released, has refused to talk to the FCC. The employee still works at the state Emergency Management Agency but has been reassigned to a job without access to the warning system.
The FCC said the state Emergency Management Agency has already taken steps to try to avoid a repeat of the false alert, requiring more supervision of drills and alert and test-alert transmissions. It has created a correction template for false alerts and has stopped ballistic missile defense drills until its own investigation is done.
Officials previously painted the event as an accident. Gov. David Ige faulted a state worker who ""pressed the wrong button.""
The FCC did not come to the same conclusion.
The employee in question heard a recorded message that began by saying ""exercise, exercise, exercise"" — the script for a drill, the FCC said. Then the recording used language that is typically used for a real threat, not a drill: ""this is not a drill."" The recording ended by saying ""exercise, exercise, exercise.""
The worker did not hear the ""exercise, exercise, exercise"" part of the message and believed the threat was real, according to the employee's statement. He responded by sending an alert.

6,/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-gov-didnt-know-twitter-login-correct-missile-alert,2018-01-23T18:29:58Z,Hawaii Gov. Late To Correct Missile Alert,0,0,Feroze Dhanoa,Patch Staff,"An emergency alert that a ballistic missile was headed towards Hawaii flashed across iPhone screens earlier this month, sending residents running for cover and making phone calls to their loved ones. It was over 40 minutes later that residents were informed the alert was actually a false alarm and there was no missile headed towards the state.
Apparently one of the contributing factors to the delayed correction was the fact that Hawaii Gov. David Ige did not have the login information for his Twitter account. The ballistic missile alert went out at 8:07 a.m. and the correction from Ige's official governor's account came 17 minutes later at 8:24 a.m. even though Ige knew it was a false alarm two minutes after the alert went out.
At a press conference Monday, Ige was asked about the delay in response and here's what he had to say, per The Honolulu Star Advertiser:
""I was in the process of making calls to the leadership team both in Hawaii Emergency Management as well as others,"" Ige said. ""I have to confess that I don't know my Twitter account log-ons and the passwords, so certainly that's one of the changes that I've made. I've been putting that on my phone so that we can access the social media directly.""
Maj. Gen. Arthur ""Joe"" Logan, the Hawaii National Guard's top commander, told state lawmakers at a hearing that he called at 8:09 a.m. to inform him of the false alert. Cindy McMillan, Ige's spokeswoman, told The Associated Press the governor had to track her down to prepare a message for the public as Ige's communications team handles his social media.
Brig. Gen. Kenneth Hara, Logan's deputy, told lawmakers the state is exploring changing the emergency management agency's computer software so workers won't have to select alerts from a drop-down menu. Last weekend's mistake occurred when the employee selected an actual missile alert from the drop-down menu instead of a missile alert drill message. One possibility would be to use icons with color codes for the different alert options, Hara said.

7,/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-false-missile-alert-what-38-minutes-panic-looks,2018-01-14T22:30:36Z,Hawaii False Missile: 38 Minutes Of Panic,0,0,Daniel Hampton,Patch Staff,"HONOLULU, HI— Matt Nelson was making eggs for breakfast when, halfway through, two of his phones buzzed: ""BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.""
He didn't know what to do. He had never been faced with such a dire situation. What did he have time for? How long did he have left? He turned the stove off, threw on a pair of shoes and a hooded sweatshirt, texted his parents and headed for the elevator (the fire escape door wouldn't open).
Nelson was one of many people across the island chain to receive the alerts Saturday morning. Hours after the ordeal was over, he tweeted out what he called a stream of consciousness on a Google document with his recollection of what happened. Much of his story is quoted below with some minor editing for clarity.
Getting off the elevator downstairs, Nelson saw people gathered at the front of the building. Some got the alert, others didn't. They headed to a parking garage and quickly evaluated their options of where to seek shelter. Go into the stairwell? Stay in the parking garage?
""I don't know which is better,"" he wrote later. He racked is brain, trying to remember what the county civil defense agency had said about what to do in the event of an incoming nuclear missile.
""But I got s---,"" he wrote.
He followed others into the garage stairwell and noticed they're calling their loved ones. Nelson calls his mom and gives her his address. All the while, he listens for that fateful blast that would end life as he knows it.
""Someone says it's real. I don't check social media because I think I only have a few minutes left, maybe. Want to stay on the phone with my folks until the last second.""
Suddenly, he noticed everyone disappeared. Nelson, confused, briefly ventures outside.
""I'm scared. I think f---, it's going to go off and I'm in the worst possible spot,"" he wrote.
He sprinted back to the parking garage and a couple people saw him freaking out. Finally, someone tells him: It was a false alarm. Nelson nearly breaks down.
He then headed back up to his apartment and turned the stove back on to finish what he started: the eggs.
""They are the best godd---ed eggs I've ever had,"" he writes.
You can't blame Hawaiians for panicking. The dire warning that buzzed their phones and radios came just months after reports that North Korea may have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the state. For 38 minutes, many waited in horror and fear until, mercifully, a second alert came: someone messed up and hit the wrong button that sent the first alert. There was no missile.
""Today is a day that most of us will never forget,"" Hawaii Gov. David Ige said when the ordeal ended. ""A day when many in our community thought that our worst nightmare might actually be happening. A day when many frantically tried to think about the things that they would do if a ballistic missile launch would happen.""
Now, many people want to know why it took so long for civil defense to correct the alert and why they decided to tweet it before sending out a mobile push alert. Many people who got the alert had taken shelter and knew nothing about the correction until later. They didn't have computers; they had their phones.
The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency confirmed there was no ballistic missile threat and said no one hacked the agency's system. It was, in fact,""human error,"" the state Department of Defense said in a release.
The agency has taken steps to make sure that the mishap never happens again, officials said, and has started reviewing procedures to avoid a repeat of the mistake and how to correct it more quickly should one go out.
""We understand that false alarms such as this can erode public confidence in our emergency notification systems,"" the agency said in a release.
""I know first-hand how today's false alarm affected all of us here in Hawaii, and I am sorry for the pain and confusion it caused. I, too, am extremely upset about this and am doing everything I can do to immediately improve our emergency management systems, procedures and staffing,"" said Gov. Ige.
The following is a timeline of what happened during those moments of panic:
8:05 a.m. – A routine internal test is initiated during a shift change, involving the emergency alert system and the wireless emergency alert system. It did not include warning sirens.
8:07 a.m. – A warning test is triggered statewide, which Nelson and others receive.
8:10 a.m. – State Adjutant Maj. Gen. Joe Logan confirms with U.S. Pacific Command that a missile has not been launched. Honolulu police are alerted.
8:13 a.m. – State emergency officials shut down the test so warnings don't go out to phones that might not have received it the first time, including phones that were turned off, out of range or in airplane mode.
8:20 a.m. – State emergency officials alert the public of the cancellation via Facebook and Twitter.
8:24 a.m. – Gov. Ige retweets that cancellation notice.
8:30 a.m. – Ige posts the cancellation alert to his Facebook page.
8:45 a.m. –Thirty-eight minutes after the initial warning test is triggered, state emergency officials send out an alert via text, TV and radio to those who initially got the alert: it was a false alarm.
Emergency officials have suspended all future drills until a full investigation is completed. Officials have instituted a two-person activation rule for tests and real missile launch alerts. Furthermore, an automatic cancellation command — which can be triggered within seconds of an error — has been installed.
Emergency officials are also looking at expanding alert processes for the state's congressional delegations, county mayors, and vital staff.
A preliminary report of findings and corrective actions is expected to be issued this week.
Politico reported, citing a senior administration official, that President DonaldTrump's cabinet has not tested formal plans for how to respond to a missile attack. The news outlet said that Gen. John Kelly had planned to conduct the exercise when he served as secretary of Homeland Security, but left the position to become White House chief of staff before it was conducted. Acting Secretary Elaine Duke never carried it out, the outlet said.

8,/hawaii/honolulu/trump-travel-ban-may-be-partially-enforced-court-says,2017-11-13T22:59:33Z,Trump Travel Ban May Be Partially Enforced,0,0,Cody Fenwick,Patch Staff,"HONOLULU, HI — A U.S. appeals court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump's newest version of the travel ban to partially take effect.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling will bar people from six Muslim-majority countries included in the travel ban who do not have a ""bona fide"" relationship with a person or entity in the U.S. from entering the country. The ban can't be enforced against people who have those relationships.
Hawaii sued to stop the latest ban, which was announced in September. Hours before it was set to take full effect last month, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii issued a ruling blocking the ban. Watson found that the new ban, like the version before it, failed to show that nationality alone makes a person a greater security risk to the U.S.
The policy applied to travelers from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen plus some Venezuelan government officials and their families.
Rulings against the ban in Hawaii and later in Maryland apply only to the six Muslim-majority countries. They did not affect the restrictions against North Korea or Venezuela, because the plaintiffs did not ask for that. The Maryland ruling was narrower than the Hawaii one in that it allowed enforcement against those with no U.S. ties.
The U.S. government appealed, saying the rulings thwarted Trump's efforts to keep the American people safe.
The 9th Circuit in San Francisco had blocked previous versions of the ban.
""We are reviewing the court's order and the government will begin enforcing the travel proclamation consistent with the partial stay,"" U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said in a statement. ""We believe that the proclamation should be allowed to take effect in its entirety.""
The appellate judges adopted language that the Supreme Court itself either wrote or blessed when it considered legal challenges to the previous version of the travel ban.
In June, the justices said the travel ban could not keep out of the country people who could claim a bona fide relationship with someone or a group in the U.S.
The justices did not list precisely what kinds of relationships were covered, but they left in place a subsequent 9th circuit ruling that protected grandparents, cousins and other relatives.
Monday's ruling spells out the ""close family relationship"" includes grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.
The decision ""closely tracks guidance previously issued by the Supreme Court,"" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said in a statement. ""I'm pleased that family ties to the U. S., including grandparents, will be respected. We continue to prepare for substantive arguments before the Ninth Circuit on December 6 in Seattle.""

That may fly on the mainland, and even in the majority of Hawaiian cities. But in Honolulu, texting or looking at a cellphone while crossing the street is now illegal.
The ""distracted walking law"" — or ""zombie law,"" as some people are calling it on Twitter — was approved by Honolulu City Council in July, and police began enforcing it Wednesday. The law responds to Honolulu's pedestrian fatality rate, which is one of the highest in the nation, particularly among senior citizens.
The law aims to snap distracted walkers back to attention with some hefty fines — a fairly modest fine of up to $35 for a first offense, but up to $75 and $99 for second and third offenses, respectively, if they occur within the first year.
The law also makes it illegal to play video games, use laptop computers or digital cameras while walking. Like the distracted driving laws in place in several U.S. states, the law doesn't prescribe penalties for using cellphone headphones while walking.
Watch: Texting And Walking In Honolulu Could Now Cost You Up To $99
The National Safety Council says it's ""just as important to walk cell free as it is to drive cell free.""
""Pedestrians and drivers using cellphones are both impaired and too mentally distracted to fully focus on their surrounding,"" the organization said, according to a Honolulu city website post outlining the new distracted walking law. ""For pedestrians, this distraction can cause them to trip, cross roads unsafely or walk into motionless objects such as street signs, doors and walls.""
Between 2000 and 2011, more than 11,100 pedestrians were injured while using their cellphones, according to the National Safety Council, which tracks data on the leading causes of unintentional injuries and deaths.
Pedestrian fatalities spiked nine percent in 2016 from the year prior, according to a report by the Governor's Highway Safety Association, which said the increase corresponds with increased use of smartphones — ""a frequent source of mental and visual distraction"" for both drivers and pedestrians.
While there's data to support the law, that wasn't what prompted Honolulu Councilman Brandon Elefante to propose it. He told CNN he got the idea from high school students who ""were concerned for their peers being distracted while crossing the streets and looking at their phones instead of looking both ways.""
One of two council members who opposed the law when it was proposed last summer, Ernie Martin said the city should worry about bigger problems, including homelessness and a rail project with a $3 billion deficit. He thinks the law is overreaching and the problem of distracted walking could be better addressed through a public awareness campaign.
""Teenagers are most influenced by their peers,"" Martin told CNN in July. ""A social media campaign would probably be more expansive than any legislation we pass.""
Though Honolulu is the first major city to implement such a law, the police chief in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in 2012 ordered officers to ticket for ""dangerous walking,"" which could include everything from jaywalking to texting while walking. And several other U.S. jurisdictions are considering distracted walking laws, including San Mateo County, California and Stamford, Connecticut.
A New Jersey assemblywoman failed to get support last year for a proposed state law banning texting while walking.
Jonathan Matus, the CEO of Zendrive, which uses smartphone sensors to track driving, told Bloomberg that distracted walking laws may be misdirected.
""Sure, people can walk into a risky situation, but that implies that pedestrians are often at fault,"" he said. ""I feel like legislating pedestrian distraction might give aggressive drivers a scapegoat to blame fatalities on the road with, and I'm not excited about that aspect.""

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson on Tuesday granted Hawaii's request to temporarily block the federal government from enforcing the policy. It was supposed to take effect at midnight EDT Wednesday.
The Trump administration's most recent restrictions, which affect citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen — and some Venezuelan government officials and their families.

Hawaii argues the updated ban is a continuation of President Donald Trump's ""promise to exclude Muslims from the United States.""
In a statement, the White House called the decision ""dangerously flawed.""
""These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our Nation,"" it said. ""We are therefore confident that the Judiciary will ultimately uphold the President's lawful and necessary action and swiftly restore its vital protections for the safety of the American people.""
Other courts are weighing challenges to the policy. In Maryland, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups are seeking to block the visa and entry restrictions in the president's latest proclamation.

The lawsuit was filed in New York. The plaintiffs include New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said DACA will end in six months to give Congress time to find a legislative solution for the immigrants. (For more information on Trump's plan to end DACA and other Honolulu stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.

Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin tweeted:
The participants were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families who overstayed visas.
Those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they are eligible to renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn't accepting new applications.
Opponents of the program said they are pleased with the Trump administration's decision. They called DACA an unconstitutional abuse of executive power but proponents of the program said the move by Trump was cruel.
Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said the action violates the due process rights of the immigrants. He said he fears the information the immigrants provided the government to participate in DACA could be used against them.
""It's outrageous, it's not right,"" an emotional Ferguson said at a news conference in Seattle. ""As attorney general for the state of Washington, I have a hammer, it's the law.""
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee joined Ferguson at the news conference and said ""this is one more of a long train of abuses that this president has attempted to foist on this great nation.""
Earlier this year, Ferguson sued Trump over his travel ban, which resulted in a federal judge blocking nationwide enforcement.

12,/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-governors-race-personality-not-policy-define-election,2017-09-06T02:45:32Z,Personality To Define Hawaii Governor Race,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"HONOLULU, HI — It used to be said that in Hawaii incumbents were a lock for re-election. But in the 2014 primary election, now-Gov. David Ige unseated a fellow Democrat. Now U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is attempting to do the same to him.
Her announcement last week that she will file papers to establish a campaign committee sets the stage for infighting in the party. (For more information on the Democratic primary race and other Hawaii stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
If she runs, the race will be defined by personality differences instead of ideological ones, some political observers said Tuesday.
Ige, an engineer who served as a state senator in the Legislature for 28 years, ran against former Gov. Neil Abercrombie as a more even-keeled candidate.
Abercrombie's defeat made him the first Hawaii governor to lose to a primary challenger and only the second not to win re-election.
""We used to think in Hawaii that incumbents won,"" said Colin Moore, director of the public policy institute at the University of Hawaii.
Ige's more reserved style is now up against Hanabusa's stronger personality, said political analyst Dan Boylan.
""He doesn't give a good speech,"" Boylan said. ""He doesn't grandstand. ... He's a modest man. He is not a dumb guy. He is, however, boring.""
But being boring also means he hasn't committed any major mistakes, Boylan said, even though some criticize him for failing to take a strong stand on the divisive issue of a giant telescope planned for a mountain some Native Hawaiians consider sacred.
There's a perception that Ige isn't effective despite a robust state economy, Moore said.
""Hanabusa enters, who has more name recognition, has been away from state government,"" he said. ""She can run as the change candidate, which is a powerful thing to be able to do. I think there is a sense that (Ige) has not led the state.""
Hanabusa, a lawyer, served in the state Senate for 12 years, including four as president. She is in her fifth year in Congress.
Honolulu resident Haunani Dutro believes Hanabusa's ""feisty"" persona is more effective in Washington, D.C. ""I think personally I like where she's at right now,"" the retired hospice-care worker said.
Dutro said she likes Ige's record on Native Hawaiian issues and his subdued style.
""That's what we need,"" she said, ""someone who is humble and patient.""
Ige's approach hasn't improved Hawaii's homelessness crisis and lack of affordable housing, said Big Island resident Jerry Jucha. ""He was not as strong as some of the other governors,"" he said.
Moore said when former U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye was alive, no Democrat would have dared to challenge a sitting governor from the same party.
""There would have been a time where Sen. Inouye or others would have said 'you don't challenge Democrats and you need to wait your turn,'"" Moore said. ""But those days are over. There is no kingmaker anymore.""

13,/hawaii/honolulu/universal-basic-income-hawaii-forefront-exploration,2017-09-05T15:31:14Z,Hawaii Exploring Universal Basic Income,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"HONOLULU, HI — Hawaii is mulling over the contentious idea of providing a universal basic income as the country prepares to reap the benefits — and consequences — of a new era of driverless trucks, factory robots, delivery drones and virtual personal assistants.
Tech innovations are increasingly edging into the workplace and many fear robots are destined to take jobs that human beings have held for decades. For many affected workers, retraining might be out of reach —unavailable, unaffordable or inadequate.
What then?
Enter the idea of a universal basic income, the notion that everyone should be able to receive a stream of income to live on, regardless of their employment or economic status. It isn't an idea that seems likely to gain traction nationally in the current political environment. But in some politically liberal corners of the country, including Hawaii and the San Francisco Bay area, the idea of distributing a guaranteed income has begun to gain support. (For more information on universal basic income and other Hawaii stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
Over the past two decades, automation has reduced the need for workers, especially in such blue-collar sectors as manufacturing, warehousing and mining. Many of the jobs that remain demand higher education or advanced technological skills. It helps explain why just 55 percent of Americans with no more than a high school diploma are employed, down from 60 percent just before the Great Recession.
Hawaii state lawmakers have voted to explore the idea of a universal basic income in light of research suggesting that a majority of waiter, cook and building cleaning jobs — vital to Hawaii's tourism-dependent economy — will eventually be replaced by machines. A crucial question — who exactly would pay for the program? — has yet to be determined. But support for the idea has taken root.
""Our economy is changing far more rapidly than anybody's expected,"" said state Rep. Chris Lee, who introduced legislation to consider a guaranteed universal income.
Lee said he felt it's important ""to be sure that everybody will benefit from the technological revolution that we're seeing to make sure no one's left behind.""
Here are some questions and answers:
___
WHAT IS A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME?
In a state or nation with universal basic income, every adult would receive a uniform fixed amount that would be deemed enough to meet basic needs. The idea gained some currency in the 1960s and 1970s, with proponents ranging from Martin Luther King Jr. to President Richard Nixon, who proposed a ""negative income tax"" similar to basic income. It failed to pass Congress.
Recently, some technology leaders have been breathing new life — and money — into the idea. Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and others have promoted the idea as a way to address the potential loss of many transportation, manufacturing, retail and customer service jobs to automation and artificial intelligence.
Even some economists who welcome technological change to make workplaces more efficient note that the pace of innovation in coming years is likely to accelerate. Community colleges and retraining centers could find it difficult to keep up. Supporters of a universal basic income say the money would cushion the economic pain for the affected workers.
___
WHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM?
In the long run, that would likely be decided by political leaders. For now, philanthropic organizations founded by technology entrepreneurs have begun putting money into pilot programs to provide basic income. The Economic Security Project, co-led by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and others, committed $10 million over two years to basic income projects.
A trial program in Kenya, led by the U.S. group GiveDirectly, is funded mainly funded by Google; the Omidyar Network started by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar; and GoodVentures, co-led by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.
Providing a basic income in expensive countries like the United States would, of course, be far costlier.
Tom Yamachika, president of the Tax Foundation of Hawaii, a nonprofit dedicated to limited taxes and fairness, has estimated that if all Hawaii residents were given $10,000 annually, it would cost about $10 billion a year, which he says Hawaii can't afford given its $20 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.
""Basic income is such a broad subject, it could encompass hundreds of different kinds of mechanisms to help families,"" Lee said. ""You don't have to enact the entire thing in one massive program. You can take bits and pieces that make sense.""
Karl Widerquist, co-founder of the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network, an informal group that promotes the idea of a basic income, suggests that Hawaii could collect a property tax from hotels, businesses and residents that could be redistributed to residents.
""If people in Alaska deserve an oil dividend, why don't the people of Hawaii deserve a beach dividend?"" he asked.
Other proponents suggest replacing part of the nation's web of social support programs with a universal basic income.
Some, like Natalie Foster, co-chairwoman of the Economic Security Project, say they think that if universal income took off in the U.S., it would begin incrementally — perhaps by taxing carbon emissions and distributing the money as basic income, an idea explored in California and Washington D.C.
A study by the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank, found that distributing a universal income by increasing the federal debt would expand the economy because of the stimulating effects of the additional cash.
___
WHERE DOES UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME EXIST NOW?
Not on a large scale in the United States. But the idea is being pursued in small trials overseas. The program that New York-based GiveDirectly has established in Kenya is distributing $22 a month to residents of a village for the next 12 years — roughly what residents need to buy essentials.
The group says one goal is to assess whether people will change their behavior if they know they will enjoy a guaranteed income for an extended time. GiveDirectly is distributing money to 100 people and plans to expand to 26,000 recipients once the group reaches its $30 million funding goal, said Paul Niehaus, a co-founder.
""We had someone say, 'I used to work this job in Nairobi as a security guard because it was the only way I could pay for my kids' education, but now that I have this basic income I can afford to move back and actually live with my family again,' "" he said.
In Oakland, California, Y Combinator, a startup incubator, is giving about $1,500 a month to a handful of people selected randomly and will soon expand distribution to 100 recipients. It eventually plans to provide $1,000 monthly to 1,000 people and study how recipients spend their time and how their financial health and well-being are affected.
Finland is distributing money to 2,000 randomly selected people. It hopes to learn how it might adapt its social security system to a changing workplace, incentivize people to work and simplify the bureaucracy of benefits.
In India, which is also considering distributing a universal basic income, the transportation minister has said the country would ban driverless cars because they would imperil people's jobs, according to The Times of India.
___
AND IN THE UNITED STATES?
Republican-leaning Alaska has long distributed revenue from oil extraction to its residents in payments ranging from about $1,000 to $2,000 annually.
A study commissioned by the Economic Security Project found that 72 percent of Alaskans saved the money for essentials, emergencies, debt payments, retirement or education. Just 1 percent said that receiving the oil dividend had made them likely to work less.
""People are very supportive of the dividend,"" Foster said. ""They don't see it as a handout; they see it as their right as an Alaskan to receive the income from the oil royalties.""
In Hawaii, a group of politicians, economists, social services providers, business and union representatives will meet in the fall to begin gathering data. They'll examine Hawaii's economy and its exposure to disruption and automation and how those trends could affect social safety nets, Lee said. After that, they'll explore whether it makes sense to offer full or partial universal income.
""It could very well mean that it would be significantly cheaper to look at other options rather than let our existing services be overwhelmed by a changing economy,"" Lee said.
___
WHAT DO CRITICS SAY?
Aside from the cost, some detractors say they fear that distributing free money could diminish some people's work ethic and productivity.
In Hawaii, with one of the nation's worst homelessness rates, some worry that basic income would attract unemployed people to move to the island.
""A lot of poor people move here anyway, because they don't freeze,"" Yamachika said. ""This won't help.""

14,/hawaii/honolulu/honolulu-train-project-gov-ige-expected-sign-funding-bill,2017-09-02T12:33:09Z,Honolulu Train Project: House Passes Funding Bill,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"HONOLULU, HI — Hawaii legislation to raise $2.4 billion in taxes to bail out Honolulu's troubled commuter train plan has been approved by the state Senate and House, and now heads to Gov. David Ige for review and a signature.
The proposal previously passed the Senate and Hawaii's House took a big step Friday in approving the funding plan, which is vital to the project's future. It was the last day of a special legislative session.
The $9.5 billion rail transit line, one of the most expensive per-capita in the nation, is less than half built and faces a shortfall up to $3 billion. (For more information on the Honolulu commuter rail project and other Honolulu stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
Rail officials are up against a Sept. 15 deadline from the Federal Transit Administration to show they can pay for the project. Without that assurance, they risk losing $1.5 billion in federal money and the possibility of having to return about $800 million in federal money already spent.
Critics have said the project is too costly and doesn't make sense on an island with high construction costs and a small population.
But ardent supporters say it will encourage affordable housing and transit-oriented development while providing relief to commuters on the west side, where drivers can sit in traffic for hours and there's only one route into urban Honolulu.
""This will dramatically improve the quality of life for the people of West Oahu,"" said Democratic Rep. Matt LoPresti, who represents parts of Ewa on the West side.
The bill would extend a surcharge on the general excise tax — a surcharge now planned through the end of 2027 — for another three years, generating $1 billion for the project. The general excise tax, currently about 4.5 percent on Oahu, is essentially a business income tax that's often passed on to customers.
The bill also would raise the hotel tax — also called the transient accommodation tax — statewide by 1 percentage point to 10.25 percent for 13 years, through 2030.
It also would increase the amount that counties receive from the tax from $93 million to $103 million.
""To come out here and then to go back to the neighbor islands and ask them to pay for rail is going to be very, very difficult,"" said Democratic Rep. James Tokioka, who represents Lihue and other parts of Kauai and voted against the proposal. ""People on the neighbor islands think Honolulu takes too much from the pot.""
His fellow representative from Kauai, Democratic Rep. Dee Morikawa, disagreed, saying Oahu residents help neighbor islands in many ways.
""When an island needs help, we step up,"" she said. ""That is our job. That is what we're elected to do.""
The proposal also calls for more oversight of the rail project. It would require the state to conduct an audit, and money would be directed into a new state fund so the state comptroller could review expenses before doling out the money.
Republican representatives introduced floor amendments to cap money going to rail, exclude neighbor islands from the hotel tax increase, require a forensic audit to look for irregularities — not just an audit — and require that 10 percent of rail funds come from public-private partnerships.
""People are saying enough is enough,"" said Republican Rep. Gene Ward, arguing for the funding cap.
All four amendments failed to pass.
Rep. Sylvia Luke said she understands the concerns of neighbor islanders, but an amendment limiting the hotel tax increase to Oahu and exempting neighbor islands would guarantee that not enough funds are provided for the rail line.

15,/hawaii/honolulu/oahu-train-project-lawmakers-address-budget-shortfall,2017-08-26T15:01:22Z,Oahu Train Project: Lawmakers To Tackle Funding,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"HONOLULU, HI — Hawaii lawmakers plan to convene a special session Monday to address a budget shortfall of up to $3 billion to finish a planned $9.5 billion rail transit project — one of the most expensive per capita in the United States.
Train tracks supported by concrete pillars currently snake through Oahu neighborhoods, but end abruptly in an empty, overgrown field. The commuter line has been in the works in and around Honolulu for more than a decade, but it's less than 50 percent complete.
State lawmakers failed to plug the funding gap earlier this year. Legislative leaders tentatively agreed to a bill, but whether it will pass is unclear. If no solution is found by Sept. 15, the federal government could demand that Honolulu return more than $800 million it has already spent and withhold the rest of a promised $1.5 billion funding package. (For more information on the train project and other Honolulu stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
Experts say U.S. rail projects often run over budget, but Hawaii's situation is among the worst they've seen.
""Right now it's probably a race between California and Hawaii of who's going to get their projects built or have the biggest boondoggle in the country,"" said Keith Millhouse, a transportation consultant and national expert on mass transit issues, referring to a $64 billion bullet train planned between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Both projects have faced funding issues and lawsuits.
But the Honolulu project stands out because of spiraling costs that have pushed its price tag to nearly $10,000 per person, thousands more than other U.S. rail lines. The proposed 20-mile route stretches from suburbs west of Honolulu into downtown and stops short of the tourist mecca Waikiki.
Transit experts around the country say the project makes no sense given Honolulu's size and the fact that materials must be shipped to the island state. They warn spending so much on rail could divert funding from other sources, including buses, which could limit schedules and lose riders.
""The capital cost is way too high, and the expected ridership is way too low,"" said Dan Chatman, associate professor of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's pretty simple.""
Yet the rail line has its ardent supporters, who say it's a matter of fairness to Oahu's sprawling west side.
That part of the island — with its fast-growing suburbs, affordable homes and a rural stretch that is home to many Native Hawaiians — has lower incomes than other parts of the island and has only one route in and out. Residents there deserve an alternative route to Honolulu to save them from crushing traffic that consistently rates among the nation's worst, the supporters say.
On the island's wealthier windward side, three highways connect residents to urban Honolulu.
""It's a social justice issue,"" said Howard Garval, president and CEO of the nonprofit Child and Family Service. ""You have to get the kids up at an ungodly hour just to get into town early enough, and they're sleeping in their car or having breakfast in their car before school opens, and that's sad to me.""
Critics counter the rail line would do little to help. By 2030, Oahu traffic is expected to increase 24 percent from 2007 conditions, an estimate that falls just 2 percentage points if the rail line is built.
""The reason people supported rail is because they could get some relief, and that's not the case,"" former Hawaii Gov. Ben Cayetano said.
Experts also question the ridership estimate of 119,600 trips per day. That's nearly twice the ridership per kilometer of Miami's heavy rail - a metropolitan area five times the size of Honolulu - and a little higher than that of Atlanta, which has a population six times the size of Honolulu, according to Erick Guerra, assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania.
The issue has upended Hawaii politics, impacting campaigns and diverting lawmakers' attention from pressing issues such as Honolulu's homeless crisis. Cayetano, who has pushed for bus rapid transit instead of rail for decades, placed an ad in the Washington Post in April asking the federal government to stop funding Hawaii's rail project.
City and rail officials say lawsuits delayed the project, driving up the price because rail officials couldn't execute new contracts in 2012, when construction costs started rising.
State lawmakers say their trust of city officials deteriorated when they didn't get adequate information from Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell - who was pushing for an extension of the general excise tax - about why costs climbed so rapidly. The general excise tax, currently about 4.5 percent on Oahu, is essentially a business income tax that's often passed on to customers.
""He owes it to the public to justify what specific things led to the cost overruns,"" House Finance Chairwoman Sylvia Luke said.
Cost estimates could increase further as the rail project heads into Honolulu's urban core, where utility lines must be relocated and where crews unearthed bone fragments indicating construction could disrupt Hawaiian burial grounds.
Caldwell declined to be interviewed through a spokesman who said the mayor heard from state lawmakers that they didn't appreciate his taking his concerns to the media. However, in a letter to lawmakers Thursday, Caldwell said the tax increases proposed in the measure to be taken up Monday are not enough to close the funding gap.
A bill to find a tax solution became a bargaining chip during the legislative session earlier this year, and was pushed to the final day - with representatives arguing the state should tax tourists, not residents, to fund rail - before it died. In the aftermath, a state senator lost her committee chairmanship, and former House Speaker Joe Souki was pressured to resign his leadership post.
Caldwell has noted thousands of Waikiki hotel workers commute into town every day, riding the bus or sitting in traffic for more than two hours each way, and said they deserve a better quality of life.
Others tout the development of affordable housing, restaurants and businesses already emerging around planned rail stations.
""This is not a money-making project,"" said Krishniah Murthy, the project's interim executive director. ""You are creating the future of this island, how the island grows in a very sustainable way and keeps the quality of life that everybody's looking for.""

16,/hawaii/honolulu/hawaii-helicopter-crash-5-soldiers-idd-search-ends,2017-08-22T13:27:35Z,Hawaii Helicopter Crash: 5 Soldiers Identified,0,0,Associated Press,News Partner,"HONOLULU, HI — A search was called off Monday for five soldiers who disappeared when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in the ocean last week off the coast of Hawaii.
The Army, Coast Guard, Navy and local Hawaiian agencies conducted a massive search, but strong currents pushed the wreckage into a deep-water search area spanning 72,000 nautical miles.
The Army identified the missing soldiers as 1st Lt. Kathryn M. Bailey, 26, of Hope Mills, North Carolina; Chief Warrant Officer 3 Brian M. Woeber, 41, of Decatur, Alabama; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Stephen T. Cantrell, 32, of Wichita Falls, Texas; Staff Sgt. Abigail R. Milam, 33, of Jenkins, Kentucky; and Sgt. Michael L. Nelson, 30, of Antioch, Tennessee. (For more information on the helicopter crash and other Oahu stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)
""Our five soldiers who represent the best and the brightest of America have not been found,"" said Maj. Gen. Christopher Cavoli, commander of the 25th Infantry Division.
The families of the missing soldiers were told Monday the search and rescue operation was ending, Cavoli said.
""It is a very, very difficult decision, and it weighs heavily, particularly on the hearts of the Coast Guard,"" said Rear Adm. Vincent B. Atkins, commander of the U.S. Coast Guard's 14th District.
""We used all of our training and professionalism in this very dynamic environment to mount the best response possible,"" Atkins added.
There has been no determination yet of the crash's cause, Cavoli said after the search was suspended.
Two Black Hawk helicopter crews were conducting training off the western tip of Oahu the night of Aug. 15 when one aircrew lost contact with the crew whose helicopter went missing.
When the pilot on the lead helicopter realized the other aircraft was missing, he immediately turned his helicopter around and began to search, Cavoli said. But he later determined he didn't have the equipment he needed to launch a professional search so he alerted the Coast Guard, Cavoli said.
A multi-agency team searched more than 72,000 nautical miles over the last week but saw no signs of life or of the crew that went missing. They found what appeared to be pieces of helicopter fuselage and a helmet in a debris field that expanded with strong currents to remote, deep areas of the ocean.
The Navy brought in remotely operated underwater vehicles and sonar to help in the search and get a better picture of the ocean floor, which drops quickly off the coast of Oahu and is over 1,000 feet deep in parts of the search area.
During the search, the Army and Coast Guard held joint briefings with family members every six hours to keep them informed, Cavoli said.
The fact that parts of the fuselage were found indicated the helicopter's impact with the ocean was substantial, said Mario Vittone, a retired Coast Guardsman and expert on sea survival.
""There's not a big record of people surviving impacts with the water when the impact is so significant that the fuselage is torn apart,"" he said.
People can last about three days without water as long as they are not working very hard, but in the ocean it is difficult to get rest while trying to survive, Vittone said.
All five crew members on board had life vests, air bottles for underwater breathing and radios with built-in GPS systems, the Army has said.
""All these things lead you to believe they didn't leave the aircraft, because if they could get out of the aircraft and inflate their floatation devices, then why would they not then turn on their beacons?"" Vittone said.

Medical pot dispensaries began opening in the state this summer, but they couldn't sell their products because the state hadn't certified any labs to conduct the required testing.
On Monday, state health officials changed that, approving Honolulu-based lab Steep Hill Hawaii. The lab is the first to begin testing samples of medical marijuana and brings Hawaii one step closer to the long-awaited date when dispensaries can sell their products.
""This is a big milestone, and it couldn't have come any sooner, because many people within the industry were getting frustrated and a little angry at the time it has taken to get to this point,"" said state Sen. Will Espero, a Democrat. ""But now that we are here, hopefully the next phase in terms of sales will happen quickly and everything will go smoothly.""
Once the lab receives samples, it will take about four days to test and return products to dispensaries for sale, said Dana Ciccone, owner of Steep Hill Hawaii. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)

Then the dispensary will undergo one final inspection by the Department of Health with the product present, department spokeswoman Janice Okubo said. That on-site inspection and accompanying paperwork could take 24 to 48 hours, she said.
Steep Hill worked tirelessly over the past year to receive certification so patients could finally access safe, legal cannabis, Ciccone said in an email. ""Today is a big step in the right direction for Hawaii's Medical Cannabis industry,"" he said.
The product at Honolulu-based dispensary Aloha Green has been ready for months, and dispensary CEO James H.Q. Lee said he hopes to begin the lab testing process Tuesday.
""We've been waiting, so that's very good news. I think the patients will be happy,"" Lee said.
But Lee still has questions about what size sample to prepare, and he hasn't gotten a definitive answer from the Department of Health, he said.
Maui Grown Therapies also is ready to begin testing its product, said Teri Freitas Gorman, director of community relations and patient affairs at the dispensary.
""We've been waiting for this day for quite some time, and now that it's here it's very exciting news for us,"" she said. ""Being on a neighbor island, there's a little bit of a logistical hurdle that we have to overcome, but we'll overcome it.""

September 28, 2020
HONOLULU- Today, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell notified the Federal Transit Administration of the City and County of Honolulu's decision to conclude its participation in the procurement of a Public-Private Partnership for the Honolulu Rail Project.
While the City has withdrawn its participation, it is up to the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART), as the administrative lead agency in this joint procurement, to cancel the procurement. Until it is canceled, the procurement remains active, which keeps the details of the proposals confidential.
""I remain committed to the rail project and encourage HART to explore a more open and effective approach of continuing the construction to Ala Moana,"" said Mayor Caldwell. ""I hope to see the timely development of an alternative bid strategy, such as a more traditional design-build approach, so this important transportation infrastructure project can continue to move forward.""

September 23, 2020
HONOLULU – Mayor Kirk Caldwell tonight announced that Governor David Ige has approved the City and County of Honolulu's Emergency Order No. 2020-27 ending the Second Stay at Home / Work from Home Order, as well as approving the first tier of Honolulu's COVID-19 Recovery Framework. The final executed documents are posted on Honolulu.gov.
Starting on Thursday, September 24, the City will operate under this new Recovery Framework. The City will start in Tier 1 and remain there for at least four weeks.
Tier 1 includes, but is not limited to, the following changes:
All essential and designated businesses and operations will still need to comply with Social Distancing Requirements as outlined in the Order. A signed version of Emergency Order No. 2020-27 which further outlines businesses and operations allowed to resume operations on September 24, along with guidance for those businesses and operations, will be posted at Honolulu.gov.
Honolulu's COVID-19 Recovery Framework sets the criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on businesses and activities on O'ahu while trying to aggressively reduce coronavirus transmission to protect residents and mitigate the current burden on our local healthcare system. The plan rests on four tiers. Each tier is based on the level of community spread of COVID-19, which is determined by: (1) the number of daily cases reported and (2) the positivity rate, using 7-day averages over a two week period.
The full document laying out the framework for business/operation sectors allowed to resume operations in each tier can be viewed on Honolulu.gov.
In order to advance to the next tier, the City must:
The City may only move forward one tier at a time.
If, for two consecutive Weekly Assessments, the data for the First Metric indicates the City should be in a lower tier, the City falls back into that tier. The City may move backward more than one tier at a time.
From the start of this pandemic, much has been learned from a scientific standpoint, which has informed and will continue to inform the City's response efforts. Moreover, experience has uncovered critical areas for improvement, including testing, contact tracing, outreach and support for disproportionately affected communities, and the capacity and ability to quickly isolate/quarantine. The City has worked aggressively on its own and jointly with the State Department of Health to significantly improve in these areas. For example, the City has acquired additional rooms for quarantine and isolation at the Harbor Arms Hotel in 'Aiea with another property coming on shortly for those that cannot safely isolate or quarantine at their residence. The City has secured a contract with a company for an additional 80 contact tracers with negotiations underway for similar contracts to hire up to 250 additional contact tracers (as needed), in coordination with the State Department of Health. The City is also continuing its efforts to expand testing capacity through its partnership announced in the Spring with the University of Hawai'i. Lab equipment has been installed and is now going through the verification process at the John A. Burns School of Medicine. Lab staff have been hired and are working full time on site. This new lab is expected to start processing COVID-19 tests by the first week of October, and will boost on-island test processing capacity by 25% as our island economy reopens.
If you have any questions on Honolulu's COVID-19 Recovery Framework or Emergency Order No. 2020-27, the City and County of Honolulu COVID-19 information call center remains open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except on holidays.

September 14, 2020
The Honolulu Planning Commission public hearing set for Sept. 16 on a request to relocate the PVT landfill in Leeward Oahu has been postponed after the applicant announced it intends to withdraw the application.
PVT Land Company had sought a state special use permit to relocate the landfill directly across its Lualualei Naval Road location. A public hearing was set for Wednesday and PVT had asked that the hearing be postponed until a later date. But a company representative at a hearing on the extension request on Monday announced it planned to withdraw the application.
The commission on Monday voted to postpone the hearing until Dec. 2, but expects PVT to submit its letter of withdrawal prior to that date.
The withdrawal comes a day before a bill passed by the Legislature that would put severe restrictions on landfills was to become law. The Legislature passed SB 2386 and Gov. David Ige has until Sept. 15 to sign the bill or allow it to become law without his signature.
PVT acknowledged on Monday that if it withdrew the application that it would not be able to reapply for a year.

23,/hawaii/honolulu/honolulu-city-releases-p3-bid-information,2020-12-17T07:32:01Z,Honolulu City Releases P3 Bid Information,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Press release from the City and County of Honolulu:
December 15, 2020
HONOLULU— Today the City and County of Honolulu released the amounts of the two bids received in the recent Public Private Partnership solicitation, which was cancelled on November 25, 2020. The proposal documents for the P3 procurement will soon be available for review, provided by HART, with some proprietary information redacted.
The P3 procurement began with the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) on September 28, 2018. Two proposals were received from Priority Listed Offerors (PLOs) on July 23, 2020. After much consideration, the P3 solicitation was cancelled on November 25, 2020.
Pricing
The PLOs were provided with ""affordability"" amounts for both the Design and Construction and the Operations and Maintenance components of the Project. Two affordability thresholds were provided: an Affordability Target and an Affordability Limit. The RFP stated that a PLO's proposal may be rejected if it exceeded any of the Affordability Limits.
A summary of the pricing proposals follows:
Design & Construction:
The Design and Construction (D&C) affordability limit started with a base capital budget of approximately $1.4 billion, excluding estimated financing costs. The affordability amounts provided to the PLOs were determined in 2018; however, subsequently, the affordability that can be certified by HART has decreased significantly, due in part to the impact from COVID-19 on future funding estimates.
The D&C affordability amounts and the price proposals were stated in the form of ""Annual Availability Payments"" and require that a factor of 15.65 be applied in order to determine the total actual cost.
Design and Construction Pricing (inclusive of financing costs) were:
PLO A
PLO B
Affordability Limit
Affordability Target
Annual Affordability Payments
$177.3 million
$174.4 million
$110.0 million
$100.0 million
Total
Cost
$2.775 billion
$2.730 billion
$1.722 billion
$1.565 billion
As illustrated above, both of the D&C price proposals received from the PLOs exceeded the Affordability Limit by more than $1 billion, or approximately 60%. Additionally, the two price proposals were within 2% of each other.
Operations and Maintenance:
The Operations and Maintenance (O&M) affordability amounts were based on independently-developed O&M cost estimates, which assumed a P3 scenario and, therefore, included estimated costs of the P3 developer. Estimated costs for a non-P3 scenario would differ from these amounts. The O&M affordability was stated as a Net Present Value (NPV) of the O&M costs over the proposed 30-year term of the O&M period.
Operation and Maintenance Pricing (stated as a NPV amount over 30 years):
PLO A
PLO B
Affordability Limit
Affordability Target
Total O&M
$2.878 billion
$2.257 billion
$2.600 billion
$2.340 billion
As shown above, one of the O&M price proposals exceeded the Affordability Limit by approximately $278 million, or approximately 11%, and the other proposal was below the Affordability Target by approximately $83 million, or approximately 4%. The lower bid is comparable to the City's O&M cost estimate for a non-P3 operating scenario.
Revenue Service Date
The Revenue Service Date (RSD) is essentially the completion date of the design and construction of the Project. The required RSD in the initial RFP was December 31, 2025. The RFP was later amended to change the required RSD to September 2026. Both proposals committed to a September 2026 RSD. However, the dates proposed by the PLOs were based on estimated completion dates for the City Center Utility Relocation project that were provided by HART several months before the proposals were due. Subsequently, these dates were extended by a range of 1 to 4 years, which will have a direct impact on the overall project schedule.
Priority Listed Offerors (PLOs)
As was recently reported in the media, the PLOs who submitted proposals for the P3 were:
City Center Connection Group (""C3G"" and ""PLO A""), which consisted of Dragados, ACS Infrastructure Development, John Hancock, Hawaiian Dredging Construction Company, Obayashi Design Group, Hatch Construction Management, Rizzani De Eccher USA, DTL, The Wilhelm Group, Soteria Co., IBI Group, Dan Brown and Associates, Systra International Bridge Technologies, WCIT Architecture, Walker Consultants, Minatoishi Architects, KSF Inc., Wilson Okamoto Corp., Apex Design, LKG-CMC Consultants, Inc. and Zephyr UAS, Inc.
Imua Transit Honolulu (""ITH"" and ""PLO B""), which consisted of Plenary, Tutor Perini Corporation, Parsons Construction Group, Granite Construction Company, Traylor Brothers Inc., First Transit Inc. and Sumitomo Corporation of Americas.
We appreciate the significant interest shown in the rail project by these organizations. We hope there is continued interest from each of them for further discussion and involvement in the project as alternative plans are developed.
Additional Information
Attached to this release is a redacted copy of the letter from the City's Chief Procurement officer to the Executive Director and CEO of HART, recommending cancellation of the P3, and explaining the information contained in this release in greater detail.

December 16, 2020
HONOLULU – The City and County of Honolulu yesterday successfully sold $273.67 million worth of Wastewater System Revenue Bonds, Senior Series 2020A (Taxable) at an interest rate of approximately 2.16 percent. Nearly $3 billion in bond orders were received from 81 mainland and Hawai'i institutions. The net proceeds from this bond sale will be used to refinance certain outstanding bonds which will save rate payers roughly $32.7 million in future interest payments.
Moody's and Fitch rated the city's senior wastewater revenue bonds ""Aa2/AA,"" with a stable outlook. The ratings reflect the wastewater enterprise's strong service area, diverse economy, and ongoing rate support. Bank of America Securities, the lead underwriter in this transaction, noted that investors were drawn to the high quality credit quality of the wastewater bonds.
The City's Department of Environmental Services uses bond proceeds to help pay for important work on wastewater pump stations, pipe infrastructure, treatment plants, and other facilities through the wastewater system, and includes areas such as Ala Moana, Chinatown, 'Ewa Beach, Iwilei/Kapālama, Kailua, Kāne'ohe, Nu'uanu, Sand Island, Honouliuli, and Wai'anae.

HALE'IWA – Work will be continuing this week as part of an initial effort to increase safety, provide better beach access, and improve traffic conditions along undeveloped land across from Laniakea Beach.
Last week, crews from the City and County of Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation cleared the brush land on the mauka-side of Kamehameha Highway to allow access for a contractor to install a fence delineating City-property from the adjacent pasture land.
The installation of the fence is scheduled to begin tomorrow, with approximately 1,200 linear feet of chain link fencing being installed near the edges of the undeveloped area and the City's property further mauka.
""The installation of the fence on the City's property is part of a larger, long term plan under the State Department of Transportation to improve traffic and pedestrian safety along this stretch of highway,"" said Mayor Kirk Caldwell. ""I am encouraged that the plan is moving forward as this is a very heavily trafficked area, and we need to make it safer and more welcoming for surfers and beach goers.""
During the construction of the fence, parking near the construction access point will be restricted. The fence installation is scheduled to be finished by the end of the month.
For many years various solutions have been discussed on how to make these improvements to the popular surfing spot and tourist destination.
Other interim solution measures may include:
Interim measures may be in place for at least one year, unless unsafe conditions arise in this area that require further action.

October 13, 2020
The Department of Planning and Permitting (DPP) Kapolei Hale permit center will remain closed to the public, except for limited service, until Oct. 20 after three employees there tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week.
With three workers testing positive and several in quarantine, the DPP is unable to provide adequate staffing at the Kapolei permit center. Customers may drop off permit applications and plans, but there will not be any person-to-person contact with DPP staff. Plan reviews also will be curtailed while the employees are out. Telephone calls are still being answered.
All other services, including payment of completed permits, are still available at the downtown permit center in the Fasi Municipal Building.
The Kapolei permit center has been closed since the afternoon of Oct. 2 following a power outage, and has remained closed to the public because of the staffing issue.

8 October 2020
HONOLULU — The City and County of Honolulu (City) Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency launched ""Climate Ready Oahu"" today, inviting community participation to help shape a first ever overall climate adaptation strategy for our island.
""As an elected leader and a father, I take climate change seriously and want to do everything I can to help to protect our residents from climate risks coming our way,"" said Mayor Kirk Caldwell. ""As we work on COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, we still need to keep an eye on the horizon and take the steps now to reduce risk, and help us thrive as a community for years to come.""
A community effort to adapt to climate change impacts is different and distinct from an effort to slow or stop climate change from occurring. A ""Climate Action Plan"" lays out the path to reducing carbon pollution from fossil fuels that are the cause of global heating. A ""climate adaptation strategy"" is much different: it lays out how communities have to change to protect themselves from larger storms and other impacts that are coming our way as a result of climate change already underway. The development of a specific Climate Ready O'ahu adaptation strategy was identified by the community as a key priority, and listed as Action #28 in the recent O'ahu Resilience Strategy. Climate Ready O'ahu will include:
""This Climate Ready O'ahu strategy is essentially a roadmap to living safely on this island, but it will only be as strong as the community knowledge that helps draw it,"" said Josh Stanbro, Chief Resilience Officer and Executive Director of the City's Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency. ""Just like COVID-19, climate change is an all-hands-on-deck moment—and one agency or one community can't do it alone. We are hoping to learn what the community wants to protect, and the best way to do it together as we face mounting storms, floods, and heatwaves.""
The historic fires on the west coast of the continental United States, unprecedented hurricane activity in the gulf coast, and a resurgence of drought conditions here in Hawai'i have all put climate change risk back on the radar for residents even as global populations continue to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Island-wide adaptation strategies are critical for protecting communities that are experiencing climate impacts now. While reducing our greenhouse gas emissions will lessen future consequences, our lack of collective action up to now means that we are locked into the negative impacts from our past emissions for the next few decades,"" said Dr. Victoria Keener, Chair of the City Climate Change Commission. ""Get involved! The many opportunities for public input and participation in shaping this plan will help ensure that the burdens and benefits of climate adaptation are more equitably shared.""
To learn more about the project timeline and to participate in a resident survey, please visit www.climatereadyoahu.org. Community-wide learning sessions will also be held by the City and all residents are welcome to attend on-online and engage. First and second round virtual engagements will be held:
*Engagements will be held online via Zoom. Each round offers three dates and times to accommodate participants' varying availabilities/preferences. Interested participants need only attend one meeting per each round.
The Climate Ready O'ahu website at www.climatereadyoahu.org features a ""Learn"" page that presents an interactive representation of climate science from the City Climate Change Commission's 2018 ""Climate Change Brief,"" which all are encouraged to explore, particularly students and teachers. Website visitors can also explore the O'ahu Heat Vulnerability Map Series, which reminds us that climate change impacts include more than just coastal hazards and flooding and drought, but also the current and increasing stresses of rising temperatures.
Lastly, the Resilience Office and the Honolulu Land Information System (HoLIS) Division of the Department of Planning and Permitting created the Climate Ready O'ahu Web Explorer bringing together multiple climate risk data into one map viewer to facilitate community learning and for use by residents, businesses, and City staff. This is also available at the project's ""Learn"" page or directly at bit.ly/climatereadyoahumap.
After incorporating community input in several phases and utilizing technical experts to identify key areas of risk, the Climate Ready O'ahu adaptation strategy is anticipated to be completed in September 2021.

October 8, 2020
HONOLULU – Mayor Kirk Caldwell and the City and County of Honolulu thank Oʻahu residents for their participation in the 2020 Census. Today's total response rate report on the 2020 Census website shows that 99.9% of Hawaiʻi households have been enumerated, one of the top states in the country. The city also wants to inform residents that if their household count has changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there's still time to update their numbers. The 2020 Census self-response deadline has been extended to Oct. 31. A person can visit my2020census.gov and sign-in using their address to make necessary adjustments to their count.
According to the report, 62.9% of residents self-reported their census and 37.2% of responses were enumerated through Nonresponse Followup (NRFU). NRFU responses come through official census takers visiting households that hadn't completed the 2020 Census on their own.
""A 99.9% completion means that almost every single household on Oʻahu and in our entire state responded to the 2020 Census. This means our islands were able to reach every community in an equitable way,"" said Mayor Caldwell. ""Every language barrier, economic barrier, and housing barrier were addressed by our local census leadership, committees and community groups. Thank you to every person who helped in this effort and all of our residents who completed the 2020 Census this year. Oʻahu and all Hawaiʻi residents will reap the benefits in terms of more robust federal support until the next census cycle 10 years from now.""
""The resilience of our community in completing this important project in the midst of a pandemic is an achievement that we can collectively take pride in,"" said Managing Director Roy Amemiya.
The city would like to thank the enumeration team for their hard work visiting households through the COVID-19 pandemic to bring our state into the top percentile of enumerated states. The city also thanks local complete count committees and the diverse group of community players involved at the statewide level. This includes groups focused on kūpuna, the Pacific Island community, the homeless community, and the many people who speak English as a second language. Every census response will bring the necessary funds to help us recover, rebuild, and strengthen our position for resiliency moving forward.
The City and County of Honolulu created a 2020 Complete Count Committee with the goal of ensuring every city employee and their family is counted in the 2020 Census, outreaching and facilitating inclusion of key populations (kūpuna, homeless individuals, and the non-English speaking population), and to maximize the use of the new online option in completing the census. Some of the city's efforts included producing a city-specific brochure for public distribution and a placard that was placed in city buses. Graphics can be downloaded at this link.
About the Census:
An accurate 2020 Census count ensures that our communities will be eligible to receive billions in federal program dollars to support our communities through hospital funding, fire department and other public safety needs, food assistance, and representation in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2016 alone, the Counting for Dollars 2020 study published by George Washington University reported that Hawaiʻi received $3.68 billion through 55 federally funded programs guided by data derived from the 2010 Census. This roughly equated to $2,500 per person counted at that time.
With over $675 billion in federal funding being distributed based on census results, a 1% error could cost Hawaiʻi at least $37 million a year for the next ten years. Thanks to census informed data, approximately $90 million in federal funds went towards roads and public transportation in rural areas in Hawaiʻi, and $45 million went to lunch programs in local schools each year from 2010 to 2020.
