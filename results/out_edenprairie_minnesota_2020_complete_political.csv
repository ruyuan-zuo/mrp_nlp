May 22, 2020
A temporary order is in effect allowing any Eden Prairie business located in a commercial or industrial zone to establish drive-up or drive-thru areas, customer ordering, waiting or pick-up areas, or customer seating or service areas on its property to facilitate safe commercial activity consistent with federal and state orders or guidelines. The temporary outdoor use can occur in parking areas or green space areas without a variance.
No City permits are required for establishing these customer service areas, but operators must prepare a traffic management plan, and provide on-site traffic and operational management. Customer waiting, seating or service areas must not impede sidewalk usage nor block disabled persons parking spaces or ramps, or create nuisance conditions for abutting properties.

That burden equates to $4,700 for every taxpayer.
What's most concerning about Minnesota's financial condition is that government officials have misled the public by failing to disclose significant amounts of retirement debt on the state's balance sheet, despite new rules to increase financial transparency. This skewed financial data gives Minnesota's residents and taxpayers a false impression of the state's overall financial health.
However, thanks to strong performance in the financial markets in the last couple of years, Minnesota's public pension liabilities have decreased, according to Truth in Accounting CEO Sheila Weinberg.
""Minnesota's taxpayers are on a roller-coaster ride because of major gains in the financial markets,"" Weinberg said. ""The state's pension plan actuaries estimate Minnesota will have to contribute significantly less to the funds, which is why the state's net pension liability decreased dramatically.""
Truth in Accounting is a Chicago-based nonprofit think tank that analyzes state and municipal financial reports when they are published. According to its report for 2017, Minnesota had $30.7 billion worth of bills and $21 billion in available assets after capital and restricted assets were excluded. This results in a $9.7 billion shortfall and a $4,700 Taxpayer Burden™, which is each taxpayer's share of state bills after its available assets have been tapped. TIA's Taxpayer Burden indicator incorporates both assets and liabilities, not just pension debt.
And because of an accounting rule implemented two years ago, Minnesota must report all of its pension debt on the balance sheet. At the end of the 2017 fiscal year, the state's reported pension debt was $40.5 billion. And while it reported all of its pension debt, Minnesota continues to hide most of its retiree health care debt, also known as other post-employment benefits. Its total hidden debt comes out to $314.2 million. A new accounting standard will be implemented next year that will require state and local governments to report this debt on the balance sheet.
The bottom line is that Minnesota would need $4,700 from each of its taxpayers to pay all of its bills, which is why it received an ""C"" grade for its fiscal health.

Susan Allen (DFL-62B) has introduced a bill that would prohibit licensed therapists from trying turn gay youth straight.
Reparative therapy or conversion therapy is a pseudoscientific treatment that aims to change sexual orientation. The country's major mental health and pediatric associations have all said homosexuality is not a mental disorder or something that needs to be cured. The American Psychological Association says conversion therapy has ""no support among any mainstream health and mental health professional organizations.""
Allen said conversion therapy practitioners aren't as overt as they once were but that the treatment is still widespread.
""If you look at over the period of the last five years, they've sort of changed the way they advertise their services,"" Allen told Capitol Report host Julie Bartkey. ""It's not as obvious anymore that some of the Christian, sort of, based mental health services that offer this type of therapy. It's just sort of given that it's part of their family therapy. So it is prevalent, and it is a nationwide problem.""
Minnesota's best known conversion therapy practitioner is Marcus Bachmann, the husband of 6th District Congresswoman Rep. Michele Bachmann. In 2011, Marcus Bachmann acknowledged that therapists in his Christian counseling business will offer conversion therapy to those who want it—although he said the practice, which was renamed Counseling Care in December, is not focused on converting gays to heterosexuality.
Said Allen: ""It's a practice that's been discredited. There's 40 years of research.""
If passed, Allen's law would apply only to licensed practitioners and the prohibition would only be in effect for minors. The state licensing boards would be responsible for monitoring and discipline.
""We don't dictate the terms of what the discipline should be, but we do deem it that it is prohibited and that it is something that needs to be regulated,"" Allen said.
Minnesota would not be the first state with such a ban. California passed a law banning so-called gay aversion therapy. Critics sued, alleging that the law violated free speech and parental rights. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that the law regulates ""professional conduct, not speech."""

The Eden Prairie legislator has introduced a bill that would remove a ban on Sunday liquor sales. If the bill passes, liquor stores would be able remain open Sundays, although local communities could set the hours and rules for liquor sales.
Loon, the deputy minority leader, released the following statement Monday announcing the bill:
""The time has come for state government to abolish this outdated law and move the decision closer to the people. While local governments should have the final say in how these sales are controlled, our citizens and businesses deserve a less restrictive regulatory climate that invites competition, creates jobs and brings fundamental freedom back to our communities. While I understand and appreciate some of the concerns raised by opponents of Sunday sales in the past, none of our neighboring states ban off-sale liquor sales on Sunday, and Minnesota is one of only 12 states nationwide with such a law. I have worked with both Republicans and Democrats who are ready to make this small but important change to our state statutes and enhance our economic competitiveness.""
Sunday liquor sales have been a long-running controversy in Minnesota. Some critics worry that Sunday sales would be hard on small businesses, while others say residents don't need another day to buy alcohol. But supporters argue that the state ban takes power away from business owners and local communities and causes Minnesota businesses to lose out to neighboring states.

Rep. Joe Atkins (DFL-District 52B)—whose district includes all or parts of Eagan, Inver Grove Heights and Mendota Heights—wants to require a ""kill switch"" on smart phones. The switch would allow people whose phones were stolen to go back to their home computer and disable the phone.
""You turn it into basically a paperweight—which means it no longer has any value, and that's what's prompting criminals to steal these devices,"" he told Capitol Report host Julie Bartkey.
Atkins cites Federal Communications Commission statistics saying that nearly one in three robberies across the country involve smart phones.
""Not only was it a monetary (thing)—it's like $30 billion now across the country—but they've become so violent,"" he said. ""It used to be that they'd snatch your phone and take off. Now they're hitting people over the head. They're beating them up. And then they're stealing their cell phone.""
Twin Cities residents got a visible example of this violence when thieves attacked former Hennepin County commissioner and Minneapolis mayoral candidate Mark Andrew.
Andrew was at a Mall of America Starbucks when someone stole his phone. When he chased down the thief, two female teenagers attacked him, one with a metal baton. He was able to hold onto them until police arrived, but he emerged from the robbery bloody.
There has been a string of robberies of electronic devices—such as smart phones, tablets and computers—elsewhere, including some incidents near the University of Minnesota. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has warned residents to be careful when using the devices in public spaces.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar has also called on manufacturers to build kill switches into their phones.
""Mobile devices aren't just telephones anymore – increasingly people's livelihoods depend on them,"" a Dec. 30 statement quoted Klobuchar. ""That's why we need to do more to crack down on criminals who are stealing and reselling these devices, costing consumers billions every year. The wireless industry needs to step up to the plate and address these thefts, and make sure consumers have the most advanced security technology at their fingertips."""

The Internal Revenue Service announced plans to open the 2014 filing season Jan. 31 and encouraged taxpayers to use e-file or Free File as the fastest way to receive refunds.
The new opening date for individuals to file their 2013 tax returns will allow the IRS adequate time to program and test its tax processing systems. The annual process for updating IRS systems saw significant delays in October following the 16-day federal government closure.
""Our teams have been working hard throughout the fall to prepare for the upcoming tax season,"" IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel said. ""The late January opening gives us enough time to get things right with our programming, testing and systems validation. It's a complex process, and our bottom-line goal is to provide a smooth filing and refund process for the nation's taxpayers.""
The government closure meant the IRS had to change the original opening date from Jan. 21 to Jan. 31, 2014. The 2014 date is one day later than the 2013 filing season opening, which started on Jan. 30, 2013 following January tax law changes made by Congress on Jan. 1 under the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA). The extensive set of ATRA tax changes affected many 2012 tax returns, which led to the late January opening.
The IRS noted that several options are available to help taxpayers prepare for the 2014 tax season and get their refunds as easily as possible. New year-end tax planning information has been added to IRS.gov this week.
In addition, many software companies are expected to begin accepting tax returns in January and hold those returns until the IRS systems open on Jan. 31. More details will be available in January.
The IRS cautioned that it will not process any tax returns before Jan. 31, so there is no advantage to filing on paper before the opening date. Taxpayers will receive their tax refunds much faster by using e-file or Free File with the direct deposit option.
The April 15 tax deadline is set by statute and will remain in place. However, the IRS reminds taxpayers that anyone can request an automatic six-month extension to file their tax return. The request is easily done with Form 4868, which can be filed electronically or on paper.
IRS systems, applications and databases must be updated annually to reflect tax law updates, business process changes and programming updates in time for the start of the filing season.
The October closure came during the peak period for preparing IRS systems for the 2014 filing season. Programming, testing and deployment of more than 50 IRS systems is needed to handle processing of nearly 150 million tax returns. Updating these core systems is a complex, year-round process with the majority of the work beginning in the fall of each year."
17,/minnesota/edenprairie/paulsen-touts-small-brew-act-at-lucid-brewing-edenprairie,2014-01-08T14:36:31Z,Paulsen Touts Small BREW Act at Lucid Brewing,0,0,James Warden,Patch Staff,"Third District Congressman Erik Paulsen (R-MN) stopped by Lucid Brewing in Minnetonka to discuss a bill he's cosponsoring that aims to help the microbrew industry by reducing federal excise taxes on start-up breweries.
Paulsen—whose district includes Eden Prairie, Edina, Maple Grove, Minnetonka, Plymouth and several Lake Minnetonka communities—toured the brewery with Lucid Co-owner Jon Messier and the owners of Bad Weather Brewery and Badger Hill Brewery, which share the facility with Lucid.
The Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce (BREW) Act, which was introduced by Reps. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) and Richard E. Neal (D-MA) on Feb. 5, would halve the excise tax on the first 60,000 barrels—from $7 to $3.5 per barrel—and institute a new rate of $16 per barrel on beer production from 60,000 barrels up to 2 million barrels. Breweries that produce 6 million barrels or less annually would see a savings from the tax breaks.
Small BREW Act supporters say the bill would help an industry that's become a significant part of the state's economy. In 2012, Minnesota's 143 brewers and beer wholesalers contributed to 34,760 jobs, paid $665,400,000 in taxes and had a total economic impact of about $4 billion, according to the Beer Institute.
 ""The brewery started with two employees, my partner Eric Biermann and me,"" a release quoted Jon Messier. ""In two years we have grown the business to having ten full-time employees and six part-time employees. As a small company we are always looking to hire talented people to help us grow the brewery. A reduction in Federal taxes allows us to do this. We'll be able to hire more employees at competitive wages and offer benefits to existing employees that we could otherwise not afford.""

The new law, sponsored by Rep. Linda Slocum (DFL-Richfield) and Sen. Barb Goodwin (DFL-Columbia Heights) is the first to regulate estate sales by requiring operators to offer a surety bond. Certified public accountants and licensed attorneys, however, are exempt.

Home sellers must disclose radon gas testing
A requirement for home sellers to disclose radon testing is one of the major provisions contained in the omnibus health policy law sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Laine (DFL-Columbia Heights) and Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville).
Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, and one in three Minnesota homes pose a risk from the odorless, tasteless gas, said Laine. The law will not mandate testing or mitigation, rather, a Department of Health radon awareness brochure will be given to the 40,000 annual homebuyers across he state at the point of sale. If the seller has knowledge of radon in the home, that information must be disclosed to the buyer. The so-called Radon Awareness Act also requires the seller to hand over records pertaining to radon testing or mitigation of the residence, if available.
There are some exclusions to the disclosure requirement, such as property transferred due to divorce, foreclosure, death of a family member or when no money is transferred.

Under current law, the state emergency response center or a firefighting or law enforcement organization must be notified when a reportable quantity of a hazardous or extremely hazardous substance is released or spilled. There is no requirement to notify local jurisdictions.
Sponsored by Rep. Dan Schoen (DFL-St. Paul Park) and Sen. Katie Sieben (DFL-Newport), a new law requires the state emergency response center to notify a local 911 emergency dispatch center within 24 hours of the notification, unless ""the situation requires an immediate response or the area is unknown to the center."" Then, the state emergency response center shall direct the caller to contact local authorities.

Since 2009, state law has banned a public employer from inquiring whether a job applicant has a criminal record or criminal history at the time a person applies for a job.
Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Bobby Joe Champion (DFL-Mpls) sponsor the so-called Ban the Box law, which will add private employers to those who must wait until an applicant is selected for an interview to ask the question.
The law will remove the question that asks job applicants to check a box about whether they have ever been convicted of a felony or gross misdemeanor. For jobs that don't include an interview, employers cannot ask about criminal issues until there is a conditional offer of employment.
Employers who violate the new law within the first year will be subject to a written warning after their first offense, followed by cash penalties for any subsequent violations.

An estimated 40,000 additional low-wage earners and their families may qualify for Medical Assistance coverage as a result of a new law that extends coverage to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, including a standard 5 percent income disregard, or about $15,000 per year.
Rep. Thomas Huntley (DFL-Duluth) and Sen. Kathy Sheran (DFL-Mankato) sponsor the law that allows the state to exercise its option under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to expand Medical Assistance.
The federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost for adults without children who qualify through 2016. Beginning in 2017, the federal government will gradually reduce that support to 90 percent of the cost for 2020 and subsequent years.In addition to the newly eligible, thousands of people currently enrolled in the state-offered MinnesotaCare health insurance program are expected to shift to the expanded Medical Assistance program. The law transfers about $63.6 million from the Health Care Access Fund to the General Fund in the 2014-15 biennium to cover the cost of insuring some MinnesotaCare enrollees who are not eligible for the full federal funding under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Rep. Tim Mahoney (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Chuck Wiger (DFL-Maplewood) sponsor a new law that aims to expand licensing and regulatory provisions as they relate to scrap metal and scrapped vehicle purchases.
While Aug. 1, 2013, was the effective date for much of a larger law to prevent stolen cars from quickly becoming scrap metal, scrap vehicle operators must install and maintain video surveillance cameras at their operations, effective Jan. 1, 2014. Additionally, still digital cameras or similar devices must be positioned to clearly photograph the face of each seller of a scrap vehicle who enters the location. The scrap vehicle operator shall also photograph the seller's vehicle, including license plate. Any video must be shown to law enforcement, upon request.

Currently the average self-response rate in Eden Prairie is 81.9%. The Census Bureau will visit the remaining households to collect responses in person. To avoid a knock on your door, complete the census today online, by phone or by mail.
Census takers are hired from our area, and their goal is to help residents and everyone in their home be counted in the 2020 Census.
If someone visits to collect information for the 2020 Census, check to make sure they have a valid ID badge with their photograph, a U.S. Department of Commerce watermark and an expiration date. Census workers may also carry Census Bureau bags and other equipment with the Census Bureau logo.
According to the U.S. Census, census takers will wear masks and follow local public health guidelines when they visit your home. All census takers complete a virtual COVID-19 training on physical distancing and other health and safety protocols before beginning their work in neighborhoods.
The census taker will ask residents simple questions about everyone who was living in the household on April 1, 2020. The visit takes about 5 to 10 minutes. Everything said to a census taker is confidential under federal law and cannot be shared with anyone, including any government agency. Census responses can never be used against residents in any way.
If the census taker who visits doesn't speak the language of the household, the resident may request a return visit [PDF] from a census taker who does speak their language. If no one is home when the census taker visits, the census taker will leave a notice of their visit with information about how to complete the census.
Data collection ends Sept. 30, 2020. Self-response options will also close on that date.
Visit 2020census.gov for more information.

""While I definitely wouldn't categorize 2020 as a banner year, it certainly has been a significant one that has affected us all in unique and challenging ways. And who would ever have predicted we'd be conducting a major election during a pandemic!
We are fortunate in Eden Prairie to have such experienced, thoughtful and skilled City employees running our elections. I am so proud of how smoothly the voting process, tabulation and reporting of our results occurred. Our community can take pride in this accomplishment!
Our elections team, led by City Clerk Kathleen Porta, always does an amazing job and 2020 was no exception. Planning began over a year ago, which includes recruiting, hiring and training residents as election judges, coordinating with our precinct locations, handling logistics for processing and delivering ballots to Hennepin County, and responding to residents with questions, among many other responsibilities. In addition to these typical activities, plans were continually adjusted as rules and health and safety guidelines changed due to the pandemic, including a court ruling five days before Election Day.
This year, 15 election judges worked tirelessly through six weeks of in-person absentee voting at City Center, processing up to 1,200 voters a day, and on Election Day, 328 election judges staffed Eden Prairie's 20 precincts. I wish I could personally thank each and every one of you who helped our community conduct a major election despite the challenges associated with the pandemic. We all owe you a debt of gratitude for your service!
The election could not have gone so smoothly without the efforts of many other staff members from across all City departments and support areas, from Public Works to Information Technology and Facilities to Public Safety. Simply put, our City employees are the best around!
I would also like to commend our residents for their outstanding level of participation in this election. A record for Eden Prairie was set with 89% voter turnout that included 63% of eligible residents having voted early or absentee. While at times the lines were long for early voters, everyone waited patiently to exercise their right to vote.
Thank you to all of the candidates who campaigned to serve our community at every level. Making the decision to run for office is a life-changing experience that shows how much you truly care about your neighbors and our children's future. Whether you won or lost, your participation helped diversify the conversation which is necessary for our democracy to thrive.
And finally, congratulations to Council Member PG Narayanan who will retain his seat and Lisa Toomey for being elected to her first term on the City Council. I look forward to you both joining me and Council Members Kathy Nelson and Mark Freiberg as together we continue the good work of serving our residents beginning Jan. 5, 2021. By any measure, Eden Prairie is a strong, healthy, vibrant and thriving community. Along with my Council colleagues, I feel so honored and fortunate to be leading this City during these exciting and definitely challenging times knowing that, at the end of the day, Eden Prairie's success will always be built on the resolute strength and compassion of its people.""
With Gratitude,

Mayor Ron Case
