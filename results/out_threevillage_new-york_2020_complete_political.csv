Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that the federal government canceled a grant that awarded billions of dollars to the state's health care system, costing Long Island hospitals millions.
In 2014, the state won an $8 billion grant from the federal government to transition health care services from being primarily hospital-driven to being more community-based. The goal was to decrease health care costs.
The state had already been awarded $7.4 billion of the money, but Cuomo said he found out late last week that the federal government was cutting off the last $600 million of the grant.
""This past Friday we learned of the Trump administration's latest assault on the state of New York — $8 billion in cuts to our healthcare system,"" Cuomo said in a release. ""Healthcare should be beyond politics and it is unconscionable that the federal administration is politicizing the lives of New Yorkers — primarily senior citizens. Make no mistake: New York will marshal all our allies, including our congressional delegation, to fight these cuts tooth and nail until New York receives the full funding we deserve.""
Stony Brook University Hospital is one of the two institutions impacted on Long Island. The cuts are taking away $21,289,481 from the hospital. The projects the funds were earmarked for were planned but had not yet begun, Newsday reported.
Nassau University Medical Center is losing out on $52,577,847."

Voters will elect Democrat challenger Will Ferraro or Republican incumbent Ed Romaine.
Patch reached out to both candidates to hear where they stand on important issues affecting the community.
Here are the responses for those who participated. The answers have been lightly edited for clarity.
Will Ferraro
The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
""Recycling and long-term waste reduction. My 6-Point Plan would make recycling easier and divert waste to the recycling bin by switching Brookhaven to a weekly recycling schedule for all streams, and restoring curbside glass pickup. I would eliminate waste pickup from the property tax bill and treat garbage pickup like a utility, incentivizing household waste reduction and recycling practices, saving taxpayers money, and reducing our town's trash output by an estimated 45 percent. This would save the town a significant amount of money, and help to solve the financial component of the landfill's 2024 closure.""
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
""I'm proposing innovative solutions to a number of major Town issues such as road infrastructure, recycling, waste reduction, air quality at the landfill site, and reform at the animal shelter. I believe in a town that serves middle class and working poor families on Main Street. My opponent has put our Town at the mercy of rating agencies on Wall Street. When confronted with these problems, he says we can't solve them, or they are problems that belong to somebody else. I believe in leading from in-front, and taking our biggest challenges head-on.""
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)?
""Supervisor Ed Romaine failed to get ahead of the single-stream recycling collapse, which happened a full year before the Town lost its contract with Green Stream. The result is a botched, confused recycling system that people have stopped participating in. Our road infrastructure is among the worst in New York State, and our Supervisor refuses to work in any meaningful way with the Highway Department to solve the problem. When residents in towns surrounding the landfill confront him about odor emissions, he tells them the odors have gotten better. And currently, there is no significant plan to deal with the closure of the landfill in 2024. This is unacceptable, and it's why I ran: to pose detailed solutions to these problems.""
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform:
""Buildings Department needs more employees and a streamlined online applications process, as well as a crackdown on politically-connected expeditors. The Brookhaven Animal Shelter is in desperate need of a second site, and a full-time vet (or two part-time vets) to perform spay and neuter services, so that we can reduce the feral cat population. From overzealous code enforcement, to the problem of demolished zombie homes being left to turn into overgrown zombie lots, and the number of Town contractors donating big money to incumbent politicians, there are a number of fronts requiring the attention of a reform government. I plan to lead such a government.""
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
""I have over 15 years of experience in government, non-profit, and community organizing. I lived in Albany for two years while I worked as a legislative analyst for the NY State Assembly; I also spent time working for the State Senate. For the past seven years, I've worked for a major New York City department as a speechwriter, policy advisor, and manager of large, million dollar public contracts. In my community, I serve on the Middle Country School Board's legislative outreach committee, owned a small business, and have spent the better part of two years organizing through Brookhaven Action Network, where I led the fight against Brookhaven's Toxic Term Extension, which unfortunately extended the terms of Brookhaven politicians from 2 years to 4 years. I've worked at all levels of government, remain a constant voice and advocate for my community, and understand how to solve problems.""
The best advice ever shared with me was...
""When making a plan, don't work backwards from your perceived limitations. Design the plan the way you want, and find ways to move past or around the limits.""
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
""I'm a fierce advocate for people. Even if we disagree, I'll always give you the time of day because I believe nothing we do matters without participation and dialogue from the community."""

When it comes to the waste generated by single-use plastics and polystyrene, the plastics crisis is more urgent than people realize, and Suffolk must clean-up its act according to members of the county's Single-Use Plastic Reduction Task Force who unveiled four proposals intended to achieve that goal. Led by Suffolk County Legislator Kara Hahn who serves as chairperson of the task force, the group outlined regulations directed at both businesses and the County itself that ban the use of polystyrene food service products and sale of polystyrene packaging; require restaurants to provide biodegradable straws and stirrers by request only while disallowing plastic ones; prohibit County concessionaires from distributing single-use cups, utensils or beverage straws made from non-biodegradable substances and require the County to install water fountains designed to allow bottle filling at most of its facilities.
If fully adopted by the Legislature, implementation of these policy changes would be staggered with the polystyrene ban taking effect approximately three months after its approval; the straws and stirrers policy beginning on January 1, 2020; the County concessionaire prohibition on single use plastic being included in all future license agreements; and existing water fountains being replaced as they age.
""Today we announce policies that will come to define our County's environmental legacy for generations to come,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""The vast and growing scale of the worldwide plastics problem has become a growing threat to human health. We as a County have worked, in some cases decades, to address the challenges posed by these dangerous pollutants. Now, with the backing of science and evolving public awareness, support for policies limiting and banning substances that threaten human health and our environment has reached a turning point. It's time to take a stand against this growing threat.""
Specifically being proposed is a ban of polystyrene food service products including plates, cups, containers and trays and loose fill packaging; a disallowance of providing single use, non-biodegradable plastic straws and stirrers with environmental friendly alternatives only allowed upon customer request; replacing existing water fountains with ones designed to allow bottle filling at County facilities that have ten or more employees and parks that include water dispensers; and including a requirement that concessionaire license agreements awarded by the County after the bill's passage include a restriction on the use of plastic and non-biodegradable cups, utensils and beverage straws.
The bills make accommodations for people with disabilities whose medical conditions necessitate use of plastic straws. Additionally, the polystyrene ban exempts items used to store uncooked eggs, raw meat, pork, fish, seafood and poultry.
The impacts of plastic and polystyrene waste on our environment are well documented. According to the not-for-profit Ocean Conservancy, ""Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments."" As a result, ingested plastic has been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and in 100% of sea turtles species. While this has been devastating to marine life and ocean ecosystems, the impacts of plastic and, in particular, polystyrene are also a tangible threat to human health. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has classified styrene as a potential human carcinogen and the Environmental Protection Agency says the polystyrene manufacturing process is the fifth largest creator of hazardous waste in the United States. Furthermore, said Hahn, ""in recent years, minute micro-plastics and fibers, measuring the width of a human hair or far less, have been found in an extraordinary range of products, such as honey and sugar, shellfish, bottled and tap water, beer, processed foods, table salt and soft drinks, which means that just like the sea turtles and birds, we humans are ingesting plastic virtually every day.""
This won't be the County's first attempt to improve our environment by banning these plastics. In 1988 Suffolk, which had already long been respected for its environmental stewardship, hoped to ban Styrofoam use by supermarkets and fast-food restaurants to protect air quality and groundwater from the ""hazards and toxicity"" associated with their disposal. Unfortunately, that policy was reversed a year later due to a procedural issue. In 2013, Legislator Hahn had introduced a polystyrene ban that did not pass the legislature.
""It's been 30 years since Suffolk first sounded the alarm on the dangers of single use plastic,"" said Hahn. ""During those three decades, not a single piece of plastic has biodegraded. We must reduce use now or suffer the consequences for generations to come.""
Dr. Rebecca Grella, a research scientist and educator in the Brentwood Union Free School District agreed, ""My students and I have found a significant amount of plastic in the salt marshes we study. We have plastic from the 1990's as evidence from the bottle caps we are finding. There is a tremendous amount of plastic in these marshes and we need a solution.""
Later this afternoon, each of the initiatives will be assigned to a committee with the polystyrene ban and the by-request-only requirement, which are local laws, expected to be taken up by the Health Committee; the concessionaire bill to be considered by the Parks and Recreation Committee and finally, the water dispenser proposal to be put before the Public Works Committee. The earliest the proposals can be approved by the Legislature will be March 5th for the non-local laws and March 26th for others that require a public hearing.
According to Beth Fiteni, Director of Green Inside and Out, a Long Island based nonprofit organization that promotes living environmentally consciously, ""Each one of us makes a difference with our daily actions. While no one step is the whole solution to preventing plastic pollution, these proactive steps being considered by the Suffolk County legislature on polystyrene, plastic straws, and refilling water bottles show strong leadership towards reducing waste and protecting our oceans, rivers and lakes.""
A sentiment shared by Colleen Henn, Clean Water Coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation, ""Suffolk County Legislators are stepping up to protect the environment and human health by introducing bills that reduce plastics pollution. The three laws proposed by Legislator Hahn and the Single Use Plastics Reduction Task Force smartly focus on preventing plastics from being introduced to the environment in the first place. By providing plastic straws by request only, prohibiting polystyrene foam, and providing water bottle re-fill stations at county buildings, parks, and establishments, the County is using an upstream approach to get ourselves out of this plastic mess we have created. If these laws pass, it will be a hat-trick for the health of our oceans and Surfrider Foundation's members will definitely be celebrating!""
""How do you conquer a world-wide crisis?"" asked Legislator Hahn. ""One local County at a time if necessary. An island, like Long Island, surrounded by the ocean and the Sound with water so intricately tided to our life and our identity, should be at the forefront of this issue, not wait to be last in line.""
""The negative impacts to our environment and public health, due to plastic pollution, is a problem that will continue to worsen with time. Taking action now is imperative if we are going to effectively reverse the growing crisis. I commend Legislator Hahn for her work on this issue,"" concluded Legislator William R. Spencer.
The Single-Use Plastic Reduction Taskforce was created in 2018 by Legislator Hahn through Resolution 92-2018, which was co-sponsored by Legislator Tom Muratore. The Task Force was established to recommend strategy for reducing the use of plastic products and examine ways to increase recycling so plastics that are used won't end up polluting our environment. As its first initiative, the Task Force launched ""Strawless Suffolk,"" an effort to convince restaurants to voluntarily stop using plastic straws. To date, almost 100 eateries have taken the pledge. Members of the task force include: Legislator Hahn; Southampton Town Council Woman Julie Lofstad; Kaitlin Willig, a Research Oceanographer with Stony Brook University; Christopher Sortino of the Suffolk County Department of Health Services; Dr. John Galitotos, Sr. Associate Vice President for Workforce Development, Community Partnerships, & STEM/CTE at Suffolk County Community College; Science Writer Erica Cirino; and Beth Fiteni and Colleen Henn."

The generous spirit of Long Island will be ""illuminated"" this Friday during the virtual fundraising event dubbed ""One Island Giving Day."" To celebrate, Suffolk County has lighted its H. Lee Dennison Building in blue during a ceremony yesterday afternoon to mark the single day, online fundraiser to benefit local nonprofit organizations that support the people who live, work and study in our communities.
This is the second annual ""One Island Giving Day"" and is a legacy of the Amy and Horace Hagedorn Foundation that supported numerous Long Island nonprofits until it closed last year. In 2017, the effort raised over $325,000 to benefit more than 100 nonprofits that serve Nassau and Suffolk residents, with ""One Island Giving Day"" offering local nonprofits the unique opportunity to be supported by their neighbors across Long Island. This year, organizers hope to raise $1 million for the almost 100 registered local nonprofit organizations that assist fellow Long Islanders. The virtual event will be hosted at oneislandgiving.org and donations can be made now through October 26th.
Tonight's event was made possible through the bipartisan support of Suffolk County Legislators Kara Hahn, Leslie Kennedy and Susan Berland who sponsored legislation last month to mark One Island Giving Day and illuminate the H. Lee Dennison Building to remind all county residents to support this initiative.
""Long Island has a rich and vibrant nonprofit community that supports so many of the families, children, and communities who live and work here"", said One Island Giving Day Campaign Director, Cindy Morris. ""This concept of bringing together one day in which we drive Long Islanders to support these organizations is so important, as we work together to make our communities safer, stronger and more diverse. I am thrilled to be involved in this project.""
OIGD, founded by the Hagedorn Foundation, is a branded program that supports Long Island nonprofits long into the future. ""One Island Giving Day was Hagedorn Foundation's final parting gift to the Long Island Not-For-Profit at the point of the Foundation's planned spend-down in 2017,"" said Hagedorn Foundation President, Lisa Valentine. ""It was my mother, Amy Maiello Hagedorn's wish that the community band together to keep Long Island's vital programs alive and thriving in her absence. She had begun the seeds of the process for One Island Giving Day during what would turn out to be the last year of her life. What a legacy she left us in One Island Giving Day!""
Money raised benefits nonprofits working in areas of need, including arts and culture, education, immigration, environment, children and families, healthcare, LGBT, civic engagement, and many others. Donors visiting oneislandgiving.org can search by topics to make a tax-deductible donation to the causes that matter most to them. For those looking to make a more general donation, a ""Love Them All"" option is also available. All money raised will be spent locally on Long Island.
""Our nonprofits fall into all issue areas. You can visit oneislandgiving.org and support the nonprofit of your choice,"" says Steering Committee member, Devon Giordano. ""We hope Long Islanders will make a donation and directly help the communities around them.""
The campaign is created by the Hagedorn Foundation in partnership with area nonprofits. For a complete list of One Island Giving Day's participating nonprofits and sponsors please visit oneislandgiving.org.
To donate to One Island Giving Day, please go to oneislandgiving.org now through October 26th. All of the nonprofits involved do all or a significant portion of their work on Long Island."

Citing a lack of standardized protocols throughout the County's hospital emergency rooms for patients who've overdosed on opioids, the Suffolk Legislature last night approved the creation of a 13 member panel to draft recommendations for treating the addiction component of an overdose in patients. The bill sponsored by the Legislature's Majority Leader Kara Hahn and Legislator William Spencer will create a working group comprised of health department officials, hospital representatives and addiction experts charged with developing a model of best practices that emergency departments can voluntarily implement. The group will have seven months to put together its guidelines that the Suffolk County Department of Health Services will then provide to hospitals. Following the initial protocol's distribution, members will continue to convene annually to consider revisions or additions to the guidance.
While emergency rooms are primarily designed to treat the immediate toxicological aspects of an overdose, hospitals often follow post-opioid overdose protocols that may include offering overdose prevention education, naloxone and related training for patients, family members, and friends; linking patients to treatment and services in the community and starting Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) of Opioid Addiction including use of Methadone and Suboxone. Currently, New York State doesn't prescribe uniform recommendations on post-overdose treatment of patients, leaving decisions on the type of services to provide, or not provide, to individual hospitals across the state.
""Being brought back to life from an overdose is about as rock bottom as it can get for an addict, but the realization that you have been granted another chance at life is perhaps the ideal point to begin rebuilding,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""Ensuring every hospital in Suffolk has a set of effective protocols dealing with overdose and addiction that focuses on best practices for success will provide all in this County a better shot at overcoming addition.""
""I applaud Legislator Hahn for her leadership on this critical issue. By bringing together experts in the health care and addiction fields to develop the best practices and model protocols for our emergency departments, we can help save lives and put addicts on the path toward long term recovery,"" stated Legislator William R. Spencer, MD.
Research has consistently linked the types of post-overdose care provided in emergency departments with the continuation of addiction treatment following release. A 2015 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association of three different interventions methods used for opioid-dependent patients who visited one emergency department found that 78 percent of patients who received highly integrated services inclusive of MAT were still in treatment 30 days following discharge compared to just 37 percent who received just a pamphlet listing contact information for available addiction counseling services.
According to Executive Director Steve Chassman ,""The Long Island Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (LICADD) commends Legislator Kara Hahn and her colleagues in the Suffolk County Legislature, for addressing the disparities in protocols surrounding overdose victims in our communities and local medical facilities. Thank you Legislator Hahn for inquiring with a cross section of professionals to assess where the gaps in services exist and allowing the medical and human service professionals to develop concrete protocols focusing on how to best assist individuals and families who experience near fatal overdoses in Suffolk County. This important piece of legislation will positively impact a multitude of individuals and families in Suffolk County suffering from the ravages of a substance use disorder.""
Dr. Jeffrey L. Reynolds of Family and Children's Association added, ""As we begin to turn the corner in Suffolk's heroin and opioid crisis, we must make sure that those who land in emergency rooms following an overdose get timely and comprehensive care that reflects the latest clinical protocols. An overdose and subsequent trip to the emergency room is traumatic, but if managed correctly with proper intervention, care and support can provide a life-changing shot at recovery. Legislator Hahn was among the first to advocate for increased naloxone availability several years ago and we are pleased that her quest to save lives continues with this excellent piece of legislation."""

Eager to get local restaurants to declare their independence from plastic straws this summer and beyond, Legislator Kara Hahn (D-Setauket), members of the County's Single Use Plastic Reduction Task Force and leading environmental advocates today called on Suffolk eateries to go straw-less through a countywide initiative intended to reduce single-use plastic straw waste originating from these establishments. Dubbed Strawless Suffolk, the initiative's launch coincides with the start of the summer vacation season, and organizers hope to convince restaurants to stop ""grasping at straws"" during a time when their business and plastic straw use increases exponentially.
The initial goal for Strawless Suffolk organizers will be to convince 100 restaurants in seaside downtowns like Bellport, Greenport, Huntington, Northport, Patchogue, and Port Jefferson Village, who rely upon pristine waterfronts, to take a pledge this summer to stop using plastic straws. Restaurants that agree to take the pledge will be provided with a decal to identify the establishments as a Strawless Suffolk participating restaurant. To be eligible for recognition, restaurants can elect to pursue one or all of three scenarios: stop using straws completely; provide biodegradable straws made from paper or bamboo upon request; and/or provide reusable straws made of stainless steel or glass. Twenty-five restaurants have already agreed to take the pledge, including the Purple Elephant in Northport, where Strawless Suffolk today held its kick-off announcement.
In Suffolk County, which boasts some of America's most beautiful beaches, a thousand miles of shoreline, and waterways teaming with marine life, the innocuous plastic straw has become a tangible threat to the county's tourist driven economy, littering our beaches with debris and threatening turtles, birds and other marine life.
Every day, Americans discard a half a billion plastic straws, many of which find their way into oceans and inland waterways, which to put in perspective, could wrap around the Earth 2.5 times per day. What's more, nearly 90% of all marine debris is made of plastic, including plastic straws.
""The beauty of our beaches and natural landscape is what drives Suffolk County's estimated $5.6 Billion tourist economy,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""And yet, all over the County, our beaches and parks are littered with plastic straws and other plastic debris. What's even more distressing is the suffering these useless bits of plastic inflict on vulnerable wildlife. Suffolk is joining the worldwide movement to save our oceans and beaches, starting right here at home.""
Now, Hahn is partnering with the Surfrider Foundation's Eastern Long Island Chapter, the Suffolk County Single Use Plastic Reduction Task Force she created earlier this year, and leading environmental groups throughout Suffolk to protect our beaches, waterways and marine life from the harm inflicted by these unnecessary byproducts of our disposable society.
Clean Water Coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation and Suffolk County Single Use Plastic Reduction Task Force member Colleen Henn said, ""Surfrider Foundation's Eastern Long Island Chapter launched its Strawless Summer on May 1, 2018 with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of plastic straws used. Since, we have been overwhelmed by the acceptance and success of our initiative. We are heartened to be working alongside Suffolk County Legislator Kara Hahn and a coalition of organizations to implement a county-wide 'Strawless Suffolk.' Surfrider hopes that this movement will encourage a deeper dialog about reducing the prevalence of single-use plastics in our daily lives.""
Dr. John K. Galiotos of Suffolk County Community College who also serves on the task force reported, ""Suffolk County Community College and our Center for Sustainability supports the reduction and use of plastics that eventually enter the waste stream and potentially harm our environment. We should all follow Legislator Hahn's lead and strive for a Strawless Suffolk at the county's parks and beaches and help via education and best practices to preserve our environment and wildlife.""
Plastic straws are available everywhere and often provided without being requested, but more and more cities, countries, corporations and international resorts are making strides to reduce use and/or plastic straws, including Seattle, Washington, which goes Strawless starting this July. The cities of Malibu, San Luis Obispo and Davis in California and Fort Myers Beach, Florida have already gone Strawless. An impressive list of resorts and other major venues have also gone Strawless too, including Smithsonian Institution Museums, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Ikea and the Hilton Waikoloa Village in Hawaii.
According to Kimberly Williams, a Marine Science teacher in the Smithtown School District, ""Plastic straws are one of my marine science classes' top litter finds! When we get served a drink without a straw, my students and I know this is a restaurant we want to patronize-they care about our island home! We say 'Thanks for not putting garbage in my drink!' If my students can do it, so can you! Cheers to the restaurants that sign-on, you will have our loyalty and appreciation!""
Environmental journalist and Single Use Plastic Reduction Task Force member Erica Cirino said, ""As a journalist covering the global story of plastic pollution, I have learned that straws are one of the most common forms of trash on beaches throughout the world. A growing number of municipalities are recognizing their role in reducing the volume of plastic that winds up in the natural environment, including Vancouver, Berkeley, Seattle, Miami Beach and other major cities.""
""Plastic is made from petroleum, and may potentially leach hormone disrupting chemicals, so minimizing its use near our food is a reasonable preventive measure. Since there are paper alternatives and even reusable glass or metal alternatives, there really is no need for these useless bits of plastic,"" said Beth Fiteni, Director of Green Inside and Out.
Earlier this year, Hahn created The Single Use Plastic Reduction Taskforce through Resolution 92-2018, which she co-sponsored along with Legislator Tom Muratore. The Task Force was established to recommend strategy for reducing the use of plastic products and examine ways to increase recycling so plastics that are used won't end up polluting our environment. Strawless Suffolk is the Task Force's first initiative.
As chairperson of the Suffolk County Legislature's Environmental Committee, Hahn has sponsored several pieces of legislation designed to reduce pollution of waterways, including a bill to ban the sale of personal care products containing microbeads that get into the waste stream and pollute waterways, as well as legislation to establish the Plastic Reduction Task Force, and of course, Suffolk County's recent legislation to reduce the impact of plastic bags, which Hahn co-sponsored.
Here in Suffolk, the Surfrider Foundation has sponsored more than two dozen volunteer beach clean-ups that have removed more than 4,000 pounds of trash from our coastal areas."

Suffolk will soon carve a path – a walking path – within its Old Field Farm County Park that will provide visitors with new opportunities to explore and enjoy this historic 13 acre equestrian show ground that runs along the bank of West Meadow Creek in Setauket. Legislators last evening approved allocating up to $60,000 in funding leftover from other completed projects at Old Field Farm for the pathway that will extend approximately 0.4 of a mile from the park's westernmost entrance to its easternmost gate along West Meadow Beach Road and link to a nearly two mile multiuse trail maintained by the Town of Brookhaven on what was once Trustees Road. In addition to the path made of environmentally appropriate crushed stone, the project will also add fencing and a small parking area to accommodate the addition.
Pathway proponent Legislator Kara Hahn who advocated for the project's inclusion in the County's 2018 Capital Program also designed the trail's projected route. For Legislator Hahn this addition will not allow more people to discover this underutilized public parkland, but will also prove walkers, joggers and bicyclists with a safer and more scenic alternative to winding West Meadow Beach Road.
""The majestic scenery and tranquility of the West Meadow Peninsula has long served as a beacon to everyone from exercise enthusiasts to people just looking to detach from the stresses of daily life,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""With so many people attracted to the peninsula's natural beauty and recreational offerings, I felt we needed to link Suffolk County's forgotten gem to the other attractions while also making the experiences safer for visitors who have had to navigate vehicular traffic on narrow, winding roads not designed to safely accommodate both.""
According to Annemarie Waugh of Sidewalks for Safety, ""The addition of a safe walkway to West Meadow Beach will be a tremendous safety benefit to all Three Village walkers, runners, cyclists and drivers and will enhance natural beauty of the area.""
With funding in place, the Suffolk County Parks Department hopes to have the new pathway opened for visitors as early as this fall.
Old Field Farm is a historic Long Island show ground constructed by philanthropist Ward Melville who commissioned famed architect Richard Haviland Smythe to create this unique equestrian facility located on a distinctive waterfront setting along Long Island's North Shore. Originally known as the North Shore Horse Show Grounds, Old Field Farm opened in 1931 and is located on 13 scenic acres that adjoin 88 acres of protected wetlands overlooking Long Island Sound on the north and the West Meadow Creek wetlands to the south. The park was acquired by Suffolk County in 1986 and is managed through a partnership with Old Field Farm Ltd."

Every day, nearly 100 Americans are killed by gun violence, and many more sustain firearm injuries. In an effort to honor those whose lives have been cut short and the countless survivors injured, Suffolk kicked off a nearly week-long illumination of the County's H. Lee Dennison headquarters that began with a ceremony on Friday evening June 1st. Through legislation approved in earlier this year, Suffolk designated the following day, Saturday, June 2nd as ""Gun Violence Awareness"" Day.
Legislators Kara Hahn, Monica Martinez and Presiding Officer DuWayne Gregory, who sponsored the legislation, were joined by gun violence survivors Shenee Johnson and Paul Guttenberg, prevention advocates Jeff Keister and Gemma Saylor, and Suffolk Community College student Sabrina Spotorno, at an illumination ceremony, during which the county office building was illuminated in orange. The building will be illuminated until Tuesday, June 5th.
In 2013, the color orange became associated with gun violence when teens at a Chicago high school honored their murdered classmate by wearing orange; the color hunters wear in the woods to protect themselves from being shot by mistake, a color that came to represent the value of human life. Now, five years later, as gun violence continues to take the lives of students in school settings, that small gesture has grown into the ""Wear Orange"" campaign, a coalition of more than 500 non-profits, cultural influencers and elected officials working to reduce gun violence in America. One of those groups, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures to protect people from gun violence while respecting the Second Amendment, partnered with Suffolk County to spearhead the ""Wear Orange"" awareness campaign.
The tragic mass murders of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are among the many deaths by gun violence that happen every day in the United States,"" said Legislator Kara Hahn. ""No child, no family, no school or community should have to go through the nightmare of a mass murder. These deaths are preventable. We remember and honor the victims through this remembrance, but also recommit ourselves to push lawmakers in Washington D. C. to enact comprehensive legislation to prevent gun violence. ""
""The tremendous toll that gun violence has taken on our country, our citizens and specifically our young students is a constant reminder of how lawmakers in Washington have failed as representatives of the people,"" said Suffolk County Legislature Presiding Officer DuWayne Gregory. ""Their inaction is responsible for the many, many lives that have been lost. Allowing guns in the hands of people who should not have them, permitting assault weapons, failing to complete background checks and concealed carry laws are not what the majority of Americans want. We need leaders who have the backbone to pass laws that protect our people without concern for their reelection. I continue to hope that remembrances such as this will ignite a desire to do the right thing.""
""Continuing to lose children to gun violence and do nothing is unacceptable. Entire families have been shattered,"" said Legislator Martinez. ""It's critical that we raise awareness about the true cost of gun violence and continue to demand action from our representatives in Washington. Today's ceremony may seem like a small gesture, but out of small gestures can grow great change.""
The theme of Wear Orange 2018 is ""Use Your Voice."" Moms Demand Action believes that this is a moment for all Americans to come together and declare that we can--and we will--create a future free of gun violence,"" said Jeff Keister, a volunteer with the Suffolk chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.
In 2013, Legislator Hahn authored legislation requiring Suffolk County law enforcement agencies to cross reference the names and addresses of individuals undergoing a psychiatric crisis and transported to Stony Brook University's Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) against Suffolk County's pistol license registries. If there is a match between a name or home address and the registry, that information will automatically be provided to the respective pistol licensing bureau, where an investigation can be made regarding suspension or revocation of the license.
""In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre, we passed common sense legislation in Suffolk to limit access to firearms when certain risk factors are present,"" said Hahn. ""The time is long past due for action at the national level."""

November 21, 2017; Stony Brook, NY –At a recent meeting held by Nassau Suffolk Water Commissioners' Association (NSWCA), which consists of commissioners representing 21 water districts from across Nassau and Suffolk counties, distinguished guest speaker Dr. Harold Walker, Stony Brook University Professor and Chair of the Department of Civil Engineering, as well as New York State Center for Clean Water Technology Co-Director, presented Long Island water commissioners with a detailed overview of contamination 1,4 dioxane, a synthetic chemical commonly found in TCE groundwater plumes, as part of the Association's ongoing Educational Series.
During his presentation, Dr. Walker stressed the need to provide meaningful data to accelerate action and facilitate effective solutions for the welfare of all Long Island residents. He also explained how there are currently no chemical-specific Federal or New York State drinking water standards for 1,4 dioxane even though it is regulated as an Unspecified Organic contaminant by New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). Also during the meeting, Dr. Walker outlined the Center's new New York State supported initiative that is focused on the research and development of technology to remove emerging contaminants from drinking water.
""The New York State Center for Clean Water Technology will be issuing a request for proposals for the pilot testing of new technology for the removal of 1,4-dioxane from drinking water."" Dr. Walker stated. He further commented that the Center is also actively involved in the development of innovative, onsite wastewater treatment technology for denitrification to remove nitrogen from wastewater.
""The NSWCA welcomes experts like Dr. Walker as we continually seek to monitor, protect and preserve our environment and public health,"" said NSWCA President and Plainview Water District Commissioner Andrew Bader. ""The issue of 1,4 dioxane, which is a chemical often found in TCE groundwater plumes, reaches beyond drinking water and is considered an matter for all water supply systems because its presence is so pervasive in everyday household products. This is why it is important that we continue to have discussions about 1,4 dioxane and explore the development of technologies for its removal.""
Organized and chartered in 1981, the Nassau Suffolk Water Commissioners' Association (NSWCA) is comprised of water commissioners from 21 Nassau County and Suffolk County water districts. The NSWCA is dedicated to promoting environmental excellence and best practices as well as maintaining the highest standards of water quality and supply. The NSWCA sponsors regular educational meetings on topics that include the environment, security, economics, rules and regulations, among other related issues.

Suffolk County Legislator Kara Hahn was presented with a ""Champion for Children and Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention"" award by Parents for Megan's Law and the Crime Victims Center. The recognition came during the organization's 2016 Champion for Children and Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention Awards Gala held on December 8, 2016 in Hauppauge.
Legislator Hahn's work on behalf of children and victims of abuse began more than two decades ago when she was a Public Policy Coordinator for a child care advocacy organization in the City of Philadelphia. As Legislator, Majority Leader Hahn has supported the County's ""Community Protection Act"" that increased monitoring of convicted sex offenders' compliance with registration requirements and residency restrictions (Resolution 13-2013); developed a County policy to ensure the safety of children in child care facilities (Resolution 214-2013) and sponsored legislation to protect victims of domestic violence by enforcing orders of protection using GPS monitoring (Resolution 402-2015) and educating victims about their risk of repeated violence (Resolution 175-2015)."

New York State officials this week announced Suffolk will be awarded $60,000 in funding through the Regional Economic Development Council for the creation of a county-wide Blueway Trail. According to the proposal, during this first phase Suffolk County, in partnership with towns, villages, and paddling organizations, will develop a Blueway Trail plan for the North and South Shores as well as the Peconic Estuary. The plan will include a schematic design of the trail route, potential launch/landing locations, draft signage, project identification for public access and facilities, and an implementation plan.
The application submitted by the County earlier this year was based upon a recreational water trail plan being developed by Suffolk Legislator Kara Hahn for her north shore district. However, that preliminary plan was expanded by Legislator Hahn and working group members to include the entire County after reviewing the economic benefits and increased tourism that a more comprehensive blueway trail would provide to the region. In June, Legislator Hahn sponsored bi-partisan legislation that authorized the County to pursue the State funding to support the project.
""For generations, Long Island has attracted both visitors from across the globe and international acclaim because of its shoreline of world-class beaches. However, as more and more tourists seek-out off-shore recreational activities like canoeing, windsurfing and stand-up water paddling, there isn't any reason why Suffolk County's lure should end at the water's edge,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""Once complete, this project will help drive new opportunities for regional tourism and serve as a catalyst to the local economy as our residents and those vacationing here discover that Suffolk is amazing both on and off shore.""
""The funding for the Blueway Trail plan is a significant breakthrough for Suffolk County's local economy and regional tourism industry, and I commend Legislator Kara Hahn for her dedication to securing these critical funds in order to expedite the planning process,"" said Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone. ""We have implemented numerous economic development initiatives throughout this year that have shown a consistent growth and strengthening of our local economy, and I look forward to continuing to work with our leaders in the legislature, in the county and throughout New York State in order to create the opportunities that make Suffolk County the ideal region for our residents and visitors.""
""Tourism is a $5.5 billion industry on Long Island, which translates to more than $356 million in local and state tax revenues for Suffolk County,"" said Kristen Jarnagin, president/CEO of Discover Long Island. ""We applaud Legislator Hahn in her effort to develop the new Blueway Trail that reflects the beauty of our destination and will assist in meeting the demand of our 9.1 million annual visitors""
""The Suffolk Blueway Trail will be a real benefit to prospective, novice and experienced kayakers alike. The Long Island Paddlers commend Suffolk County Legislator, Kara Hahn, for spearheading the efforts to create this trail, and New York State for recognizing the economic potential of such a plan,"" said Long Island Paddlers, Inc. President Steve Berner.
New York State established 10 Regional Economic Development Councils, including the Long Island Regional Council to help jumpstart the economy and create jobs across the State. The Councils empower community, business, and academic leaders, as well as members of the public in each region of the state, to develop strategic plans specifically tailored to their region's unique strengths and resources in order to create jobs, improve quality of life and grow the economy. During this most recent round of funding, the Long Island region awarded $62 million in grants that will support 101 projects, including the Suffolk County Blueway Trail Plan."

The views expressed here are the author's own.
The Suffolk County Legislature has given the Suffolk County Traffic and Parking Violations Agency (SCTPVA) up to 90 days to develop a payment program for the fines it levies to ticketed motorists. The directive gives the agency three months to develop a proposal that, if approved by the Legislature, would allow non-moving violators to pay their fines in installments rather than as one lump sum due immediately.
The initiative was sponsored by Legislator Kara Hahn (D-Setauket) after receiving an appeal from one of her constituents who was threatened with the suspension of his license after he could not pay his fine in full.
""The revocation of a driver's license should be reserved for violators who endanger public safety, not for someone unable to pay a fine on the day it is imposed,"" said Legislator Hahn.
Unpaid fines, fees and surcharges associated with parking tickets are often not collected or prove costly to collect and can result in lost revenue for Suffolk County's government and taxpayers. Suffolk County currently has $2.3 million in outstanding tickets. The legislator added that a payment plan option is a win-win because it helps struggling Suffolk County citizens meet their obligations to both their families and to the county.
According to Legislator Hahn and Legislator Kate Browning (WFP, Shirley), Chair of the Legislature's Public Safety Committee, punitive measures are intended to be teaching moments, rather than a road to economic ruin.
""I congratulate Legislator Hahn for bringing this issue forward,"" said Browning. ""As a co-sponsor of the bill, I agree that no one should have to make a choice between putting food on the table for their family or paying a fine. Failure to pay causes a person to have a suspended license and potentially lose their employment. A payment plan for middle and low income residents will benefit the resident and the agency.""
""A deterrent should never become a detriment, nor should the sting of a ticket ever become the hunger pains of a child,"" said Legislator Hahn. ""While these fines are supposed to serve as a financial deterrent to behavior that puts the public at risk, when unaffordable penalties are imposed and become due immediately, our residents are forced to make decisions that are counter to our values and to the public interest.""
Violators cited in nearby New York City have the option of paying fines through an installment plan which requires that a portion of the fee be paid at the time of conviction, followed by monthly payments with a 9 percent interest charge until the debt is paid in full. Suffolk eventual plan may take a similar form as the SCTPVA develops its own program.
The directive to the SCTPVA now goes to the County Executive for final approval. Then, once the SCTPVA develops its plan, the Legislature will have an opportunity to evaluate the proposal and decide whether to implement it.
""Punishment without mercy does not serve this county or its residents. I encourage the County Executive to sign this bill as it advances the central tenant of fairness in justice,"" concluded Legislator Hahn."

""We are proud to host Pope Francis here in New York, and we are working to expand mass transit options to ensure that everyone can travel safely and securely during this time,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a press release. ""I encourage anyone planning to be in New York City at that time to plan ahead and check the new travel schedules.""

The LIRR will operate its normal AM and PM peak train service to and from Penn Station. In addition, the LIRR will operate eight additional off-peak westbound trains to Penn Station on Friday, including:
Extra eastbound LIRR trains will be on standby at Penn Station ready to pick up Long Islanders after the Papal Mass at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. Those going to papal events are advised by the MTA to buy round-trip train tickets and MetroCards in advance and to expect train crowding.
""Pope Francis' visit to New York is a significant honor for everyone in our service area, and we are prepared to accommodate additional customers traveling to his events along with our 8.6 million average weekday customers,"" MTA Chairman Thomas F. Prendergast said in a press release. ""While some schedules and routes may change, we are ready to get everyone where they need to go during this special time.""
Certain entrances, exits and stairways in Penn Station will be closed for security reasons. Be prepared for it to be extra crowded when leaving Penn Station. MTA Police and additional LIRR staff will be in Penn Station to help any commuters who need assistance.
These entrances will remain open:
Only those who have tickets are permitted to go the Pope's events. Everyone else should avoid the areas the Pope is visiting, as road closures will cause plenty of traffic.
The MTA suggests commuters to consider traveling to/from Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and to then transfer to the 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q and R subway lines.
Travelers should check Pope Francis' New York Itinerary, news and traffic reports. Commuters can find more information about transit conditions by signing up for LIRR alerts.

The findings analyzed data on the ideologies of each governor currently serving. Cuomo came in fifth behind Tom Wolf (D-PA), Jay Inslee (D-WA), Mark Dayton (D-MN), and Peter Schulman (D-VT).
Cuomo's public statements, press releases, and other information were analyzed on popular and important political issues. The study found he was most liberal when it came to individual rights, moderately liberal on domestic and economic issues, and moderately conservative on defense and international issues.
For example, Cuomo was deemed ""very liberal"" when it comes to individual rights, according to his stance on legally requiring the hiring of women and minorities, comfort with same-sex marriage, and support for easing the voter registration process.
On the other hand, Cuomo is ""moderately conservative"" on defense and international issues, considering his strong support for the expansion of free trade, support of ""American exceptionalism,"" and his wish to avoid foreign entanglements.

How dependent is New York on the federal government compared to other states?
It's somewhere in the middle, according to a new study.
WalletHub conducted a study to answer that question across the county. It used four factors to come up with a ranking of all 50 states:
New York came in at No. 20, with No. 1 being the least dependent and No. 50 being the most, right behind Washington and just ahead of Rhode Island.
You can see the full results in the map below:

The five least-dependent states were New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota and Kansas. The most dependent were Montana, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and New Mexico.
There was one area where New York stands out: federal funding. Federal funding accounts for 43.39 percent of state revenue, which is more than any other state except Vermont.
One irony pointed out by WalletHub was the discrepancy in how states voted vs. how reliant they were on the federal government.
States that voted Republican in the 2012 election, whose party preaches less dependance on the government, had an average rank of 33.2. States that tend to vote Democrat had an average rank of 18.3.

Not only did Norpoth correctly predict Trump's win over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but he has correctly called five of the past six presidential elections using his ""primary model,"" a statistical representation of U.S. presidential races based on data going back more than a century, according to the university.
According to Norpoth, Trump has a 91 percent chance of winning re-election. The model also has Trump securing 362 electoral votes. His prediction runs contrary to most polls — similar to 2016.
When applied to previous elections, Norpoth's primary model was accurate 25 of 27 times; missing only Al Gore's defeat to George W. Bush and Richard Nixon's loss to John F. Kennedy.
Norpoth put his model to the test for the first time in 1996 after having started working on it post-1992 election.
""My first forecast was the 1996 election, the one where Bill Clinton was re-elected for a second term,"" he said in a news release. ""Predicting a Clinton win was considered a stretch at the time because he was pretty bad in his first term.""
Norpoth continues to evolve his model. The key metric the professor used, even in its early stages, is the results of presidential primaries. The focus on those primaries is the difference between his model and others, he said.
""It's all about primary elections, which are real electoral contests and the votes are counted and tabulated,"" he said. ""I also use real numbers, such as the results of previous elections, which indicate whether the pendulum is swinging away from or toward the White House party. This is something that also relies on real election results and not any kind of an opinion poll.""
Norpoth does not take approval ratings into account under his model, saying that it's a poll number, which he doesn't use. The primary performance of a sitting president is a proxy for that, he added.
Norpoth wasn't surprised his model predicted a landslide win for Trump.
""When I looked at New Hampshire and I saw that Donald Trump got 85 percent of the votes, and the closest challenger was Bill Weld at 10 percent, I was pretty sure what the model was going to predict,"" he said. ""If Trump had gotten only 55 percent and an opponent had gotten 40 percent, I may not have predicted that Donald Trump would have a chance to win. Maybe. It would depend on the other side as well.""
On the other side of the aisle, Norpoth believes the high amount of Democratic Party candidates, and the ""inability"" of one of them to get off the launchpad may have ""doomed the party from the start.""
""People have forgotten how Joe Biden did in New Hampshire,"" Norpoth said. ""He was terrible. He got 8.4 percent of the vote, which is unbelievable for a candidate with any aspirations of being president.""
The professor said his model is simply math.
""Everybody thinks Trump is going to go down in flames, and here I am predicting with almost total certainty that he's going to win,"" he said. ""It seems crazy. But it's not."""

23,/new-york/threevillage/englebright-down-ross-ahead-absentee-ballot-counting,2020-11-04T20:29:42Z,Englebright Down To Ross Ahead Of Absentee...,0,4,Michael DeSantis,Patch Staff,"SUFFOLK COUNTY, NY — Republican Michael Ross is holding a slight lead over 28-year Democrat incumbent Steven Englebright in the race for New York state's 4th Assembly District following Election Day on Tuesday, according to numbers on the Suffolk County Board of Elections website.
Ross has 22,966 votes to Englebright's 20,999, which translates to a more than 4 percentage point lead. However, absentee ballots are yet to be counted. Libertarian Adam Fischer-Gledhill picked up 296 votes.
Ross told Patch he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the election results.
""I think that, judging from the other races, the voters of Suffolk County have spoken,"" he said. ""They are tired of the Albany agenda, and they want their politicians to hear their voices. If I win, I promise I will listen.""
Englebright did not immediately respond to Patch's request for comment.
The votes tallied Tuesday included all early votes and ballots cast on Election Day but did not include absentee ballots received so far, said Peter McGreevy, Southold Republican Committee Chair.
There are 15,046 absentee ballots received from 4th Assembly District constituents, according to the Suffolk BOE. Of those, 7,821 are Democrat, 2,948 are Republican, 181 are Conservative, 530 are Independent, and 3,501 are blank.
The board expects to start counting absentee ballots next Tuesday — after it has had the opportunity to remove the absentee ballots of those voters who also cast a ballot on a machine and compare the signatures, as well as have bipartisan teams compare the signatures on the oath envelopes to the voter's signatures on file.
The 4th Assembly District covers Setauket, Stony Brook, Port Jefferson, Port Jefferson Station, Terryville, Old Field Village, Poquott Village and Belle Terre Village, as well as parts of Selden, Coram and Gordon Heights.
Englebright was first elected to the New York state Assembly in 1992."

27,/new-york/threevillage/meet-candidates-nancy-goroff-congress,2020-10-23T17:24:03Z,Meet The Candidates: Nancy Goroff For Congress,0,16,Lisa Finn,Patch Staff,"This November, Long Island residents will be hitting the polls to exercise their right to vote. While voters will be electing the president on Election Day, November 3, they will also be choosing their local representatives. In New York, state and federal races will also be on the ballot.
Democrat Nancy Goroff is seeking to unseat incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin for his 1st Congressional District seat.
The 1st Congressional District includes most of central and eastern Suffolk County, including the East End, Brookhaven Town, and most of Smithtown. View the district map here.
Goroff, 52, of Stony Brook is married to her husband Chris and has two grown children, Grace and Anz. She has an BS from Harvard University and a PhD in chemistry from UCLA. She is a scientist, has been a professor of chemistry at Stony Brook University for 23 years since 1997, served as Associate Provost from 2014 to 2016 and was chair of the chemistry department from 2017 to 2019.
In anticipation of the election, Patch asked candidates in the contested races to answer questions about their campaigns and will be publishing candidate profiles as Election Day draws near.
Check out the full Q&A below:
Nancy Goroff
Why are you seeking elective office?
Suffolk County deserves a representative who will trust science and use facts and evidence to tackle the serious problems our community faces, like combating the deadly pandemic, lowering prescription drug costs, protecting healthcare coverage for those with preexisting conditions, and addressing climate change.
The single most pressing issue facing our nation/state/community is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
There is nothing more important than fixing the public health crisis we are in. Here in Suffolk County, we've lost over 2,000 lives to COVID-19, all because President Trump ignored scientists and experts, and put his political agenda before our safety.
In Congress, I will follow the science, trust public health experts, and push for federal resources and an organized national response to the pandemic, including testing, treatment, and PPE.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidate seeking this post?
Lee Zeldin said that Trump's handling of the pandemic in New York was ""phenomenal"". I believe the President has been reckless and incompetent.
Lee Zeldin has voted to take away Americans' healthcare by repealing the ACA, without any plan for what should replace it. I believe we need to protect the ACA and lower prescription drug prices.
Lee Zeldin has voted countless times against women's reproductive rights. I believe a woman's choice and the decisions she makes about her health are between her and her doctor.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the community (or district or constituency)
Lee Zeldin has failed on so many issues for Long Island. He stands on the wrong side of the fight against climate change and coastal erosion. He voted against restoring the SALT tax deduction, which would directly help the people of this district. He has pandered to the president at every opportunity while not holding town halls or listening to constituents. Lee Zeldin could not be more out of step with the community.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
We must address the deadly pandemic with federal resources for state and local governments, protect the ACA and health coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, lower the cost of prescription drug prices, and set aggressive targets to combat climate change and solve our climate crisis.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I raised my two daughters in Suffolk County and have taught chemistry at Stony Brook University for 23 years. When my kids were in high school I found myself a single mom, working full-time, and having to make sure that I was there for my children, no matter what. As the chair of the chemistry department I led a department with more than 300 people. I had to make tough decisions, and then be ready to defend those decisions to the people who cared about them. In Congress, I will use my experience to listen to all stakeholders, develop real-life solutions, and build consensus to get those solutions put into action.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Being a good leader means being a good listener. Ask lots of questions and try to learn something from each person you meet."
