Lezlye Zupkus Unanimously Endorsed,0,0,Press Release Desk,News Partner,"Press release from the Office of State Rep. Lezlye Zupkus: Through a cheerful video nominating convention, State Representative Lezlye Zupkus was unanimously endorsed Tuesday night by delegates of the 89th Assembly District, which includes Bethany, Prospect and a portion of Cheshire.
In her acceptance speech, Zupkus pledged to help rebuild Connecticut back after the pandemic.

""The past few months have been unprecedented to say the least. As an elected official, it is my duty to keep the public as informed as possible, especially during a time like this. I have worked to do this through my email blasts, social media and mailings. We are in this together, and together we will get through this.""

When the legislature re-convenes for special session, we will need to help those working families who are struggling so mightily. And also make small businesses a priority because businesses that stay provide job opportunities.

Prospect resident Marie Delage provided her nominating speech in support of Lezlye during the 89thAssembly District convention.

In her speech, Lezlye also thanked the delegates for their trust and support, it is my honor to accept this nomination to continue to lead the residents of Bethany, Prospect and Cheshire residing in the 89th Assembly District.

During Lezlye's last term as state representative she helped stop a legislative proposal to force school districts to regionalize and halted a state budget proposal to shift the teacher pension costs to our local communities.

Zupkus has also been a voice in the fight against tolls, both a trucks-only, and all vehicle toll proposal and also fought a plan to raid out special transportation fund lock box. The fund was raided by $171 million by the governor last year.

Lezlye also opposed the 2019-2020 state budget that would have raised taxes on working families by $1.7 billion.
Zupkus is the Deputy Leader at large for the House Republicans

Lezlye wrapped up her speech saying she will continue to fight for a Connecticut where people can afford to live, businesses can thrive and our kids have the choice to raiser their families here.

Logan, Zupkus Talk Tolls and State Finances at Office Hour
BETHANY – State Senator George Logan (R-17) and State Representative Lezlye Zupkus (R-89) met with Bethany taxpayers at Clark Memorial Library on Jan. 8 to talk about the upcoming legislative session that starts on February 5th.
""I want to thank all the residents that came out to express their concerns and share their ideas about how we can better move our state forward,"" said Rep. Zupkus. ""Our state faces difficult fiscal problems and we need to address how we are spending our money in Connecticut. The legislature needs learn to say 'no' to extravagant state union contracts and wasteful state spending that leave taxpayers holding the bag. We don't need tolls or to raise taxes to fund our state government.""
Sen. Logan said, ""At meetings like this, we let Bethany taxpayers know that we are doing everything we can at the State Capitol to protect their wallets. Rep. Zupkus and I will not stop fighting On behalf of you, the taxpayers. We work for you. We're listening. It's an honor to be Bethany's voices in Hartford. Please feel free to contact us on any issue.""
The topics of discussion included tolls, state pension and benefit costs and the state's fiscal issues.
Recently, Comptroller Kevin Lembo announced that the state is headed to end the year with a $28 million budget deficit. The state budget that was passed this year was crafted by Governor Ned Lamont and legislative Democrats without input from Republican lawmakers.
In addition, Governor Lamont met with legislative Democrats this week to encourage them to call a special session to pass truck-only tolls.
Both Logan and Zupkus have been vocal opponents of tolls and believe truck-only tolls will just be the beginning and will lead to tolls on both cars and trucks, taking more money out of the pockets of Bethany taxpayers.

Lezlye Zupkus and State Senator George Logan held a Town Hall Meeting in Bethany last week to provide residents with a post-session recap about the 2019 legislative session, the state budget and the debate on how to fund our state transportation projects without tolls.
Sen. Logan and Rep. Zupkus spoke to approximately twenty Bethany residents at the Town Hall.
Both Sen. Logan and Rep. Zupkus talked about how they opposed the state budget due to its many taxes, almost $2 Billion and a refusal to have a debate on how to reduce our state spending.
Both legislators declared their opposition to any toll plan and mentioned how a toll proposal did not have enough support in the General Assembly at this time. The Bethany lawmakers prefer to finance our state transportation projects using the 'Prioritize Progress' plan which have the Department of Transportation list the projects by importance and we would bond the money while still keeping the state under its mandated bonding cap.
Some of the positive pieces of legislation passed in 2019 were bills to address the growing opioid crisis, a new law to get tougher on those who sell or manufacture Fentanyl.
""I was very frustrated with the tone the legislature took after the majority party gained seats this past year. Many pieces of legislation ended up being harmful to small business and middle class families,"" said Rep. Zupkus. ""I was grateful we were able to stop the forced regionalization of school districts and keep Amity School District intact. We need to let successful and volunteer regionalization occur and not force local communities into different districts that do not fit the needs of the students.""
""At the State Capitol, Rep. Zupkus and I continue to fight to protect Bethany taxpayers' wallets,""Sen. Logan said. ""Events like these allow us to keep Bethany taxpayers informed on a wide variety of topics. We very much appreciate how Bethany residents are staying active and vocal regarding key issues like tolls, tax hikes, forced regionalization of school districts and the state budget. Rep. Zupkus and I will not stop pushing to make Connecticut a more affordable state, and we thank Bethany taxpayers for their support.""
The lawmakers handed out the 2019 Major Public Acts report, which provides brief descriptions on a number of issues including legislation on opioid drugs, transportation and the state's business climate, among others. Residents can read the full document by visiting 2019 Major Acts. Residents who were unable to attend and would like to contact Rep. Zupkus and Sen.

Former-Country Club Property Constructability Review
Deciding the future of the former-Country Club property is a key component of our Town's continued fiscal health. Working closely with the Board of Selectmen, I am pleased that our efforts to address this issue have resulted in two significant proposals from reputable developers for over-55 housing on an area roughly one-third of the parcel. I expect the Board of Selectmen will choose one of the proposals to send to townspeople for a Special Town Meeting and a referendum, as I believe is our responsibility to do. Again, the voters will decide.
At our February Board meeting, we received the first draft of the Constructability Review that we requested from the Town's engineering firm. This document is available for review on the Current Issues and Projects page at Town website.
The Board will take time to review this document and we will schedule a discussion for our March BOS meeting to get any questions answered that we may have. I ask that residents continue to bear with us as we bring this process to a conclusion in the immediate future. I encourage everyone to attend future meetings and share their opinion during public comment. By hearing all voices in our community, I am confident townspeople will become sufficiently informed to make the decisions necessary to ensure our Town's continued fiscal health."

Proposals for the Former-Country Club Property
Since I began my term in office as First Selectman in July 2017, among my top priorities has been to work diligently, together with my fellow members of the Board of Selectmen, to explore and bring to the residents of Woodbridge a viable plan for the future of the former- Country Club property.
As you know, this approximately 150-acre parcel was purchased by the Town in 2009 and has been the focus of considerable efforts over the years to determine the best path forward. I authorized a Public Opinion Survey in January-February 2018 to ask residents to provide their thoughts, and this information has been helpful as the Board of Selectmen evaluate various options.
With this in mind, the Board of Selectmen is considering proposals for the best use of the property and at a Special BOS Meeting on November 28th, the Board heard presentations from two developers who are interested in purchasing part of the parcel for development of Senior Housing (over 55 years of age).
One option was from Insite Development and Woodbridge resident Brian St. Pierre, and the other proposal was from the developer of Fieldstone Village on Rt. 34 in Orange, Robert Sachs.
After the two presentations, questions from the Board were answered by the developers. The Board then moved into Executive Session to discuss negotiations regarding these offers. We will continue negotiations with a goal of having further details available to the public prior to a Public Information Session where the public may see each option presented and have the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers.
Public Information Session
Monday, December 17, 2018 at 7:00 pm in The Center Gym
Immediately upon the conclusion of the December 17th Public Information Session, we will hold a Special Board of Selectmen meeting so the Selectmen can decide whether to set a date for a Special Town Meeting and Referendum on one of the options. As I have stated several times before, any proposal for the sale of former- Country Club property will ultimately be decided by you, the voters.
All the presentation material shown at the November 28th meeting is now available at the Town Website.
Please visit our Current Issues & Projects Page to review this material.
I will continue to keep the public informed of next steps. If we decide to proceed to a Special Town Meeting and Referendum, please be advised that a written notice will be mailed to every household. As always, please be in touch if you would like to share your thoughts with me!"

It is alleged that, on numerous occasions, Okwuosa and My Father My Son billed Medicaid for behavioral health services as if a licensed individual had provided the services when in fact an unlicensed individual rendered the services.
To resolve the allegations under the federal and state False Claims Acts, Okwuosa and My Father My Son paid $230,000 in order to reimburse the Medicaid program for conduct occurring from March 1, 2017 to May 5, 2018.
Under the False Claims Act, the government can recover up to three times its actual damages, plus penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim. This case stems from a larger investigation into fraudulent activity in the area of behavioral health services, which has been jointly conducted by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Chief State's Attorney's Office and the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General, with support from the Connecticut Department of Social Services.
This case was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Thidemann, and Assistant Attorney General Joshua L. Jackson of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. This matter is announced in coordination with a Department of Justice nationwide enforcement action involving more than 300 defendants in criminal and civil cases across 51 federal districts. The defendants, including more than 100 doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, are alleged to have submitted more than $6 billion in false and fraudulent claims to federal health care programs and private insurers.
People who suspect health care fraud are encouraged to report it by calling 1-800-HHS-TIPS or the Health Care Fraud Task Force at (203) 777-6311.

For immediate release
August 8, 2020
My name is EJ Maher and I am your Democratic candidate for CT State Representative for the 89th District; Bethany, Cheshire and Prospect. I want to introduce myself and ask for your support. Please reach out to me at ejforthe89th@gmail.com to share your hopes for the future of our communities and our state. Please also follow me on fb, ig and twitter as ejforthe89th. Finally, I need your help! Please click this link, https://www.secure.anedot.com/ejforthe89th/donate to help me qualify for the CT Citizens Election Program grant…
I am a 40 year old lifetime Connecticut resident. I grew up in Stratford, went to high school in Milford and have lived in many of the surrounding towns since graduating from New York University in 2004. I have been married to my beautiful wife Sandy for 13 years and we have lived in Bethany since 2013 with three incredible young ladies we are proud to call our daughters. I have been a firefighter for the City of Norwalk for over 10 years. Prior to that I was the production controller for an aerospace manufacturer in New Haven. I have further professional experience in construction, project/retail management, food service, public service, education and marketing.
I formerly sat on the Cable Television Advisory Council for the City of New Haven and I am a former Vice-President of the New Haven Chapter of the CT Young Democrats. I am currently serving in my elected position as a member of the Bethany Community School Board of Education. I also serve as Bethany's representative to the ACES Regional Governing Board.
I have always striven to be of service to my community. Running for State Representative of the 89th district is an opportunity to expand the reach of that service. To be able to serve the communities of Bethany, Cheshire and Prospect at the state level will be a privilege that I will not take for granted.
The covid-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic have further cemented my resolve to ensure that healthcare is within reach of every single resident of our community and in the State of Connecticut.
The education of our children needs to be equitable and rigorous for all students, regardless of where they live or what personal obstacles they may have to overcome in order to learn and thrive. I further believe that our vocational preparation is failing to reach the students that need it the most. We need a pipeline to trade apprenticeship for non-college bound young people and vocational training should be accessible to any of CT's residents.
We need strong unions with easy and protected access to union representation for all workers.
We must guarantee that a full week of work will provide the income necessary to support a family. I will fight to ensure all workers are treated equally and alike and that we all receive a living wage for our honest time and labor. We must ensure businesses pay their fair share of taxes and we should also examine the tax-exempt entities in this state to ensure compliance with current law while reexamining those laws to ensure the spirit and intent of tax exemption is not being misapplied.
Investing now in our state's infrastructure; our roads, bridges, parks, beaches, historical buildings and tourist attractions can provide good paying jobs now to those who need them most while recovering from the losses caused by measures taken to slow the spread of the covid-19 virus.
Our residents and our businesses large and small will need support to recover from the covid-19 pandemic, I will work to make sure state resources are distributed fairly and not misemployed.
I believe we can protect our state's resident's 2nd amendment rights while doing more to keep guns out of the hands of those who would seek to do harm with them.
Finally, I believe indisputably that black lives do matter. I steadfastly and unequivocally support our public safety officers and the good work they do every day, often without thanks, but we can no longer tolerate the undeniably disproportionate impact of law enforcement on communities and citizens of color. The recent special legislative session judiciously took up the important work of moving the practice of policing in our state to a system that serves its mandate and protects all of CTs residents. That work is not done. We must forge a lasting relationship between police and the communities they serve. Together we can effect meaningful and immediate change toward fair and effective policing built for the 21st century. That bridge won't be built overnight but it is imperative that we move to repair the fractured relationship that exists today so we can all move forward and thrive, together.
We have so much good work to do in Hartford in the coming months and years. We must meaningfully engage the groups and communities that we will be working for (including Black, Latinx, Women, LGBTQ+ and those living in poverty) to identify short and long term goals and to immediately implement the best strategies and plans to meaningfully and quantifiably move toward a better future for all of Connecticut's residents. From the moment the next class of legislators are sworn in next year I will be working hard to bring equality to all Connecticut residents and to ensure that no one is held down again while they are begging to breathe. We cannot elect leaders anymore who show up and list the reasons why we cannot do all of these things. We must show up to fight for progress that has heretofore stalled- no more excuses. We are…
Better. Together.
EJ Maher

William S. Palmieri, 56, of Bethany, was sentenced Monday to three years of probation and must serve the first six months in home confinement, U.S. States Attorney for Connecticut John H. Durham announced.
Palmieri, an attorney with a practice specializing in civil rights law, was also ordered to perform 150 hours of community service. He is required to pay $141,474.53 in back taxes, and $86,234.47 in interest and penalties, totaling $227,709, according to authorities.
""Between 2006 and 2014, Palmieri reported to the IRS, but did not pay, all the income taxes he owed, even though he had the ability to make substantially greater tax payments during that time,"" officials wrote in a news release. ""The investigation also revealed that Palmieri used his attorney IOLTA bank account to pay various personal expenses, including his home mortgage and private school tuition payments.""
Palmieri pleaded guilty last December to two counts of willful failure to pay income taxes."
