Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley met with marijuana policy experts in Denver Thursday to hear about how legalizing the drug has affected communities in Colorado, but he isn't yet ready to endorse federal legislation legalizing recreational use of pot.
Among the issues the Democratic presidential candidate has touted as he has campaigned around the country is his move while governor to decriminalize marijuana.
But he is being cautious about the next step on the federal level.
""I think we still have to watch, and we have to learn in Colorado and Washington state,"" the ex-governor told reporters after the meeting, according to The Denver Post. ""I'm not there yet, but I am watching very closely what's happening.""
Throughout the 90-minute Denver meeting, lawmakers, administrators, business owners, police officers and veterans detailed positive impacts of the state's legalization experiment.
""Colorado's economy is doing well, it's going up,"" State Rep. Jonathan Singer told O'Malley. ""Teen use has either stayed stagnant or gone down and we're seeing our law enforcement able to focus on crimes that hurt people.""
After listening to several speakers, O'Malley addressed the group, stressing the importance of learning from the states that have legalized marijuana.
""I think as Americans, given the hard truths about drug overdose, violent crime and incarceration, we should have this conversation and be informed by true facts and experiences that people of Colorado are having on the ground here,"" O'Malley said.
The meeting was hosted by Vicente Sederberg LLC, a Denver-based marijuana law firm. Managing partner Brian Vicente said he appreciated O'Malley taking the time to hear from Colorado's leading minds on marijuana policy.
""It showed that he's a thoughtful candidate and he is in touch with the issues that are really hot topics in our country right now,"" Vicente said. ""It speaks volumes that he came to Colorado and sat down with experts to hear about how it's going here and educate his viewpoint.""
Vicente wrote Colorado's constitutional amendment that legalized recreational use of marijuana.
As part of his criminal justice reform proposal, O'Malley has said he will move to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug, alongside Heroin and LSD, to a Schedule II drug. The reclassification is largely a symbolic move, said Vincente, who advocated for full declassification, but it will help make it easier to conduct research on marijuana. On the campaign trail,
O'Malley has highlighted his marijuana policy record in Maryland. He signed a bill in 2014 decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, making Maryland the 18th state to do so. He also made Maryland the 21st state with a medical marijuana program, allowing the state to issue licenses to growers and dispensaries and for patients to possess up to a 30-day supply.
While O'Malley oversaw the loosening of Maryland's cannabis laws, some activists worry about his previous opposition to marijuana reform and his inactive role in his own state's policy changes.
""He presided over [decriminalization and medical marijuana] but he is certainly not viewed as championing that legislation,"" Vincente said. ""He's simply not.""

The Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), a legalization advocacy group who had a spokesperson present at O'Malley's meeting, has graded each 2016 presidential candidate on marijuana policy.
O'Malley received a C-minus, the lowest grade of any declared Democratic candidate.
""He has always been steadfastly an opponent of marijuana policy reform as governor, although it is certainly a welcome development his change in approaches more recently,"" said Dan Riffle, MPP's federal policy director who focused on the Maryland region between 2009 and 2012, during part of O'Malley's time in office.
Riffle said it is not important that candidates support federal legalization, but rather that they respect states' rights to legalize marijuana.
""What I would like to see from O'Malley and other candidates is a pledge to work to change federal law so that not only are we not enforcing federal law in states like Colorado but we're actually changing federal law so that people who are in compliance of state law in Colorado aren't violating federal law,"" Riffle said.
Marijuana business owners at Thursday's listening session said because of federal drug enforcement, banks refuse to deal with marijuana-related companies, forcing the businesses to operate exclusively with cash.
The issue of a state's rights to decide its own marijuana laws came up inWednesday night's Republican debate, with libertarian-leaning Rand Paul arguing against federal government interference.
""I would let Colorado do what the Tenth Amendment says,"" said the Kentucky senator, who received MPP's highest grade of any candidate, with an A-minus. ""This power, we were never intended to have crime dealing at the federal level, crime was supposed to be left to the states. Colorado has made their decision."""

Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is criticizing the Democratic National Committee's plan to host six primary debates for the 2016 presidential primary, noting the party held 16 debates in 2008 and 13 debates in the 2004 election cycle.
The national committee also issued a threat to candidates who accept any unsanctioned debate invitation or forum, according to news outlets.
Each of the early primary states – Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada – will host a single debate, according to the official schedule. Two other debates will be held in February or March in Florida or Wisconsin.
On Twitter O'Malley said: ""The number of presidential debates should be dictated by voters—not @TheDemocrats in Washington. #WeNeedDebate""
On Wednesday O'Malley also tweeted on the subject: ""@TheDemocrats think they can limit the number of debates we're going to have before the Iowa caucuses…We need to have not just one debate, not just two, but many. Because they will shape the future of the country we give our kids.""
On a conference call, O'Malley for President New Hampshire State Director John Bivona said voters like him in the Granite State are ""swayed by big ideas"" and candidates that actually go out and meet first-in-the-nation primary voters in intimate settings, as has historically been done for generations.
""It's simply wrong,"" he said. ""(The DNC) debate plan should be viewed as a non-starter. It's DC bigfooting at its worse. The DNC should have no role in this process. Candidates should be able to participate without retribution.""
The retribution comments came after The Daily Beast noted in a story earlier this week that Democratic candidates that strayed from the rules would be punished, according to DNC officials.
Bernie Sanders, another Democratic presidential candidate, said he was ""disappointed, but not surprised,"" by the DNC's six debate limit.
""At a time when many Americans are demoralized about politics and have given up on the political process, I think it's imperative that we have as many debates as possible – certainly more than six,"" he said. ""I look forward to working with the DNC to see if we can significantly expand the proposed debate schedule.""
According to NECN, here are the locations and dates of the six debates:"

The state allowed the Maryland Sons of Confederate Veterans to release a Confederate flag license plate in 1996 and after ""numerous, substantial complaints... about the apparent negative racial connotations of the logo design,"" the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration went to court in 1997 to try to recall the plates, according to court filings. The judge determined that the design was protected under the First Amendment.
On Friday, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh asked federal authorities to override the injunction from the 1997 court case so Maryland could recall the plates, USA Today reported.
Lawmakers in Maryland have been pushing for the recall of the plate after Dylann Roof killed nine African-American churchgoers last month during a Bible study in a church in Charleston, S.C. Images widely distributed of Roof show him holding a Confederate flag, and he has reportedly told authorities he was attempting to start a race war.

The request by Maryland's attorney general to allow the state to recall the plates comes after the Supreme Court ruled in June that Texas could deny a request for a Confederate flag design on license plates because the objects contain ""government speech,"" outside the traditional context of the First Amendment as it pertains to individuals.
There are 178 vehicles, including 27 motorcycles, that have the Confederate flag plate in Maryland, according to WMDT.
The Confederate flag plate was no longer available Friday through the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, and WMDT reports that the administration under Gov. Larry Hogan has suspended its production."

__________________
The U.S. Supreme Court announced Thursday that it has sided with the Obama administration over its major healthcare overhaul, upholding federal subsidies across the country.
In a 6-3 ruling, the nation's highest court ruled that critics' reading of Obamacare might make sense in isolation, but not when viewed in a larger context and in light of the intention of the law, according to ABC News.
It's the second time the high court, ABC News points out, and Chief Justice John Roberts — has backed controversial portions of Obamacare. The first ruling was in 2012. Read a transcript of the March 4 oral argument here.
Congressman Chris Van Hollen released the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in King v. Burwell ruling that individuals who get their health insurance through exchanges established by the federal government will remain eligible for tax subsidies:
""The Supreme Court today, for the second time, affirmed the legality of the Affordable Care Act in a decision that assures the law will continue to improve the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans. Republicans in Congress must now give up their ludicrous crusade to delegitimize and dismantle this lifesaving law which, as the Congressional Budget Office indicated last week, also puts America on a more sustainable fiscal path. The Affordable Care Act has truly empowered families and changed health care in our country for the better.""
Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said the law's subsidies are to be made available to every consumer, whether they get their health care through the federal marketplace or through state-based marketplaces.
He added, ""The Affordable Care Act is working, helping millions access quality, affordable coverage and slowing the growth in health care spending to its lowest rate in half a century. Republicans in Congress should think twice before holding further votes, beyond the 60 they already have held, to undo the critical patient protections and cost savings the Affordable Care Act provides.""
U.S. Senator Ben Cardin also applauded the ruling, saying that users of the system can exhale in relief. He added:
""Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer discriminate against sick people, women can't be charged more for their health care, and young adults getting their start in the world can stay on their parents' health plans. Health care costs are being reined in, and millions of Americans finally have gained security and stability through affordable health coverage. More than 80 percent of Americans who purchased their health care coverage through one of the health exchanges is satisfied with their health insurance.""
Rep. Elijah E. Cummings also weighed in: ""It's time for Republicans to stop attacking this incredibly successful law—which will save hundreds of billions of dollars in the next ten years—and focus on ensuring that every American has access to the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.""
Congresswoman Donna F. Edwards (MD-4) said the court correctly interpreted Congress' aim to make health insurance affordable for millions of Americans.
""With the Supreme Court once again upholding the legitimacy of the ACA, it is long overdue that we stop wasting time and resources fighting these old political battles. We must work together and focus on addressing the challenges ahead, including long-term transportation funding, ensuring college affordability and reducing student debt, and providing quality, affordable child care.""
Congressman John Sarbanes also cheered the court's decision: ""Despite more than 60 attempts by Republicans to repeal the ACA and two Supreme Court challenges, it's been proven over and over again that this law is constitutional and that it's working. After today's decision, all Americans – regardless of where they live – will continue to have access to premium tax credits so that they can get the high-quality, affordable health care they deserve."""

The government watchdog group said it filed the voter lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Maryland's districts, arguing that their design in 2011 pushed 27 percent of the state's voters into new districts.
Plaintiffs in the new lawsuit include Maryland Delegates Neil C. Parrott and Matt Morgan, and former Maryland legislator and gubernatorial candidate Ambassador Ellen Sauerbrey.
The lawsuit Parrott, et al, v. Lamone, et al says the congressional districting plan signed into law by then-Gov. Martin O'Malley in October 2011 greatly reconfigured Maryland's congressional districts. In total, 27 percent of all Marylanders were placed in a different congressional district.
The lawsuit cites the 6th Congressional District in western Maryland as an example of the intent to manipulate districts to help political candidates. The redistricting process added part of Democrat-heavy Montgomery County to what had been a Republican stronghold in western Maryland, WTOP reports, to target 10-term Republican Roscoe Bartlett. He lost the 2012 election to Democrat John Delaney.
Maryland's gerrymander produces ""split counties, county fragments, and split precincts,"" resulting in the arbitrary political fragmentation of the state, the group says, which harms Republicans, Democrats, and independent voters.
Critics of the district maps claim the districts were designed to enhance the power of select incumbents while minimizing the voting power of minorities, rural voters and Republicans.
""In Maryland, politicians pick their voters, which is unconstitutional,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. ""Maryland's gerrymandered congressional district map is a national embarrassment and harms both Democrat and Republican voters. The courts should require Maryland to go back and draw district maps that respect Maryland voters and don't make a mockery of commonsense and the rule of law."""

""The Confederate is flag divisive and offensive, and should not be allowed as a symbol on Maryland license plates,"" Mayor Rawlings-Blake said on Twitter.
The flag has been controversial for decades as a symbol adopted by white supremacists.
It has come under increasing scrutiny in the last week after Dylann Roof killed nine African-American churchgoers during a bible study in a historic Charleston, S.C. church. Images widely distributed of Roof show him holding a Confederate flag, and he has reportedly told authorities he was attempting to start a race war.
Similarly, Confederate-themed monuments are being questioned in the region, with Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz seeking to rename Robert E. Lee Park, which honors the Confederate general.
Kamenetz told The Baltimore Sun that county officials have for months discussed a new name for the park that reflects the area's diverse population.
""We believe Lake Roland Park is more reflective of this open-space treasure, and we are confident that the city will approve our request,"" Kamenetz said.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week that Texas can refuse a license plate request from the Sons of Confederate Veterans. The court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the specialty license plate constitutes government speech, and Texas is entitled to reject a plate with the Confederate battle flag on it.
Neighboring Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Tuesday he plans to replace a specialty license plate for members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans because the current plate prominently features the Confederate battle flag.
On Monday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and other prominent Palmetto State officials announced they would begin the process of removing a Confederate flag that currently flies in a high-profile spot in front of the statehouse.

Gov. Larry Hogan has been diagnosed with cancer. The reform-minded Republican who surprised politicos nationwide with his win in deep-blue Maryland in November announced the diagnosis Monday afternoon, noting he was exactly five months into his term — and not going anywhere.
Hogan was diagnosed less than two weeks ago with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. The governor delivered the news with the same balance of candor and charming levity that he has used to tackle partisan realities in the Statehouse.
""This cancer is very advanced and very aggressive,"" Hogan said, while noting there was a strong chance of success.
""The odds of beating this are much, much better than my odds of beating Anthony Brown,"" Hogan said, referring to his Democratic opponent in the 2014 general election.
Hogan described the cancer as ""very advanced stage 3 or stage 4"" and referred to cancerous tumors located in various parts of his body, including a tumor in his back.
The governor said he will be undergoing aggressive chemotherapy treatment over the next 18 weeks, including a four-day stay in the hospital.
Hogan told the press during his announcement that he'll continue to perform his duties as governor when not in treatment.
Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford and Hogan's cabinet leaders will be stepping up to assist with his duties, Hogan said."

Less than a week after the controversial announcement of his presidential candidacy, Donald Trump will attend the Maryland Republican Party's 25th annual Red, White and Blue Dinner — the organization's largest fundraiser of the year.
The dinner will be held on Tuesday, June 23, at the BWI Airport Marriott on West Nursery Road in Linthicum, Maryland, and will begin at 7 p.m.
It's not uncommon for some of the biggest players in the party to attend the event, but Trump's appearance will bring added attention to the fundraiser, and perhaps not for the best of reasons.
On Tuesday, exactly one week in advance of the Maryland fundraiser, Trump announced his GOP candidacy in the 2016 presidential election, and made some controversial statements in doing so.
Among his comments were what some critics deemed his insensitive quips regarding the United States' foreign relations, Obamacare and more.
""When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity,"" Trump said of the U.S.'s relationship with Mexico. ""And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically. The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. … They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.
""... It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably — probably — from the Middle East. But we don't know.""
Trump went on to suggest the U.S. build a ""great wall"" (alluding to the Great Wall of China) along the U.S.-Mexico border, and even vowed to have Mexico pay for it.
But he wasn't finished. He went on to question the intelligence of American leaders in comparison to Chinese leaders, stating:
""Take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.""
He then went on to praise his own wealth:
""I'm really rich. I'll show you in a second,"" he said as he revealed his net worth of $8.7 billion. ""I don't have to brag but that's the kind of thinking our country needs. ... We got to make the country rich.""
He then went on to claim ""we have losers"" leading the United States."

The Social Security Administration has gone digital.
The SSA recently launched a digital registration database it says will protect the identities of legitimate Social Security recipients from identity thieves hoping to poach their benefits.
According to the SSA, the online registration database allows Marylanders who are still working but contributing to Social Security to keep track of their earnings, verify their earnings and even get an estimate on their future benefits.
Maryland residents currently receiving Social Security checks can get a letter with proof of benefits, enable direct deposit, get replacement Medicare cards, and more.
But what makes the online registration database a true blessing is its advanced security measures. The system prevents anyone who may have acquired your Social Security number from stealing your identity to receive your benefits, thanks to additional financial questions you'll have to answer when you register in the database. Those questions are relevant to your financial history, and are questions only you would be able to answer.
You can even set your account to make you enter the exact amount of Social Security money you receive each month as a second password, furthering your security measures.
The SSA is also alerting citizens to ""phishing"" attacks made by identity thieves who pretend to be the administration in order to trick you into giving them your personal information. The SSA says it will only ever send e-mails from a .government address and links in said e-mails will only ever go to .gov websites.

Martin O'Malley revealed on Snapchat Tuesday that he will be making a big announcement May 30 on Federal Hill.
Since concluding his second term as governor, O'Malley has been touring the country and said he's ""seriously thinking"" about a run for President in 2016.
His 34-second Snapchat cruised through Baltimore hot spots from Patterson Park to Locust Point, ending at Federal Hill, with the message: ""Saturday, May 30th; 10 a.m.""
A few minutes after sharing that he tweeted : ""Join me...for a special announcement"" and offered a website for those wishing to RSVP.

According to The Baltimore Sun, O'Malley held a rally at Federal Hill on the eve of his 2006 gubernatorial election.
The Democrat, whose previous posts include Baltimore mayor (1999-2007) and Maryland governor (2007-2015), has been speaking to grassroots activists in Iowa and New Hampshire but after the Baltimore riots last month, he reportedly abbreviated a trip in Europe to return to Charm City.
During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, O'Malley said he helped hand out food at St. Peter Claver Church and noted he started his career as a prosecutor in west Baltimore.
Asked whether he planned to return to Baltimore for his Presidential campaign announcement, O'Malley said: ""I wouldn't think of announcing anyplace else.""

Martin O'Malley say he is likely to declare his candidacy for the Democratic party's presidential nomination at a May 30 event in Baltimore.
The Washington Post reports O'Malley will join Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in challenging frontrunner Hillary Clinton for the nomination in 2016. Former Rhode Island governor and senator Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. James Webb have also been mentioned as possible Democratic candidates, while Vice President Joe Biden hasn't yet said if he will again seek the nomination.
O'Malley, 52, will tell supporters about the announcement in a conference call night, The Post says. An email to backers promised ""an important update on his imminent 2016 plans.""
O'Malley, who served the two-term limit for governor in Maryland, has been touring the country, and has said he's ""seriously thinking"" about a run for President in 2016. He spent time in the past year speaking to grassroots activities in Iowa, the first caucus state in the country, and the early primary state of New Hampshire.
O'Malley, arrived in New Hampshire Wednesday to campaign for Congressional candidates, attend house parties and take part in a private fundraiser for the House Democratic Caucus at the New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters.
In a January news conference, O'Malley said he is ""seriously thinking about"" running for president.
The former Baltimore mayor and his family have moved back to the city since he left the governor's mansion.
""I'm very seriously considering running in 2016,"" he said.
Last month O'Malley courted Iowans, who caucus in nine months, with a pro-union populist message. His biggest challenge may be his low name recognition in a state where voters are used to meeting presidential candidates one-on-one, quizzing them about issues.
Tom Henderson, chairman of the Polk County Democratic Party in Des Moines, told The Wall Street Journal Iowa voters will take O'Malley seriously because of his record that includes ending Maryland's death penalty, raising the minimum wage and legalizing same-sex marriage.
""Most Iowans want to look over all the candidates and make their own determination,"" Henderson told the WSJ. ""This is not done by any means and if Hillary Clinton takes the state for granted, she will not win.""
Mileah Kromer, a political scientist who oversees the Goucher poll and a professor at Goucher College, said in January that O'Malley's record, such as abolishing the death penalty and legalizing gay marriage, will play well with the Democratic primary electorate, but he will likely be unsuccessful in his bid for the presidency.

""Who am I campaigning for? Am I campaigning for me or am I campaigning for my constituents?"" Mikulski said. ""I had to decide how I would spend my time—fighting for my job or fighting for their job. Do I spend my time raising money, or do I spend my time raising hell?""
Mikulski continued: ""...it really became clear that I want to campaign for the people of Maryland. I want to make sure that they have a future, that they have a job. I'm here today in Fells Point to announce that I will not be seeking a sixth term in the U.S. Senate.""
The decision was not one that she made lightly, after a long career in politics that began on the Baltimore City Council in 1971. ""This has been a hard decision to make,"" Mikulski said. ""I will have served over 30 years.""
Mikulski, 78, was the first woman to chair the powerful Appropriations Committee, according to The Washington Post.
Currently in her fifth term as a U.S. Senator, Mikulski is known as the ""Dean"" of the Senate women and as someone who has forged bipartisan relationships for decades that often result in compromise.
For the remainder of her term, Mikulski said she plans to continue fighting for change.
""I want to give 120 percent of my time focused on my constituents. Because it's never been about me. It's always been about them,"" she said.
When a reporter asked if she had one particular accomplishment of which she was most proud, Mikulski said that it was not one piece of legislation, although she cited Rosa's law, which removed the term ""retarded"" from the health and education code in Maryland, a development she said originated out of a round table discussion in Anne Arundel County. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed an expansion of Rosa's lawinto federal law, requiring all health, labor and education laws to remove the term ""retarded"" and refer instead to people living with ""intellectual disability.""
Mikulski also mentioned her work to identify federal grants as a way to support local firefighters, whose equipment and engines could not be paid for by fundraisers alone.
""For me, it's not any one accomplishment. It's the joy of listening to the people, knowing what their needs are, responding to that need and trying to turn it into national policy,"" Mikulski said.
What do you see as Senator Mikulski's greatest accomplishment? Tell us in the comments!

16,/maryland/arbutus/hogan-new-bipartisan-spirit-starts-0,2015-01-21T20:36:08Z,Hogan: New Bipartisan Spirit Starts,0,0,Sydney Wu,Patch Staff,"Governor Lawrence J. Hogan Jr., of Edgewater, was sworn into office on Wednesday. He officially became the 62nd governor of the State of Maryland.
Here are his prepared remarks.
Governor Christie, thank you for being here, thanks for your tremendous support, and for that very kind introduction.
To my wife, Yumi, my daughters and my entire family, please know that it is because of your incredible love and support that I am able to stand here today.
I am privileged and proud to have Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford by my side. He has been more than a running mate. He is a friend. I am honored to serve with him.
Governor O'Malley, thank you for your gracious cooperation during the transition and for your years of public service.
Lt. Governor Brown, thank you for your service, not only to the state, but to our nation.
To my good friends Governor Ehrlich and Lt. Governor Steele, thank you for your leadership. It was an honor to serve in your administration.
Governor Hughes and Governor Mandel, thank you for all you have done for Maryland.
Senate President Miller, Speaker Busch, and members of the Maryland General Assembly, we have great challenges ahead of us, but I look forward to working together with each and every one of you.
Comptroller Franchot, Treasurer Kopp, and Attorney General Frosh, Chief Judge Barbera and the other members of the judiciary, Senators Mikulski and Cardin and members of our Congressional Delegation, and all the local elected officials and other dignitaries, thank you all for being here for this historic occasion.
Most importantly, I want to thank the citizens from all across our state, who put aside party politics and who came together and voted to change Maryland for the better.
I'm grateful, because I know something about putting aside partisanship in order to do the right thing.
Forty years ago, a Maryland Congressman, a Republican, sat on the House Judiciary Committee during Watergate, and the entire world was watching.
Would this man be willing to buck his own party, his own president, to do what he thought was right for the country?
Despite tremendous pressure, this statesman put aside partisanship and made the tough decision, and became the first Republican to come out for the impeachment of President Nixon.
That man was my dad, former Congressman Lawrence J. Hogan, Sr., who is here with us today.
He put aside party politics and his own personal considerations in order to do the right thing for the nation.
He taught me more about integrity in one day than most men learn in a lifetime, and I am so proud to be his son.
Ladies and gentlemen, today, we are gathered in front of our beautiful state house, which has been in service since 1772.
A few steps from where I'm standing is where General George Washington resigned his commission.
Two hundred and thirty one years ago, the Revolutionary War ended right here, inside this state house, with the ratification of the Treaty of Paris in 1784.
And just a few miles away from here, when the future of a fledgling nation was in doubt, Francis Scott Key penned the Star Spangled Banner during the War of 1812.
For Maryland, and for our nation, this is a place where great things begin, and where great things are accomplished.
Today, against this historic and majestic backdrop, Maryland once again starts a new chapter in our long, proud history.
Today's inauguration marks a new beginning for Maryland, and the limitless possibilities before us.
I am a lifelong Marylander who loves this state. Every great experience, every great memory, every great moment I have ever had in my life, has happened right here, in Maryland.
It is such an incredible honor to be standing before you today as the 62nd governor of the great state of Maryland.
I am truly humbled and deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve my fellow Marylanders, and I vow to work tirelessly every single day to prove worthy of this great honor that you have granted me.
Today, we celebrate a new beginning for Maryland, remembering our past, while striving for a better and more promising future.
The question isn't whether Maryland is a great state. The question is: What will we do, all of us, to reinvigorate this great state that we all love? What will we do to ensure that our future is better than our present or our past?
I believe that the time has come to cast aside the status quo, and to come together to build a better future for our state and all our citizens.
We must set the bar higher, and create a bolder vision of the future.
Let's create a Maryland that is thriving, growing, innovating, and is responsive to the needs of all its citizens. Let's strive to make Maryland the best place in America to work, raise a family, start a business, and even to retire.
Let us renew our sense of optimism, and make Maryland a place of unlimited promise.
Together, let's make Maryland a place that we can all be proud of again.
Today, I am reminded of those brave Marylanders who first came to this land seeking freedom and opportunity when they landed in St. Mary's City in 1634.
While the challenges facing us today are different, I know that the courage and the spirit of Marylanders is the same.
We seek the freedom to compete without the undue burden of high taxes and bureaucratic regulations, which make us less competitive. We seek opportunities to build better communities, better businesses, and better lives for ourselves, our children, and our children's children. And most of all, we cherish both the freedom and opportunity to decide our future.
And today, we celebrate that freedom and opportunity.
What I envision for Maryland is not just an economic and fiscal recovery, but a rebirth of our spirit, and a renewed commitment to our common purpose.
The citizens of Maryland expect great things from us, and they deserve great things from us.
Too often, we see wedge politics and petty rhetoric used to belittle our adversaries and inflame partisan divisions. But I believe that Maryland is better than this. Our history proves that we are better than this.
It is only when the partisan shouting stops that we can hear each other's voices and concerns.
I am prepared to create an environment of trust and cooperation, where the best ideas rise to the top based upon their merit, regardless of which side of the political debate they come from.
No problem faces us that hard work, honesty, and courage cannot solve if we work together.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can improve the tone in Annapolis, and we will. And we can move toward a common-sense, solutions-based government. The problems we face are great, but so is our resolve to fix them.
President Kennedy once said, ""Let us not seek the Republican answer, or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.""
In that spirit, let us sit down together and come up with real, bipartisan, common sense solutions to the serious problems that face us. That's what the people of Maryland voted for, it's what they want, and it's what they deserve.
The history of our great state is rich and deep, and our commitment to freedom and justice has always been our strength.
In 1649, the Maryland Toleration Act, one of the first laws that granted different faiths the right to freely worship, was enacted. Since then, over the many years, Maryland has blossomed into a state wonderfully defined by our vibrant culture of racial, ethnic, and religious diversity.
In our hearts, Marylanders are hard-wired for inclusiveness. It's who we are, it's our founding principle, it's part of our identity, and it is our greatest strength.
Our culture of tolerance and mutual respect must also extend to those with whom we happen to differ on politics.
Today is not the beginning of an era of divided government. Today is the beginning of a new spirit of bipartisan cooperation in Annapolis.
There is so much that unites us: a love of our state, a commitment to fairness, and a desire to be economically strong and successful.
And to those who would divide us, or drive us to the extremes of either political party, I remind you that Maryland has been called ""a state of middle temperament."" Our politics need that middle temperament as well.
The politics that have divided our nation need not divide our state.
In the days ahead, I ask all Marylanders to seek that middle ground, where we can all stand together.
I recognize that the events of 2014 stirred strong feelings throughout the nation. But in keeping with the moderate tradition of Maryland, we expressed our passions in a positive, open, respectful, and civil way, as concerned neighbors.
It's one of the many reasons I am proud to be a Marylander.
Our greatest challenge has always been reaching the high expectations set for us by our founders. That is why we will always keep trying, always keep growing, and why we shall never fail.
In the end, it isn't about politics; it's about citizenship, and the ability to understand the difference – that is what it means to be a Marylander.
Maryland's greatness is in her goodness. Partisanship should never denigrate the unique legacy entrusted to us by our founders.
To all my friends across the aisle, I assure you that partisanship will never play a role in my decision-making. Everything we do will be guided by four common-sense principles.
First: Fiscal responsibility.
Our state government must provide essential services, yet still live within its means. We must run our state government more efficiently and more cost effectively.
Second: Economic growth.
Maryland has an educated workforce, world-class universities and colleges, great community colleges, and public schools.
We have our beautiful Chesapeake Bay, the Port of Baltimore, and a great location in the heart of the Mid-Atlantic region. We must leverage these amazing assets to transform Maryland into a place where businesses can flourish and create more jobs and opportunities for our citizens.
Starting today let me say loudly and clearly: Maryland is open for business.
Third: Reform.
We must improve our state government's ability to be more responsive to, and to better serve and represent all of our citizens.
Fourth: Fairness.
We must restore a sense of fairness and balance for Maryland's hardworking and beleaguered taxpayers, in order to rebuild our forgotten middle class.
We must get the state government off our backs, and out of our pockets, so that we can grow the private sector, put people back to work, and turn our economy around.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can accomplish these things, and together we will.
This is our chance to build a government that works for the people, and not the other way around.
To accomplish these objectives will require leadership. I'm not talking about any one leader. It will take many, all of us, working together, rolling up our sleeves, acting with mutual respect, and doing our jobs for the people of Maryland.
It will require listening, education, and bold actions. And it will take the courage to do things differently.
A commitment to doing things differently will be challenging. But it will be worth it. We're worth it. And more importantly, Maryland is worth it.
One hundred years from now, I want Marylanders to say, ""This was when Maryland's renaissance began.""
Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today, full of hope, hope for our great state, hope for our people, and hope for our future.
I want Maryland's future, to be brighter than it's present, and brighter than it's past.
It can be, and it will be.
Before my father cast his vote on the impeachment committee, 40 years ago, he quoted President Lincoln, who said, ""We cannot escape history.""
And, we cannot escape our future – it's out there, waiting for us.
Let us show our fellow Marylanders that government can work, that we can work together, that change is possible, and that Maryland can live up to the promise of our founders.
Let us always act worthy of the great task entrusted to us, to renew and advance our great state.
Let us appeal to the better angels of our nature so that we can achieve the great and shining promise of Maryland.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can change Maryland for the better. And together, we will.
Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the great state of Maryland.

17,/maryland/arbutus/omalley-seriously-thinking-about-running-president-0,2015-01-19T03:40:13Z,O'Malley 'Seriously Thinking' About Running for...,0,0,Deb Belt,Patch Staff,"By Anjali Shastry
Capital News Service
Outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is ""seriously thinking about"" running for president, he said Friday at a news conference in the Maryland State House, despite the recent blow of his lieutenant governor not being elected to Maryland's highest office.
O'Malley's future includes joining the lecture circuit and working as a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University's Carey School of Business, where, he said, he would be taking part in modules of classes they offer and teaching about how to apply business principles to public policy and government.
After he leaves office, O'Malley said he is ""psyched"" that he and his family will settle down as private citizens in their hometown of Baltimore.
But it is safe to say that he is not yet done with elective office.
At his final news conference as the governor of Maryland, O'Malley answered questions about the biggest issues the state and country face, as well as fielded questions his potential presidential run.
""I'm very seriously considering running in 2016,"" he said, taking questions in the Governor's Reception Room.
This decision has been complicated by the fact that his lieutenant governor, Anthony G. Brown, lost the governor's race to Republican Larry Hogan, and that former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may run and is considered a favorite for the Democratic nomination. O'Malley said he has not made a decision yet, but is not taking Clinton's campaign decision into consideration.
Is 'O'Malley Fatigue Real?
Despite the fact that O'Malley disagreed with the tactical decisions Brown's campaign made, he praised Brown for never jumping ship or betraying that he had any reservations about O'Malley's political decisions while they were in office.
""As you all know, there were no popular choices to be made in keeping this ship moving forward and keeping it from taking on water,"" he said.
Todd Eberly, a professor of political science at St. Mary's College of Maryland, said ""O'Malley fatigue"" probably played a role in Brown's loss, he said, which might hurt O'Malley's chances in the 2016 election.
""Brown ran a horrible campaign. But at the same time, Brown attached himself to O'Malley's hip and didn't distance himself,"" Eberly said. ""He basically ran as a third term for O'Malley. If Brown ran a better campaign, maybe he could've balanced out O'Malley.""
Mileah Kromer, a political scientist who oversees the Goucher poll and a professor at Goucher College, said O'Malley's record, such as abolishing the death penalty and legalizing gay marriage, will play well with the Democratic primary electorate, but he will likely be unsuccessful in his bid for the presidency.
""He has all these really great talking points, which don't matter until we figure out what Hillary Clinton is doing,"" Kromer said. ""This is the battle he faces, and what every other Democratic contender faces right now.""
Positions Play Well in Primary Says Pollster
O'Malley also highlighted education and the economy as the biggest issues the state and country face.
""The problem we need to solve is how to make the economy work for all of us again,"" he said, pointing to Maryland as the state with the highest median income in America and the Pew Foundation's ranking of the state as top three for upward economic mobility.
As proud as he is of the way Maryland's economy has begun to bounce back from the recession, O'Malley said, he is still concerned about the ripple effects of the government shutdown and sequester on the state's economy.
In his last address to the General Assembly on Thursday, O'Malley emphasized bipartisanship as the key to keeping the government moving smoothly as the Democratic-majority legislature works with Republican Gov.-elect Hogan.
O'Malley on Friday described his own record of bipartisanship as positive with the Republicans in the General Assembly, and said that 70 percent of the legislative agenda his office submitted to the legislature was received positively by Republicans.
""The ones that make the news are the most contentious ones,"" he said.
Bipartisan Partnership in Legislature Questioned
Outgoing Delegate Kelly Schulz, who will take over as secretary of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, said that the large items were not received well by the Republican members of the legislature.
""My assumption would be that it is somewhat less than 70 percent,"" Schulz said.
Seventy percent of the legislation could have been received positively by the Republicans, Eberly said, but only if you consider the entirety of a legislative agenda.
""The hot button issues are where you can gauge bipartisanship, and on these issues, he was a happy partisan,"" Eberly said.
""Most are mundane, routine stuff that receives bipartisan support, because that's not what really matters. Funds, same-sex marriage, gun control, that's where you learn if someone's interested in bipartisanship or just pursuing their own agenda. If he runs on the basis that he can be bipartisan, there's no record for that.""

18,/maryland/arbutus/how-republican-larry-hogan-won-blue-maryland-0,2014-11-08T17:35:35Z,How Republican Larry Hogan Won in Blue Maryland,0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"By Lejla Sarcevic and Max Bennett, CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE
Republican Larry J. Hogan Jr. pulled off a remarkable electoral triumph Tuesday to defeat Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown in Maryland's gubernatorial election.
Pundits and politicians have been left with plenty to discuss as they reflect on a surprising Hogan campaign, and consider the future of the Democratic party.
What do you think was key to Hogan's win? Tell us in the comments!
Despite a fundraising advantage through the general election, including direct donations of about $4 million to the campaign and $1.6 to the Maryland Democratic Party, and a strong political machine, Brown faltered in the final weeks.
Hogan, 58, who chose to take public funding, was limited to $2.6 million, although other groups spent money on his behalf.
Governors' associations for both parties each spent over $1 million in ad buys, according to state campaign finance filings and a statement from the Republican Governors Association. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, chairman of the RGA, campaigned for Hogan several times in the final weeks.
""It was a combination of a bad campaign and a bad environment that pretty much did Anthony Brown in. That's the simple explanation,"" said Josh Kurtz, political blogger with Center Maryland.
Hogan is the son of former U.S. Rep. Larry J. Hogan Sr., who represented Maryland's 5th Congressional District—now occupied by U.S. House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.
The younger Hogan, a successful businessman, campaigned on a promise of being a financial manager for the state.
Hogan's tax-cutting, pro-business message hit a nerve: Polls leading up to Tuesday's win showed that the economy and jobs concern Maryland voters the most, followed by taxes, and education.
""That was brilliant, he made it a single-issue campaign,"" said Blair Lee IV, a long-time political commentator. ""Hogan was able to handcuff him to the O'Malley record.""
By using this strategy, Lee said, Hogan undermined Brown's message at every step.
""I think there has to be recognition because (Hogan's) message carried,"" said outgoing Attorney General Doug Gansler, whom Brown defeated in the Democratic primary. ""The message he brought to voters was the economy was not doing well and the tax burden was part of that.""
Travelling around the state in a large Hogan/Rutherford campaign bus, Hogan told voters he was not a politician, and characterized himself as a Maryland businessman, concerned about O'Malley-era tax hikes. However, politics have been a part of his life since his father's first run for Congress, when the young Hogan attended rallies and helped his father hand out pamphlets.
""Hogan was driving his bus all over the state,"" Gansler said. ""If you are holding yourself out there as a leader of the state, you need to go across the state.""
Brown appeared less accessible to media and voters; for example, he did not take questions after several debates, unlike Hogan, who made himself available for a few minutes each time.
Brown's campaign staff could not be reached for comment.
Hogan is the owner and president of The Hogan Companies, a real estate brokerage firm he started in the mid-1980s that has to date handled over $2 billion in property transactions.
In the administration of Gov. Robert Ehrlich Jr., Hogan served as appointments secretary, a cabinet-level position where he familiarized himself with the ins and outs of Annapolis.
Hogan's campaign was bolstered by the national political climate, which turned its back on Democrats across the country.
It's a pattern that has manifested itself in Maryland previously: In 1994, Republican Ellen Sauerbrey came within 6,000 votes of beating Democrat Parris Glendening; and in 2002, a post-9/11 nation rallied around President George W. Bush, and the Maryland electorate handed Ehrlich the governorship.
In 2010, the conservative Tea Party movement surged nationally, but largely bypassed blue Maryland, said Lee. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 in the state.
""They thought they had a mandate to keep taxing because they weren't hurt in 2010. Now they've been punished,"" Lee said.
O'Malley's larger political aspirations also may have played a role in Brown's disappointing loss.
""His whole campaign for president has been an affront to the people of Maryland,"" Lee said. ""Every time there was a headline 'O'Malley is in Iowa,' 'O'Malley is in New Hampshire,' Brown lost a vote.""
But in the last three weeks, O'Malley attended about three dozen events for the Brown/Ulman campaign -- appearing at sign wavings, campaign offices and rallies, according to an official with the governor's PAC.
""The governor worked hard to elect Lt. Gov. Brown—attending countless events, raising money, and organizing support — and was disappointed with the outcome of the race,"" said Lis Smith, spokeswoman for O'Malley's O'Say Can You See PAC.
Hogan remained confident throughout the campaign, despite the fact that most polls showed Brown holding on to win.
The polls tripped up analysts at Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight site, a polling aggregation blog, which predicted a 10-point Brown win. Hogan won by more than 4 percentage points.
Harry J. Enten, a senior political writer and analyst with FiveThirtyEight, said that political observers were thrown by the result because news organizations stopped polling Maryland with a month to go before the election.

""The (Washington) Post and (Baltimore) Sun stopped polling the race in early October,"" Enten said.
Enten added that even Wilson Perkins Allen, a Republican-leaning research and polling firm, didn't see Hogan ahead until the last week.
Hogan endured continuing attack ads from Brown's camp, most of which sought to paint the GOP challenger as a dangerous social conservative. Hogan refused to take the bait and continued down the fiscal path.
""He was speaking to the No. 1 concern of Maryland voters,"" Lee said. ""It was not abortion, it was not gun control.""
Maryland Democrats have been left leaderless and someone will need to pick up the pieces, some observers noted.
The field is now wide open and the leadership for the taking. Some pundits have named Comptroller Peter Franchot, Attorney General-elect Brian Frosh, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker III, and Brown's running mate, Howard County Executive Ken Ulman.
""Who is the head of the Democratic party? The answer is Peter Franchot,"" Lee said. ""He can say 'I told you so.'""
Franchot, who has positioned himself as the fiscal watchdog of Maryland's Democratic party, was a tremendous help to Hogan, Lee said.
""I think for the first years, he and Hogan will work well together,"" said Todd Eberly, assistant professor of political science and coordinator of public policy studies at St. Mary's College of Maryland. ""They both seem bipartisan and into compromise.""
Eberly said he can see Franchot running against Hogan in 2018 if he is ""shrewd and wise.""
""It puts him in an enviable position thinking about four years from now,"" he said.
Kurtz said there is no shortage of potential leaders waiting in the wings.
Democratic strongholds are concentrated in Prince George's and Montgomery counties and Baltimore City, and Brown needed a strong showing in those jurisdictions to carry him over the line.
Despite Brown winning all three, plus Charles County, Delegate Ana Sol Gutierrez, D-Montgomery County, said Montgomery did not live up to its turnout standards.
""We definitely underperformed,"" she said.
Gutierrez said Montgomery County's lower turnout may have determined the outcome of the race.
Brown earned nearly 152,000 votes in the county in 2014, out of 245,636 voters, according to preliminary results.
In 2010, the O'Malley-Brown ticket earned almost 199,000 votes out of 291,873 voters in Montgomery.
Delegate Aisha N. Braveboy, D-Prince George's County, pointed to a lack of grassroots organization and efforts supporting Brown at the precinct level.
Brown, who lives in Prince George's County, should have garnered more than the just over 175,000 votes he received, said Braveboy. Early results indicate 207,706 Prince George's County residents cast their ballots this year.
In the 2010 gubernatorial election, turnout for O'Malley and Brown totaled 203,957 voters in the county out of 231,836 who cast their ballots, according to the State Board of Elections.
Not only was overall voter turnout lower in 2014, but the Democratic gubernatorial ticket's share of that total also dropped in both Prince George's and Montgomery counties.
""We should have come out in stronger numbers to support him"" this year, Braveboy said.
While turnout for Brown was not what she hoped, Braveboy said, the black community came out strong in the districts where blacks hold a majority of the voting bloc.
""What that tells me is that angry Democrats came out to vote (for Hogan) and a lot of traditional Democrats stayed home,"" Lee said.
Hogan garnered 851,366 votes to Brown's 774,383 statewide this year, according to preliminary data from the Maryland Board of Elections.
On election night, Brown's stunned supporters watched as returns slowly, then decisively, ran in Hogan's favor, and then, the crowd began to thin. Brown conceded just after midnight.
""We're in shock,"" said Devang Shah of the governor's commission on South Asian affairs at Brown's election night party at Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center at the University of Maryland. ""We took the election for granted. Republicans did not. The only way Democrats can lose in this state is if we don't show up.""

For the last 30 years, all the tolls, fees and fines you may have thought were being used to help maintain the roads may have been spent elsewhere.
""That's not fair to the residents and voters of Maryland,"" said Andrew Feldman, a spokesman for the Committee to Protect Maryland Transportation Fund.
To provide more protection for the Transportation Trust Fund, Question One on the 2014 general election ballot outlines additional provisions safeguarding the money.

Here's what the question looks like on the ballot.
Question One would amend the process of approving Maryland Constitution to protect the state's Transportation Trust Fund.
Question 1 - Non-Technical Summary
Constitutional Amendment (Ch. 422 of the 2013 Legislative Session)
Transportation Trust Fund – Use of Funds
(Amending Article III by adding Section 53 to the Maryland Constitution)
Limits the use of Transportation Trust Funds to the payment of principal and interest on transportation bonds and for constructing and maintaining an adequate highway system or any other transportation-related purpose. Also prohibits the transfer of Transportation Trust Funds into the General Fund or a special fund of the State, except for: (1) an allocation or use of highway user revenues for local governments or (2) a transfer of funds to the Maryland Transportation Authority or the Maryland Transportation Authority Fund. Transportation Trust Funds may be used for non-transportation related purposes or transferred to the general fund or a special fund only if the Governor declares a fiscal emergency and the General Assembly approves legislation, by a three-fifths vote of both houses, concurring with the use or transfer of the funds.
