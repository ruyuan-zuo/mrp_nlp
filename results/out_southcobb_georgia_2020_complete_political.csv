House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, two police officers and two others were shot at a baseball practice at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. The gunman, identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson, an Illinois businessman, was killed in a shootout with Virginia and U.S. Capitol Police.
""This is a shocking act of violence in Virginia and I'm praying for all those wounded in this morning's shooting,"" Ossoff said in a Twitter post. (To get notified of more local news like this, click here to sign up for the East Cobb Patch. Or find your Atlanta-area town here. Or, if you have an iPhone, download the free Patch app.)

""The whole country is shaken as well as united in prayer for those fighting for their lives and in appreciation for the first responders and police for saving lives today. Despite our differences of opinion, Americans must redouble our commitments to national unity, civility, and the rule of law.""
Handel said in a statement, ""My thoughts are with the victims of this morning's despicable, unprovoked attack on the Republican congressional softball team. Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers.""

Authorities investigating the shooting said Hodgkinson made disparaging comments online about President Donald Trump and other Republican politicians -- Handel said that she was one of them.
""I am aware that the suspect recently made vile comments about me on social media,"" she said in a statement. ""It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views.
The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that a social media account believed to belong to Hodgkinson blasted Handel in a profane post. ""Republican [expletive] Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It's Right for You!"" a post attributed to the gunman said on June 8.
Handel said that Americans must rise about politics and unite in a ""civil and productive"" way.
""We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way. Now more than ever, we must unite as a one nation under God. It is incumbent upon all of us to work together in a civil and productive way, even when we disagree.""
Handel and Ossoff are locked in a tight race that will culminate in Tuesday's runoff for the 6th District, which includes the affluent Atlanta suburbs encompassing Cobb, Fulton and DeKalb counties.

HB 722 is up for a vote in the state House Judiciary Non-Civil Committee, reports 11 Alive. The bill provides further guidelines for the use of cannabis oil for medical purposes.
State Rep. Allen Peake (R-Macon) has been an advocate of allowing the drug's use for medical purposes for several years. However, Peake has reportedly agreed to remove the controversial provision from the bill.
In 2015, the General Assembly passed a law allowing the use of a certain type of cannabis oil. But under the law, anyone using the drug has to travel to other states to obtain it.
State law enforcement officials have expressed concern recently that allowing the product to be grown in-state would lead to rising crime and drug addiction rates, according to High Times.

12,/georgia/southcobb/marriage-right-same-sex-couples-us-supreme-court-decision,2015-06-26T19:31:04Z,Marriage a Right for Same-Sex Couples in U.S....,0,0,Patch Staff,Patch Staff,"By GREG HAMBRICK (Patch Staff)
In a 5-4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, same-sex marriage is now legal nationwide. The decision brings same-sex marriage to Georgia for the first time.
The decision was authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was joined by the four more liberal judges.
According to the decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, ""The Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State.""
Gov. Nathan Deal said Georgia would abide by the ruling.
""While I believe that this issue should be decided by the states and by legislatures, not the federal judiciary, I also believe in the rule of law,"" Deal said in a statement. ""The state of Georgia is subject to the laws of the United States, and we will follow them.""
State Attorney General Samuel Olens has instructed all state agencies to comply with the Supreme Court decision:
""This mandate requires Georgia to recognize same sex marriage in the same way it recognizes marriage between a man and a woman. Georgia's local governments are now constitutionally required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, to issue those licenses in the same way and via the same procedures employed for all other applicants, and to recognize same-sex marriages on an equal footing with all other marriages.""
An impossible act 12 years ago, same-sex marriage now exists in 37 states, primarily due to a wave of court decisions, along with the actions of a handful of state legislators and voter referendums.
The key victory came in a Supreme Court decision in 2013. In a 5-4 decision, the justices struck down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The decision didn't address equality nationwide, but the reasoning used by the court would be applied again and again in lower court decisions that overturned state bans.
In October 2014, the Supreme Court refused to hear appeals from same-sex marriage opponents in five states, paving the way for nuptials in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and eventually ending bans in Colorado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming.
That move by the justices was largely seen as the first indication that the Supreme Court was prepared to address the marriage issue. In January, the justices announced they would consider the 6th District case where the appeals court upheld same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Tennessee.
Today's ruling comes during a time of historic support for same-sex-marriage. American's attitudes have shifted swiftly and dramatically in the last decade, according to public opinion polls. Only 27 percent of Americans thought gay marriage should be legal when the Gallup Poll began posing the question in 1996; last month, support had soared to 60 percent, up from 55 percent just a year ago.

Gov. Nathan Deal is joining a growing list of southern politicians who are trying to cut down on the display of the Confederate flag following a racially-motivated mass shooting in Charleston.
The Georgia governor has proposed changes to the state's license plates which recognize the Sons of Confederate Veterans organization. Deal tells the Atlanta Journal-Constitution he would like to remove the large Confederate flag that makes up the background of the entire plate.
Deal's call to change the plate came just thirty minutes after he publicly announced that he would not press for action on the issue; the governor told reporters that he wanted to make sure that Confederate flag license plates did not become an issue in Georgia.
Governors in other southern states are moving towards an outright removal of Confederate flag license plates; top pols in North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee have expressed support for the discontinuation of what Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said was an ""unnecessarily divisive and hurtful"" symbol.
Each governor cited the recent Supreme Court decision in Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans as a legal groundwork for phasing out the design. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 18 that license plate designs were government speech and therefore less strictly monitored than public speech; if the State of Texas did not want to issue a license plate displaying a Confederate flag, that was their right and not a First Amendment violation.
Deal told WSB-TV he believed that an individual choosing to display such a license plate was a personal matter and very different from flying a Confederate flag on state property or having a state flag which contains a portion of the design.
11 Alive News reported that Deal will speak with representatives of the Sons of Confederate Veterans to work out a compromise on the new design. Deal said he didn't think the organization would support complete removal of their emblem, which bears a Confederate flag, from the license plate.
While other southern states are considering removing the Confederate flag from their state flags, Deal expressed gratitude that predecessors Roy Barnes and Sonny Perdue fought to have Georgia's state flag redesigned a decade ago; the Confederate flag was added to Georgia's state flag in 1956 and was removed in 2003, though Georgia's state flags have had some resemblance to the Confederate Stars and Bars flag since 1879."

Nathan Deal has drawn criticism for an incorrect presumption that a Hispanic student who was quizzing him at a University of Georgia forum on immigration was an undocumented immigrant.
Four University of Georgia student activists questioned Deal during a speech on campus Tuesday night over the state Board of Regents policy prohibiting undocumented immigrants from attending UGA, reports Flagpole magazine.
The exchange between one student and Deal provoked boos from student Republicans in the crowd who supported Deal and criticism from immigration activists.
In answer to a student's question, here's what WGCL TV says was shared:
""There's a fundamental problem that can only be resolved at the Congressional level and that is to deal with the issue of children, and I presume you probably fit the category, children who were brought here,"" said Deal, who was looking toward Lizbeth Miranda, a Hispanic student who was asking questions.
""I'm not an illegal immigrant. I'm not,"" Miranda replied. ""I don't know why you would have thought that I was undocumented. Was it because I look Hispanic?""
The governor replied: ""I apologize if I insulted you. I did not intend to.""
Campaign spokesman Brian Robinson said after the event sponsored by the UGA College Republicans that the governor was referring to Carver Goodhue, who is white, as presumably being undocumented.
Miranda told the magazine Deal was looking at her, and the other students with her said they thought he was referring to their group, the Undocumented Students Alliance. Members said they found the governor's statement offensive.
""I think realistically he'll have to do some political backtracking as he prepares for the campaign, because the Hispanic community is getting very large in Georgia so he's going to have to cover himself there,"" Goodhue told the TV station.
Deal's campaign said the students ambushed the governor.
""The governor was trying to have a civil conversation with a group determined to have a confrontation,"" said ""He was courteous and civil,"" said Robinson. The entire thing was misrepresented.""

To gauge the scope of gender-based disparities in the United States, WalletHub ranked each of the 50 states based on 10 key metrics, ranging from the gap in the number of female and male executives to the disparity between women's and men's life expectancy and the imbalance of their political representation.
To see the full report, click here.
Hawaii topped the list, followed by New York, Maryland, Maine and Nevada. Landing at the bottom of the list at No. 50 was Wyoming.
Neighboring Florida ranked 43rd overall, South Carolina was 30th and Alabama came in at No. 26.
Women in general live longer than men, while men in every state earn more, fill more executive jobs, and work longer hours, the report says. One area where there is equality: unemployment.
WalletHub says the unemployment rate is equal for men and women in Arizona, Arkansas and California. West Virginia has the highest gap favoring women, with 2.8% more unemployed men. Georgia has the highest gap favoring men, with 1.5% more unemployed women.
The report was released in advance of Tuesday, which is Women's Equality Day.
