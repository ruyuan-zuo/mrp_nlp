The Gods of Irony are enjoying their view right now – watching as the consequences of a failed MARTA referendum, a divisive Legislative Session, and a gross violation of the rights of Gwinnett County voters have all been piled on in just the last couple of months, showing us what happens when the few decide the fate of the many.
With the MARTA referendum, voter turnout clocked in at a mere 92,000 votes cast — compared to more than 300,000 ballots in the recent midterm election cycle, with long, irritating Gwinnett commutes married to widespread voter apathy and election shenanigans the likely culprits. Just over 16% of registered voters voted. That's less than in the previous 2 SPLOST referendums.
For reasons passing understanding, the Republican punditry has reported the anemic numbers as ""a surprisingly big turnout for this kind of election."" While the statement isn't entirely untrue, it's a shockingly complacent position on the lack of any general interest in local elections and doesn't acknowledge the cynically political decision to place the referendum in March, rather than on the November ballot.
The truth is that local elections like the transit referendum, and even state legislative races, typically only register a blip in the minds of voters, which is a betrayal to the hard reality that the majority of governing that affects our daily lives takes place not in Washington, but right here at home. It was not far away leaders in DC that passed one of the most intrusive Anti-Choice bills in the country, stripping women of their rights as individuals; it was not DC Republicans that put the referendum on an off-year March ballot. As Georgian Democrats, we need to be as concerned with energizing local elections as we are in driving primary voters out for the presidential cycle.
That said, it's a rare opportunity for politicians when we can introduce a measure that will improve people's lives, strengthen our democracy, and give voice to those who struggle to be heard without it costing a dime. The time has come to make Election Day a holiday as it is the case in other states and many other countries around the world. At a minimum, Gwinnett County should lead by example. That's precisely what our campaign is proposing: making Election Day a county holiday. As Gwinnett's next County Chair, instead of celebrating Columbus Day (a day mostly reserved for shopping mall sales, since Columbus neither discovered America nor left a great legacy of his treatment of the indigenous Americans he found) we can have a real celebration of our democracy and still be revenue neutral. What better way to celebrate democracy than to make it work better for everyone?
This proposal works two ways. First, it recognizes the reality of County workers, many of whom are raising children — some of which are single-parent homes where time is always at a premium. Even with the expansion of early voting, these voters struggle for every minute. These are the very people whose voices need to be heard, so making it easier for them to be heard without costing the county anything for that convenience is beyond a no-brainer. Georgia has been taking it on the chin in the press for its voting rights record, so this measure hedges against those criticisms while helping real people.
The second way it works is that it sets an example for private businesses in Gwinnett County to follow suit with an Election Day holiday. This is important because while unemployment has dropped, underemployment — the experience of working hard for less than a living wage — has risen dramatically. These are the people who scoff at the news of all the new jobs being created, because they already have three of them.
In that spirit of bringing more Gwinnettians into the process, let's work together to ensure that our local democracy–our very rights of self-determination–like our commuter-base, doesn't end up getting stuck in traffic."
1,/georgia/buford/future-our-census,2019-04-26T02:31:18Z,The Future of Our Census,0,0,Curt Thompson,Community Contributor,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
With the Supreme Court poised to issue an astronomically important ruling regarding the census, it's worth examining how important the census actually is.
The census isn't just another Buzzfeed personality quiz you take while avoiding work. It's a way for the government to analyze the varying demographics in each region, which then allows them to carefully reapportion House seats as well as federal funding and taxes. Our representation–the very essence of our constitution–is based on the results of the census. In short, it affects almost every part of our life from our political values to our tax forms to whether or not we can build more highways that'll get us faster to work. However, this crucial survey is on the brink of being discriminatorily skewed due to conservative efforts to add a citizenship question to the census.
The Trump administration trying to push the citizenship question will no doubt decrease the number of respondents. Justice Sonia Sotomayor affirmed, ""If you're talking about prediction, this is about 100 percent that people will answer less."" Census officials estimate that around 6.5 million people will be discouraged from completing the census, especially the states and urban areas with densely populated Hispanic and immigrant communities. As there is a high correlation of these communities voting Democratic, this will adversely harm civic engagement and voter turnout. A subtle power flex on the conservatives' part, and if the citizenship question passes, it will unethically distort voter representation. This is a clear attempt on the part of the Trump administration to take representative power away from densely populated Democratic areas and redistribute it to Republican states.
Furthermore, the Supreme Court, the ultimate decision-maker of this case, is currently leaning conservative. After Trump appointed Justice Kavanaugh, the political divide tipped to right, giving Trump more leverage to his controversial initiatives. While conservatives argue that adding the citizenship question will enforce the Voting Rights Act, lawyers like Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties have outspoken about how this claim is simply not true. Kavanaugh has also suggested that the United Nations recommends asking a citizenship question on the survey, but the reality is that citizenship is a sensitive question for Americans especially with threats of deportation becoming ever more serious. The question was taken out in 1950 to increase compliance rates, so to revert back is begging for lower participation, which is the end game for most conservative legislators. With an administration devoted to sowing fear and mistrust among immigrant communities, this is simply the latest example.
This is yet another painful reminder that elections have consequences. When Democrats lost the Presidency in 2016, we missed the chance to fill the seats currently occupied by Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. When we lost seats in the Senate, we lost our opportunity to block judges who seek to force a conservative-activist agenda on America, rather than upholding precedent and the Constitution.
We cannot stand idly by and powerlessly take the blow simply because there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. We must contact our Congressional representatives and voice our concern against this initiative, or we may witness the undercount of millions of votes in the 2020 election race. Most of all, make sure to vote in every election. It is our constitutional duty and has far-reaching consequences. Let's work together to withstand those who seek to diminish our voices."

It's astonishing that just days before Easter during the Holy Week, tragedy befell one of the most sacred sites in history. The Notre Dame Cathedral is meaningful to more than just Catholics. It is an 800 year old masterpiece that served as the foundation for Parisian tradition and a symbol of civilization. I can still recall the grandeur of its Rose Glass window, flying buttresses, and ancient gargoyles back from when I visited the cathedral with my mother for her 50th birthday. Perhaps that is why watching the live coverage of the flames engulfing the Cathedral and the collapse of the renowned spire struck me more deeply. As we take the time to mourn the loss of part of our history, let us recognize how we as a society reflect on tragedies.
Thankfully, there were no casualties and the fire is presumed to be an accident. Nonetheless, the incident deeply hurt Parisians who consider the site to be the center of Paris, as well as the world, who all knew the immense cultural history contained in one building. Local Parisians have come together, religious or not, in prayer and reflection. On television, world viewers are hearing them sing Ave Maria, and going back to their local parishes and homes to spread the healing spirit. The Notre Dame fire has, at least temporarily, brought us all together as we pay homage to something grander than ourselves.
It almost seems impossible that the France showing such unity is the same France that was suffering from political turmoil and street riots just days before. In fact, we see the same reruns in America. A tragedy comes, we mourn together, and then we move on to the next divisive issue a horrific and sad truth. What's most saddening is that it always takes a tragedy like Notre Dame for us to put our issues behind us and come together, only for us to return to our old divisive ways as soon as the headline changes.
So, how should we handle tragedies such as these? The answer is not retreating back to our own familiar values. It never will be. Instead, we should understand that there is a broader world around us, a beautiful world filled with blooming cultural diversity and centuries of history. We must not burn the bridges of culture that do not resemble our own, but build those bridges that allow us to form deeper connections with our communities, new and old. Let Notre Dame be a lesson of reconciliation and restored faith in society."

On April 2nd, Georgia's state legislature finally ended their three-month session with some important bills that Governor Kemp can pass or veto. These bills could affect all of us, for better or worse. Here is the list of the top bills or amendments that were taken up this session:
First, HB 481, more commonly known as the ""heartbeat bill."" This bill that was recently passed by the GA House restricts women from receiving an abortion if the doctor detects a ""heartbeat"" from the embryo, which can happen as early as in six weeks. What's controversial about this regulation is that, according to the Feminist Women's Health Center in Atlanta, most patients do not know that they are even pregnant at six weeks. As a pro-choice advocate, this is troubling because women cannot make a conscientious decision while barred in a such a short time frame. In fact, Georgia's law, if signed by Governor Kemp, will directly challenge Roe v. Wade, the legal federal precedent set by the Supreme Court--which was the goal to protect women's rights from the very beginning. Now, that the heartbeat bill is ready to be signed by Kemp, who has been a pro-life advocate, it is more important than ever for all of us to make our voice count by directly contacting the governor's office.
Next is SB 200, a transportation bill which contained an important amendment that would another transit referendum in Gwinnett until 2026. Republicans proposed the amendment claiming that the 2019 election results needed a ""cooling off period so the will of the voters is respected."" This is incredibly dirty politics and spin because the special election's mere 17% voter turnout, the outcome can is anything but representative. The vote was placed in March specifically to drive down turnout and cause it to fail, which worked. If we really want to know the ""will of the voters,"" we will hold the next referendum on the November 2020 ballot. Thankfully, this amendment was rejected and Gwinnett's voters retain the right to make their own choices about Gwinnett.
The 40-day legislative session also discussed an important issue that is on my agenda: medical marijuana. Many Georgians, especially children, require medical marijuana to treat severe seizures, cancers, and other chronic illnesses. HB 324 allows for several private companies and state universities to legally cultivate marijuana, which would then be distributed to pharmacies for those with a medical marijuana marijuana prescription. This bill, which Kemp has said he will sign, is a great step in the right direction, but I would like to see the legislature go further next session.
Last but not least, the past legislative session finally passed what could become Georgia's first enactment of hate crimes legislation. Hate can be inflicted as a weapon to intimidate or harass a specific group of people, which hinders the democratic values of equality and freedom. HB 426 heightens the penalties of hate crimes that can be ""because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, 19 national origin, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability"" up to 12 months in prison or a fine of $5,000. Establishing hate crimes legislation will positively impact our communities with more love and understanding for one another.
These influential bills will affect all of our communities in one way or another. However, it is always important to keep in mind that while Governor Kemp may be the one signing or vetoing these bills, it is our voice he should be representing. Just because a bill has been passed or dismissed during the legislative session does not mean it is official law yet. Governor Kemp has 40 days from April 2nd to sign or veto these bills. So, I encourage you to continue contacting Kemp's office and making your voice count. Call him at 404-656-1776 or email him at georgia.governor@gov.state.ga.us. You may also write letters of concern to the following mail address [206 Washington Street, Suite 203, State Capitol, Atlanta, GA 30334]. Let's continue the good fight and build a bridge toward Gwinnett's future!"
4,/georgia/buford/lessons-christchurch,2019-03-22T03:15:40Z,Lessons from Christchurch,0,0,Curt Thompson,Community Contributor,"This post was contributed by a community member. The views expressed here are the author's own.
In the wake of the New Zealand mass shooting, which took 50 lives, New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is handling the tragedy in a way that few leaders have done before. As a nation in constant struggle with gun violence, there's a lot we can learn from, and reflect upon, in regards to the Christchurch shooting.
Mass shootings come as no surprise to Americans as we've witnessed dozens in the past several years from the Orlando shooting at a gay nightclub to the Parkland school shooting. Gun violence becomes a hot topic when another shooting occurs, but the issue always remains stuck in rhetoric and never makes it to meaningful legislation. Prime Minister Arden, however, has responded to the attack with immediate action, including several proposals to reform the country's existing gun laws.
But more importantly, Ms. Ardern is being praised for approaching the incident with sympathy and love. Labeling the shooting as an act of terror and extremism, the New Zealand leader is focusing on addressing the ideologies underlying the incident, rather than just blaming the shooter himself. In fact, Ms. Ardern comforted the victims' families while wearing a black scarf that covered her head, which is a small, but remarkable, gesture since Muslim headwear unfortunately holds immense stigma in Western countries.
Meanwhile, President Trump sent out his condolences in a plain tweet that failed to explicitly mention his sympathy with the global Muslim community. In a recent interview, Trump asserted his view that white supremacy is ""not a rising threat,"" but the New Zealand shooting and much evidence proves otherwise. A recent Washington Post article notes that ""A February report released by the Southern Poverty Law Center found 1,020 hate groups across the United States in 2018 — an all-time high — as well as an increase in the death toll… with white supremacists in the United States and Canada killing at least 40 people."" Islamophobia and white supremacy are dangerous threats, not just to the United States or New Zealand, but to our increasingly connected world.
We cannot allow more malicious shootings to simply come and go on the news headlines. We must combat the bigotry and prejudice with both law enforcement and cultural change. We must come together and embrace our Muslim brothers and sisters. Hate has no home here, and it never will. Let us remember the lost victims of the New Zealand shooting as we build a new bridge of love and cultural understanding within our communities. We should also look to New Zealand and their leadership as a model of how to handle these tragedies. Sadly our country and our President are not."

A recently filed federal lawsuit has charged Georgia's four most populated counties–Gwinnett, Fulton, Cobb, and Dekalb–with inadequate election preparation. This lawsuit, filed by the ACLU of Georgia, alleges that, in spite of high voter turnout at the last midterm election, these county governments did not provide adequate polling locations, voting equipment, nor staff. Voting rights groups have asked that the counties implement the necessary changes before the 2020 election, but any action depends on the outcome of the case.
The lawsuit in and of itself points toward a bigger issue: the complexity of voter suppression. Nowadays, news headlines seem to solely concentrate on voter purging and forget that there are other, more subtle methods of deterring voters. In fact, Cobb, Dekalb, and Fulton County all reported having very long lines at the polls because there were not enough locations. Gwinnett, on the other hand, has also been dealing with disproportionate amount of absentee ballots being rejected, which Democratic candidates Stacey Abrams and Carolyn Bourdeaux have spoken out on. Elections are officially under state jurisdiction, but ACLU claims that there are definitely operational problems which are ""directly traceable"" to counties' poor management.
However, with the bad news comes opportunities for us to all take action to protect and improve our voting systems. Recognizing the various layers of the issue means that there are multiple ways to combat voter suppression. We're not here to blame the entire election on the secretary of state's office or argue that it's all due to touch screen voting machines. No, we're here to address this problem one step at a time. While many issues have to be dealt with at the state and federal level, Gwinnett County has its part to do as well. Starting with opening up more polling locations, investing in more early voting and weekend voting locations and longer polling hours, having more voting machines if we end up using them, working out cooperative agreements with our cities to conduct municipal elections in the same polling places and at the same times as other county elections, and having more volunteers to provide greater accessibility. As Gwinnett County Commission Chair, I promise to provide greater accessibility for voters to exercise their constitutional right and make their voice count, and I promise our Board of Elections and their staff will be charged with making voting as easy and simple as the law allows, not as difficult and cumbersome as you can possibly interpret a statute.
It is imperative the county governments can adequately handle large-turnout elections so we can ensure we are being accurately represented. Protect your vote by speaking out and contacting your local legislators. As your County Chair, I will carefully listen to your concerns, whether it be a particular precinct you know with unreasonably long lines or people you know whose votes were not counted in the last election. All of your concerns are my concerns. Do not hesitate to voice your opinions, as each and every one is vital to the representation of our community. I understand that this can be a scary situation, because not having your voice heard before any election can certainly put us in a position to not even want to vote. However, I still urge you to go out and vote, and to make your own voices count. And, if that isn't enough, once elected, I will ensure that I make your voices count towards our future.
Let's not allow voter suppression to obstruct us from being represented. Instead, let's build a bridge to Gwinnett's inclusive and exciting future–one without voter suppression.

As a lifelong resident of Gwinnett, I have been able to see how much our county has grown and changed over the years. We are now one of the most diverse counties in the nation—boasting languages, ethnicities, races, and cultures from all across the globe. Our county has also become increasingly progressive recently, and with the delegation to the General Assembly becoming Democratic for the first time in decades after this last election. However, the county's leadership remains relatively unchanged.
After leaving office earlier this year and listening to many of my constituents, I kept hearing how much they wanted someone to represent them at the county level. So, I decided that the time was right to seek Gwinnett's highest office, the County Commission Chair. While in the legislature for the last 16 years, I was able to gain the skills and experience needed to serve an area with needs as diverse and important as Gwinnett's are.
I understand that a one-size-fits-all solution won't always work and how important it is to listen to the voices of those that I represent. Too many politicians have forgotten that this is the purpose of government. When I was in the state legislature, my motto was ""making your voice count."" That was my top priority at all times. It was what I fought to do every single day and, when I'm elected, it's what I promise to continue doing.
Our county needs someone who is willing to stand up and fight for their voices. Together, we can ensure that our county expands public transportation and we can ensure that we do not discriminate against members of the LGBTQ+ and minority communities that make up our diverse county of over 120 spoken languages. We can build affordable housing and expand access to education and parks. We can build a county wide public wifi network so that small and service businesses do not have to worry about the cost of providing that service to their customers and so low income families don't have to send their kids to Starbucks and McDonald's to do their homework. We don't have to choose between safe streets and having to worry about ""driving while brown"". We can enact the progressive and forward-looking vision that Gwinnett needs. This is the campaign where we decide to take up the mantle and become the county that leads the nation.
Let me be very clear: this is not my campaign, this is our campaign. This is our campaign for our future. This is our campaign for our children's future. This is our campaign for Gwinnett's future. I am asking for your vote and your support. In return, I promise that I will fight for you every day so what Gwinnett is a place we are all proud to call home.
I hope you join us as we build a bridge to that future, together, because now my goal is not to just represent a singular and particular district in Gwinnett, but the entirety of the county overall. If you want to join this fight please to my website – curtforgwinnett.com and sign up be a part of building that bridge."

Last November, a North Carolina Republican candidate was involved in an illegal voting fraud scheme involving more than 1,000 absentee ballots, leaving the state's congressional delegation still undecided. Americans are questioning the integrity of our voting system as this controversy made its way up the national headlines. However, there is one question that needs to be asked about our local voting system in Georgia: will newer voting machines (and training) reduce the voting ""schemes"" and create more democratic elections?
Georgia must adopt a new voting system that is both easier and safer than the current one. HB- 316, a bill proposed by state Rep. Barry Fleming, will authorize the $150 million purchase of new digital voting machines and training across all counties in Georgia, and it's currently being discussed within House Governmental Affairs Committee. The machines will be touch screen (favored by the Republicans) and will print receipts.
On the other hand, Democrats, such as former Gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams, have been urging a hand ballot. Although the machines will be more convenient, she argues that ""The bill makes a lot of changes that won't stop the cycle of suppression and in fact could make it even worse – we'll still see mass purging and hours-long lines, along with other major problems…"" Her point is that it isn't just the machines that were flawed—the entire system needs to be reassessed. Even if this bill had passed prior to the election, there still would have been tens of thousands of people who were purged from the rolls.
There are certainly benefits to a more technologically-advanced voting system, for which votes can be easily recorded and accessible for the elderly. However, becoming dependent these systems can easily lead to malfunctions, ""wiping out"" of information, and other difficulties that, as Abrams argues, exacerbate the situation."

The March referendum is quickly approaching, and the special election will decide whether or not transit will be expanded in Gwinnett. Rosetta Stone Communications recently conducted a poll that truly highlights how much work is set out for us if we want to approve the transit referendum.
Asking 960 local Gwinnettians who ""routinely voted in general elections,"" the poll discovered that 48 percent of respondents opposed the referendum, and another 10.5 percent said they were undecided. That means that just over 40 percent of people are in favor of the referendum passing. Keep in mind that at least 50 percent plus one vote is needed in order for any referendum to be passed. While these poll projections were not entirely representative of the population (65 percent of surveyors were white and 90 percent were over the age of 40), there is still a point to be made about the results.
It should be noted that Rosetta Stone Communications is a right-leaning organization and may have a ""house bias,"" meaning that their poll results tend to skew towards the outcome desired by conservatives. Regardless, this poll of likely voters gives us a glimpse of what will happen if there is low turnout, which is what they are assuming there will be. If it's as low as they are expecting it to be in the poll, then the referendum will more than likely fail. This is why it's so important for us to all get out and vote. We know from other polls that Gwinnettians as a whole want an expansion of public transit, but we have to actually vote for it to make it effective across our prospering county.
First, we will need the youth and minorities to come out to the polls. These groups are likely to favor passing the transit referendum, so it is vital to have as many supporters at the ballots. Though 48 percent opposed the referendum in the poll findings, the special election results will be different if the demographics alter to include younger voters as well as voters from minority communities.
Second, we will need as many voters to come out, period. This includes recently registered voters, regular voters, and dormant voters. The more Gwinnett residents that find their way to the polls, the more the election will actually represent our opinion on the referendum regardless of the outcome. Special elections do not have as high of a turnout as general elections, which means that every vote counts. In fact, the last special election in 2015 concerning the SPLOST referendum only garnered 25,222 votes across all of Gwinnett County. Consequently, every vote has more ""swaying power,"" so we need all the votes we can possibly get.
Third, all of us must to do our part so that we can promote the special election. We can actively promote on our social media outlets, discuss the issue everywhere we go from the workplace to the coffeeshop, encourage your friends and neighbors to vote on March 19th, and even volunteer with advocate groups. Former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams publicly announced her support for Gwinnett's transit referendum, and she continues to challenge voter suppression with her new voting rights group Fair Fight Georgia. Go Gwinnett is another prominent advocacy group urging that now is the time to get on board with transit. Like Abrams, we must vocalize our support for transit expansion as it is an issue that concerns our everyday productivity, because let us be real for just a moment (who actually likes sitting in traffic)?

The night of the 2017 election when Ralph Northam was elected Governor of Virginia, he contended, ""Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry and to end the politics that have torn this country apart. It's going to take a 'doctor' to heal our differences."" A recent racist photograph from Governor Northam's medical yearbook page, however, has recently resurfaced and speaks otherwise. The photograph shows a man in a KKK costume and another, allegedly Northam, in blackface.
Governor Northam continues to deny that he is the man in blackface. He has given a length of excuses, including the one he gave during the Richmond news conference last weekend. He claimed that he would ""remember"" taking the picture because he remembered the time he dressed as Michael Jackson for a dance contest and wore blackface, which he did by wearing shoe polish to darken his face. Once and for all - it's never okay to wear blackface, not now, not in medical school, not ever. I fail to see why we keep rehashing this debate—there isn't a debate, it's simply wrong. Further, recounting another time he wore blackface to dismiss wearing blackface is the worst explanation he could have given. In 1984, I too was a Michael Jackson fan. I owned a ""Beat It"" jacket, glove, and the ""parachute"" pants that I would wear as I tried moonwalking like Michael Jackson. However, the key difference between the Governor and I was the blackface, and I never even thought about it, because it's just common sense and decency not to do that.
There have been widespread calls for his resignation, including from within the Democratic Party, but Governor Northam remains resolute and refuses to take responsibility for the scandal. National Democrats have firmly asserted that they cannot support a figure associated with signs of bigotry and racism. Furthermore, this controversy could affect the next two years he has left in office, as well as the 2021 Virginia Governor's race. Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, as well as Representative Robert Scott, revealed in a statement, ""We no longer believe he can effectively serve as the governor of Virginia and that he must resign,"" and they are absolutely right.
Despite the political turmoil that he has surged in Virginia, Governor Northam refuses to resign. He seems to be steering toward the idea of casting his naivety as a part of the past. However, this discussion should not and cannot be a ""teachable moment"" for the Governor of Virginia because he fails to assume responsibility for his actions. Rather, this controversy highlights a ""Faulkner moment"" as the author's quote goes, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past."" This photograph is a part of someone's embarrassing and shameful present where he refuses to take responsibility for it. You don't get to use something as a ""teachable moment"" from your past when you continue to refuse responsibility for it. We are living in a time where we must criticize those government officials and Presidents who won't take responsibility for anything. How can he hope to heal America in the future when it was, he who damaged it in the past? Think about this question, and ponder because we cannot let elected officials and politicians get away with deplorable actions simply because they happened in the past.
This is not a debate about redemption for his past because Governor Northam continues to obfuscate and deny responsibility. He should resign immediately, and then the ""healing"" can finally begin."

Thanks to President Trump and Congressional Republicans, we were subjected to the longest government shutdown in American history. Though it is temporarily over, almost every American government worker must wait on their much-needed paycheck, the federal contractor who will never get paid, the business traveler who waited in never ending airport security lines, the farmer who waited for government-mandated harvest prices to sell crops was affected by this prolonged impasse.
President Trump's motivation for prolonging the shutdown is clear as he demanded over $5 billion of funding to build the infamous wall along the US-Mexico border. Not only is his project not feasible, since neither Congress nor the Mexican government are on board, but also impractical as the annual budget resolution would need to be amended solely for the wall. During the shutdown, Republicans such as Sen. Lisa Murkowski expressed skepticism in negotiation claiming, ""If there is something of substance that comes with his wall request, [Democrats] are willing to listen. But you can't keep the government shut down while we work on it."" There seems to be room for negotiation now that the government has temporarily reopened, and the House and Senate have already begun to work together on a border security package and avoid another shutdown. President Trump, however, still threatens to declare a ""national emergency"" in order to move funds toward building his border wall, which would be an unprecedented and a dangerous move.
Economists have suggested that the recent government shutdown may have diminished business and consumer confidence enough to have negative long-lasting effects, even raising the risk of a recession. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the shutdown cost $11 billion, nearly double what President Trump was demanding for his vanity wall. The small businesses that surround government buildings lost customers and revenue. 800,000 federal employees went without their paychecks for nearly a month. They were struggling to pay their rent, afford gas, and even buy food. What was the Trump Administration's advice to them? Wilbur Ross, the billionaire Secretary of Commerce, suggested they take out loans and ""didn't quite understand"" why some of these workers were forced to visit food pantries. Kevin Hassett, a White House economic adviser, said that the workers were ""better off"" because the shutdown was like a vacation. This shutdown revealed the true nature of President Trump and his cohort. They're rich, calloused, and out of touch with America. They're modern day robber barons, profiting off of the pain they inflict on the American people. They aren't Making America Great Again, they're making themselves rich again."

We're back in election season, but this time it's a transit referendum regarding an expansion of public transportation in Gwinnett—something that we desperately need to pass. On March 19th, Gwinnett County will be holding a vote to decide on raising the sales tax by one percentage point in order to help fund an expansion of public transportation. This extra revenue raised will go to the county and be under local control. If the referendum passes, Gwinnett will join 12 other metro-area counties that have already agreed to become what will be known as ""The ATL."" This plan would expand our access to light and heavy rail, buses, express lanes, and more. This is a great opportunity for Gwinnett to take several giant steps forward and finally have world-class public transportation.
An expansion of our public transportation would provide some much-needed relief to Gwinnett's already crowded roads. It's no secret that our traffic is some of the worst in the state. However, given our population growth, it will only get worse—unless we expand public transit. Standard and Rapid Transit Buses (RBT) would help decrease the number of vehicles on the road; light and heavy rail would take many cars off the road all together. Not only would this cut down on commute times, but it would also be good for the environment. There would simply be fewer greenhouse gases emitted into the air.
Better public transit means a better economy and a better quality of life. With its expansion, public transportation would lead to more jobs and more labor mobility. Many people in Gwinnett do not own a car or other form of transportation. This is especially true for the elderly, who sometimes simply can't drive. An expansion of public transportation would allow those in our county who otherwise wouldn't be able to travel, to get around and participate in our local economy and potentially live more fulfilling lives. People could commute to their job in Atlanta or Gwinnett, even if they don't have a car. It would also save many people some much-needed gas money, since they wouldn't have to drive to work every day.

On November 6th, the election came and brought with it both victory and defeat. Many of us celebrated as numerous state legislature seats—that were once reliably Republican—flipped to the Democrats. We also had to deal with the loss of Stacey Abrams, Sarah Riggs Amico, Charlie Bailey, and almost all the other statewide Democrats who came so close to winning, but fell just short. However, two statewide races still remain undecided until December 4th and they could not be more important. John Barrow forced a runoff in his bid to become Secretary of State and Lindy Miller did the same in her race for Public Service Commission.
The Public Service Commission (PSC) is a position that doesn't get nearly the level of attention that it deserves. Of all the races that affect the day-to-day lives of hardworking Georgians, this one may be the biggest. The PSC sets the energy rates for Georgia Power, which is the largest electricity provider in the state, serving over 2.4 million Georgians. They also play a regulatory role over some aspects of gas and telecommunications. Every single time you turn on your light or you turn on a gas-powered stove, you are feeling the effect of the PSC. One of the hot issues during the race was the construction of Plant Vogtle, a nuclear power plant located near Augusta. The plant rose in prominence as a result of its proclivity to expand its budget—wasting our taxpayer dollars—and miss its deadlines. Because of this, Lindy Miller wants the investors of this plant, not the taxpayers, to pay for the project if it continues. Her opponent, Chuck Eaton, continues to rubber stamp Plant Vogtle and refuses to take any real action to hold them accountable. He, like many of the current commissioners, act as a rubber stamp for groups that have high-dollar donations waiting for his vote. Lindy Miller is a qualified, hardworking candidate who supports green energy and lower power bills and correctly believes that our best interests are not currently being served.
The other ongoing race is for the Secretary of State, an office which has grown considerably in infamy over the last few months. John Barrow, a former U.S. Congressman, is in a runoff with Brad Raffensperger for the position. The importance of this race cannot be overstated. The reason that many of the statewide Democrats lost was because the Secretary of State worked as hard as he could to ensure that minorities and likely-Democrats could not vote. Since 2012, Secretary of State Brian Kemp purged over 1 million voters from the rolls. He also worked to make it difficult to register to vote by designing a confusing process and enforced an ""exact match"" system. This system was designed to prevent minorities from voting because if a name had any kind of discrepancy between the ballot and when the individual registered, it would be thrown out. This disproportionately affected minorities and young people—the former use accents in their name at a higher rate; the latter often have hyphenated last names. Leaving off or adding either of these, a hyphen or an accent, would ensure that you could not vote. As Secretary of State, John Barrow would reject this archaic and anti-democratic system. He is also in favor of automatic voter registration at the age of 18 and ensuring that the voting machines are up to date and enough of them to adequately serve the community."

The 2018 election was by far the most important midterm election we've ever seen, and it came with many victories for the Democratic Party. While at the national level the obvious victories for Democrats were taking back the US House and winning 7 Governorships and over 330 state legislative seats nationwide, the most amazing thing was to see how Gwinnett switched from Red to Blue skipping over ""Purple"" completely in this election.
First, I would like to congratulate all the Democratic candidates who ran, including Ben Ku and Marlene Fosque, who became the first Democrats elected to the Gwinnett County Commission since 1988, Everton Blair, Jr., the second Democrat on the Gwinnett County School Board, State Senators-Elect Sally Harrell and Zahra Karinshak, as well as newly elected State House members Sally Hutchinson, Jasmine Clark, Beth Moore, and Greg Kennard. Even our candidates that did not win this election cycle made huge progress turning their districts bluer than they've ever been. Thank you to Wandy Taylor, Aisha Yaqoob, Andrea Polk Stephenson, Cheryle Moses, and Carolyn Bordeaux, who came within 419 votes of defeating a 4-term GOP congressman and is going to a recount. I know they all have bright futures in Gwinnett politics. Even though Stacy Abrams has stopped her campaign, I know she will be back in 2020 and we all need to be there to help her across the finish line when she makes that decision. I ran twice before winning my first race. All those who ran should consider that next run in 2020. The county's needs you.
Gwinnett is now a blue county, which is an outstanding feat, but this didn't happen magically and if we want to continue this trend we have several goals ahead of us. To begin, we can now move forward on our agenda regarding mass transit and public education. Both of these issues will require bipartisanship for us to work in the interest of all Gwinnettians. Having a strong blue hold will be an immense advantage in the next two years. It means that there will be a real seat at the table for those looking to represent the interests of Gwinnett residents and citizens long ignored by our local officials. The first step we can take is showing up to the ballots for the runoff election this December 4th. Candidates like John Barrow and Lindy Miller will need all our support to be elected. In 2014, Gwinnett was 43% blue, but we have successfully risen to 54% overall looking at county wide votes in statewide races. These points go a long way, and hopefully with diligent work these next years we can make them even higher. BUT they won't magically stay that way. We have to work on turnout for the December 4th referendum and then turn around and work on the March transit referendum. If Democrats can stay active, recruit candidates in the 2019 municipal races, and continue the work done by Stacy Abrams and others, we can assure that we are part of making this state Blue in the race for President in 2020 and in races to defend our gains and pick up additional seats here in Gwinnett.
Although my term comes to a close this January, I will still be working alongside candidates to help them in the runoffs. I encourage you all to meet me and my new successor, Sen. Sheikh Rahman. We should celebrate our victories and certainly learn from the losses and close calls, but we can't stop working to make sure everyone's vote counts in Gwinnett and everyone's voice is heard. This runoff is too important to not get involved with it. The gubernatorial race was unfairly impacted by a Secretary of State who had his interests in mind, not the people's. We need to make sure that in future races, the Secretary of State is someone who wants people to vote, who wants everyone's voice to be heard. We need to make sure that Republican Brian Kemp's replacement is Democrat John Barrow. We need to elect Lindy Miller to the Public Service Commission because, unlike Chuck Eaton, she'll look out for your interests, not those of the energy companies. She will make sure to keep energy prices low, because to her, it's your bottom line that matters, not the energy companies."

On the wide spectrum of controversies in today's headlines, the legalization of marijuana is one that may significantly affect the midterm elections. Despite the fact that, in recent years, states as a whole have become more accepting of marijuana's health benefits, restrictive statutes, especially here in Georgia, remain in place. Given that marijuana legalization is such a politically divisive issue, there is no doubt that the midterm election results will decisively shape future policies in expansion.
Currently, Georgia has a study committee searching for ways to legally make CBD oil, but they have yet to offer any suggestions on how this could be properly maintained and controlled. A big hurdle in this ongoing process is that the committee will only consist of Republicans, since Rep. Allen Peake and I will no longer be in office after this year. Just a few months ago, Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 65 into effect, which added PTSD and intractable pain to the list of conditions eligible for treatment by CBD oil. However, House Bill 645, which would have legalized the harvesting and distribution of CBD oil, did not pass. This is a major problem because the existing ordinance only addresses the possession of marijuana but does not touch on getting access to it. This leaves Georgia in a state of limbo, where possession of CBD oil can be legal, but it is still illegal to domestically produce it, or import it from other states. The state will need new advocates on the committee to effectively and efficiently expand the bill so that those in need can legally have access to medical marijuana.
Federal law has not yet legalized marijuana, and its jurisdiction will always trump the state law. However, every election brings the opportunity to expand the legalization of marijuana until it can be adopted federally. In fact, there are seven such measures across several states, such as Michigan and Missouri, on which voters can decide. Georgia's ballot does not contain any laws on medical marijuana this time around. However, the newly elected candidates, especially the governor, will be pivotal in paving the way toward expansion."

As the midterm elections approach, it is of the utmost importance that all Georgians understand—and exercise—their right to vote. Brian Kemp, Georgia's current Secretary of State, has engaged in voter suppression for years by purging voter files. This effort to disenfranchise voters is a hyper-partisan and cynical attempt by Kemp and other Republicans to hold political power by stopping Georgians from voting who do not support their narrow agenda rather than by appealing to the diverse population that makes up Georgia with programs and policies that serve all Georgians well.
While many Georgians may not be aware of how greatly voter suppression is impacting our community, Kemp has, throughout his tenure, engaged in excessive voter registration purges at a rate higher than almost any other state except Kansas. Kemp recently was involved in efforts to eliminate almost all the voting places in a rural majority African American county (Randolph County) in Southwest Georgia. He's been so effective that our state has recently been in the national news. Kemp put over 53,000 voter registration forms on hold because they do not meet his office's strict ""exact match"" standards that tend to affect people with hyphenated last names or unusually spelled names. Over 70% of these applications appear to be African-American. More specifically, Gwinnett County has been rejecting absentee ballots and ballot requests at a rate four times higher than the state and has the highest percentage of these ""on hold"" voter registrations of any county in Georgia. It's particularly discriminatory against Asian-American voters, who are being rejected at the highest rate of all. Given Gwinnett is the most diverse county in the state and I represent the 3rd most diverse State Senate district in the nation, with over 120 languages spoken here, it's clear that Kemp's efforts are almost exclusively targeting minority voters to help his own standing in the elections. Given his now infamous anti-immigrant primary commercials, it's no wonder Kemp is doing this, but it's also un-American.
Kemp notoriously advocates for conservatives to ""Stand Your Ground"" in regards to gun laws, but in reality, it is the voters that need to stand our ground against corrupt voter suppression schemes. We need to stand our ground and demand the right to vote. We need to stand our ground and demand that the rights of women and the LGBTQ+ community are protected. We need to stand our ground and demand quality healthcare and education. We need to stand our ground and demand better public transportation and an economy that works for all Georgians.
Given the rampant voter suppression, it's imperative to understand the various ways to exercise our right to vote. You can still vote even if your absentee ballot or application has been rejected. Please remind everyone on social media, at work, our places of worship, in our neighborhoods and communities, and even in our own families, that we have to stand our ground and vote. Here's what you need to do:
1. Go to mvp.sos.ga.gov to check your voting registration status, find your polling location, check your mail-in application and ballot status for absentee ballots, and see sample ballots.
2. If you wish to mail an absentee ballot,
a. Request one from your county's Board of Elections
b. Once you've received it, fill it out and submit it (for Gwinnett County, the address is 75 Langley Drive, Lawrenceville, GA)
c. After submitting your ballot, call your county registrar's office immediately to verify that your vote was counted
d. November 2nd is the last day for a registrar to issue or mail absentee ballots
3. If you wish to participate in advanced (absentee in-person) voting
a. Be sure to take your absentee ballot with you
b. Voting begins on October 15th
4. If your absentee ballot or application was denied
a. Vote in person and vote early
b. Bring a photo ID that shows proof of citizenship"

It would include a high-rise, 250-room hotel, 352 single-family apartments, 40 condominiums, 169,739 square feet of retail space and 91,200 square feet of office space.
An earlier version of the plan included a pedestrian bridge over Ivy Creek Greenway, but that was scrapped due to environmental concerns.
It was replaced with a more modest trail and bridge system that would still let people from the development walk to Mall of Georgia.

June 30, 2020
After lawmakers reconvened from the pandemic-interrupted session, the 2020 Legislative Session concluded on Friday, June 26 as lawmakers maximized the remaining 11 days prioritizing legislation to pass and send to the Governor's desk. Highlighted below are some key takeaways.
$25.9 Billion Fiscal 2021 State Budget
Lawmakers had the pressing task of passing an adjusted budget after the pandemic brought revenue losses across all departments. Originally projected to cut 14% across the board, the general assembly was able to reduce the cuts to 10% and avoid furloughs thanks to Governor Kemp's decision to tap into the state's reserve funds. Furthermore, lawmakers voted to pass 10% cuts to salaries of legislators and a 14% cut for the Lt. Governor.
Historic Hate Crimes Legislation Signed into Law
After stalling in the Senate for over a year, recent events of racial injustice spurred renewed call-to-action on the passage of a comprehensive hate crimes law. The Senate passed HB 426 by substitute on a widely bipartisan basis after Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan added data reporting measures to the bill. The Governor signed the bill into law on Friday, June 26. Anyone who is convicted of a crime based on race, gender, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, or mental or physical disability will face harsher penalties.
Safe Harbor Legislation Passes
As businesses adjust their operations to keep business open during the COVID-19 pandemic, SB 359 would protect them from frivolous lawsuits if an employee or customer contracts COVID-19 except in the event of ""gross negligence, willful and wanton misconduct, reckless infliction of harm, or intentional infliction of harm."" There is a sunset provision, if signed, for July 14, 2021. The House and Senate passed the measure largely along party lines.
Taxes
Among several tax-related bills that were up for debate, HB 1035, which would have cut every Georgia tax credit and exemption by 10 percent, did not pass in the Senate. House Bill 105, which sets a 50 cents per ride tax rate for rideshares, taxis, and limos along with a 25 cents fee for pooled rideshare rides, passed the General Assembly. Lastly, HB 846, which gives tax credits to businesses that make personal protective equipment (PPE), also passed the Senate.
The Governor has 40 days from the end of session to decide which bills he will sign or veto. If he does not veto within 40 days, the bills become law on their effective date, commonly July 1.
