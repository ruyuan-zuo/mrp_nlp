Larry Hogan said the state would be moving into stage three of its reopening, County Executive Barry Glassman said the plan for Harford County was to follow suit.
""Harford County's metrics remain low, and we will continue to safely and quickly reopen to the extent permitted by Gov. Hogan effective at 5 p.m. Friday, Sept. 4, 2020,"" Glassman said in a statement Tuesday night.
Harford County has 2,500 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and 67 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
Masks are still required in retail establishments, on public transit and in situations where people cannot maintain 6 feet of physical distance.

1,/maryland/belair/mail-voting-maryland-deadlines-how-get-ballot,2020-08-26T18:27:09Z,"Mail-In Voting In Maryland: Deadlines, How To...",0,7,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — More than 500,000 mail-in ballots went uncounted during the 2020 primary season nationwide, many of them because they were deemed incomplete or because they arrived too late.
In Maryland, state election officials said nearly 35,000 ballots were rejected during the primary.
Of those, authorities said more than 30,000 ballots were received late and more than 3,000 did not have signatures.
The issue could grow: A record number of voters may stay away from traditional polling places for the Nov. 3 general election because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead cast their ballots by mail.
To help ensure your vote is among those tallied in Maryland, follow this checklist:
Note: Due to a change in law, the Maryland Board of Elections must use the terms ""mail-in ballot"" and ""mail-in voting"" rather than absentee ballot or absentee voting.
With guidelines changing in many states, more than 80 percent of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election, by far the most in U.S. history.
That's a result of 20 states loosening vote-by-mail laws this year due to the pandemic. As of Aug. 25, data from The Washington Post indicates 100 million people will be eligible to vote by mail either with no ""excuse"" or citing fears of the coronavirus as a reason. Among them, 51 million people will be automatically sent a ballot in the mail and 44 million people sent an application for a mail-in ballot.
Only six states still require a valid excuse other than coronavirus fears to vote by mail. Five states had already conducted elections solely by mail even before the pandemic.
Will your vote count?
In the primary election, a study by the Post showed 534,731 ballots were nixed in 23 states, and NPR found even more — 558,032 in 30 states — in a similar study. In New York City alone, more than 84,000 mail-in ballots were tossed and lawsuits were filed over the legitimacy of the outcomes of some close races.
Millions of people will cast their ballots by mail for the first time in the 2020 general election. Pew Research numbers show the number of people who vote by mail had already been on a sharp increase for years. In 2016, more than 20 percent of voters nationwide voted by mail, a total of about 27 million.
Of the 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, officials found 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people, according to Electronic Registration Information Center data analyzed by the Post. That equates to a 0.0025 percent fraud rate. The Brennan Center for Justice has described vote-by-mail fraud as ""infinitesimally small.""
Why are people concerned about a legitimate election with so few documented cases of actual fraud?
Partly, it's problems with the U.S. Postal Service. But equally troublesome are problems that exposed themselves during the primaries. The Post data shows more ballots were rejected in 23 states than the number of absentee ballot rejections reported in the 2016 general election nationwide, in large part because of mistakes in filling out the ballots.
That means a lot more opportunities for inexperienced mail-in voters to make mistakes — which Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says could pose a significant problem in the rejection rate come November.
""Experience matters,"" Smith told the Post. ""If you lack experience voting by mail, the odds of you casting a ballot that doesn't count will go up.""
To make sure your ballot is counted:
Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said if the election between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is close, the mail-in ballots will create ""a mess.""
""The two campaigns will be arguing over nonconforming ballots, which is going to run up against voters' beliefs in fair play,"" Stewart told the Post.
There's also growing concern over the governmental entity tasked with handling the influx of mail-in ballots.
The Postal Service has come under fire for increasingly slow service, mail backlogs and planned changes that some have feared will have an effect on their ability to handle the expected massive increase of mail-in ballots this year.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told senators on Capitol Hill in recent testimony he was unaware of certain changes at the Postal Service until they caused a public uproar. But he also said there are no plans to restore mailboxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed. His testimony raised fresh questions about how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of ballots for the November election.
In Maryland, vote-by-mail drop boxes will be installed so voters can avoid the lines at the polls and not have to worry about Postal Service issues. At least 200 drop boxes will be open until 8 p.m. on Nov. 3.

2,/maryland/belair/rooftop-dining-area-hospital-expansion-proposed-bel-air,2020-07-09T12:44:11Z,"Rooftop Dining Area, Hospital Expansion...",0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — Three proposed developments in town were approved Thursday night in Bel Air. Among them were changes at the Main Street Tower and Upper Chesapeake Medical Center.
The Main Street Tower was granted permission for its rooftop deck to be used for outdoor dining. The proposal calls for a 1,658-square-foot outdoor dining area.
In September 2019, owner Renato Buontempo appeared before the Bel Air Planning Commission about a 2,311-square-foot outdoor dining area on the rooftop deck.
At that time, the Tower received authorization to update a railing and install a sound wall over the winter. The architect who presented the proposal described it as ""phase one"" of the deck project, for which he said planning began in early 2019. Buontempo and his architect were told they would need to come back to the board with a site plan outlining proposed use of the deck. The planning commission also stipulated that permits would be required for the deck, roof rails and outdoor dining.
At Thursday's hearing, the commission approved the site plan and special development request.
One other proposal before the commission was for an 11,000-square-foot addition to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center at 500 Upper Chesapeake Drive. The expansion would be on the support services part of the hospital. A site plan, landscape plan and special development request were approved.
Plans also got the green light for additions to the previously approved ambulatory surgical center at 515 South Tollgate Road. They include a 16,061-square-foot addition and 2,299-square-foot addition to the first floor, according to the planning commission. The surgical center will offer surgery in a less costly setting than a hospital and is designed to meet the needs of the community for more inpatient and outpatient beds with the future closure of Harford Memorial Hospital, Upper Chesapeake's representative said at previous hearing in November 2018 about the project."

4,/maryland/belair/census-response-harford-county-2nd-highest-maryland,2020-06-27T13:31:00Z,How Much Of Harford County Has Responded To Census,0,1,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"HARFORD COUNTY, MD — Nearly two out of every five U.S. households nationwide have yet to respond to the U.S. Census, stoking fears that billions of federal dollars could be left on the table — dollars that fund crucial services including during the pandemic. Harford County has the third-highest response rate to the U.S. Census in Maryland.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's self-response map, 73.7 households in Harford County have responded to this year's census either online, by phone or by mail.
Nationally, about 61.5 percent of households have responded as of June 26; and in Maryland, 65.7 percent have responded to the census.
This means more than three out of every 10 households in Maryland have not yet been counted.
Here are the counties with the highest response rates in Maryland as of June 26:
People can respond to the census through Oct. 31 online, by phone or by mail.
The purpose of the once-each-decade count is to help determine where $1.5 trillion in federal funding goes and how many congressional seats each state gets.
If 20 percent of the population in Harford County does not get counted in 2020, government officials say the county would lose $93 million in federal funding per year.
The new coronavirus erupted just as the 2020 census was getting underway.
In the wake of mass layoffs and unprecedented economic damage, studies are projecting that more than 4 million people could be undercounted this year.
Should these households not respond, billions of dollars that fund crucial services before, during and after the coronavirus pandemic will be lost. Services include hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and dozens more.
Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.
Both the National Urban League and the NALEO Educational Fund have sounded the alarm that communities with large concentrations of black and Hispanic residents are trailing the rest of the nation in answering the 2020 questionnaire, the Associated Press reported.
A more detailed analysis of response rates in late May and early June conducted by the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center showed that neighborhoods with concentrations of black residents had a self-response rate of 51 percent, compared with 53.8 percent for Hispanic-concentrated neighborhoods and 65.5 percent for white-dominant neighborhoods.
These populations are also among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Young people and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, according to one study. So are women and people of color, Department of Labor data says.
This is causing outreach challenges for both the Census Bureau and organizations providing services to impacted communities.
The Census Bureau suspended field operations in March, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This also included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
The Census Bureau told the Associated Press that it had finished dropping off questionnaire forms in June to almost the 6.8 million mostly rural households across the country.
Organizations nationwide have put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media and telephone calls.
Because of the pandemic, the bureau pushed back the deadline for finishing the 2020 census from the end of July to the end of October, and it asked Congress for a delay in handing over apportionment and redistricting numbers.
Census officials have encouraged Americans to respond to the decennial survey online, a first for the census.
In a move designed to cut costs and keep up with digital lifestyles, the census questionnaire is available at my2020census.gov. Americans can access the online questionnaire by using a 12-digit ID code included with their census invitation sent by mail.

The National Association of Counties (NACo) has recognized Harford County in 2020 with two awards for innovative and effective county government programs. The county was honored with Achievement Awards for its Halloween costume workshop for children who use wheelchairs and the anti-drug Pledge Program for youth, presented in partnership with the Harford County Sheriff's Office.
The Glassman administration has earned a total of eleven NACo awards over the past five years.
""I would like to thank our community partners and sponsors, and our creative county employees, for these outstanding programs,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""Together we were able to help children learn early on about the dangers of drugs and alcohol and give all kids a chance to share in the joys of childhood.""
Halloween Costume Workshop
For some children who use a wheelchair, dressing up in a costume and trick-or-treating in their neighborhood can be a challenge. Traditional Halloween costumes often don't fit and the physical inaccessibility of neighborhoods leaves many children with disabilities home on that magical night. Imagine a place where every child who uses a wheelchair can not only trick or treat with their siblings and peers, but be the star of the evening in a unique costume designed specifically for them. In most communities around the country, this does not exist. In Harford County, Maryland it does.
Rachel Harbin in the Harford County Department of Community Services developed the region's first Wheelchair Costume Workshop, held at Ripken Stadium in October 2019. Over two days, more than 100 community volunteers designed, built and painted completely original costumes that fit securely on 12 children's wheelchairs. Once the costumes were fitted, the children joined over 300 children of all abilities for inclusive trick-or-treating at the stadium, providing an important example to the community that ALL children should be able to have fun, play with their peers, and enjoy Halloween! The Wheelchair Costume Workshop is an outstanding example of a public-private partnership—with over 30 local businesses and community organizations coming together to provide volunteers, donate building materials, and sponsor trick or treat stations.
Pledge Program
The Pledge Program was developed by Tara Lathrop in Harford County government's Office of Drug Control Policy and by the Harford County Sheriff's Office. The program for children ages 8 to 11 years old educates young people before they are exposed to substances and trains them to use refusal skills to resist drugs and alcohol. The interactive program incorporates guest speakers, including a doctor, an individual in recovery, and a parent who has lost a child to drug use. Children also have the opportunity to participate in role play scenarios with local high school theater students to experience mock-peer pressure and practice refusal skills. Another important component of the Pledge Program is the participation of parents and guardians. Parents and caregivers are provided topics to discuss with youth to continue the conversation at home and encourage discussion among family members. Since its inception in January 2019, the Pledge Program has partnered with five Harford County elementary schools with a total of 153 participants. Each participant received training and information that help expand their understanding of drugs and drug use in order to make positive and healthy choices in the future.
""Our community has been rocked by addiction and the overwhelming loss of life to opioid overdoses,"" Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said. ""It isn't enough to lock up dealers, we must find a way to prevent the overdoses from occurring. When Sgt. Aaron Penman approached me with the idea of the Pledge Program, it was an easy 'yes' from me. We know that early intervention is the key to preventing drug use and this program offers us one more tool to prevention and reaching our most vulnerable population, our children. I am exceedingly proud of this program, our partnerships to get this accomplished, and for the young people who are so willing to participate and learn."""

It is one of 17 MVA offices that will open following the months-long closure due to the coronavirus.
Appointments are required to go to the MVA branches that are open to minimize the amount of people in the building at one time.
Those who had to reschedule appointments that had been canceled due to the closure are prioritized first. By order of the governor, the MVA shut down all branches to in-person services March 20. Although the governor enabled these to be extended due to the state of emergency, these cases are prioritized by the MVA first.
Gov. Larry Hogan ordered extensions for driver's licenses, ID cards, permits and registrations that expire March 12 through the state of emergency, and they will not expire until 30 days after the state of emergency is lifted. Currently the state of emergency remains in effect in Maryland.
These services will be available by making an appointment online: learner's permits, commercial driving tests, non-commercial driving tests, driver's license and identification card renewal and title work.
Here are the locations that will open Monday, June 8:
New requirements will be in place at the entryway, in the office itself and at each work station.
Before both customers and employees enter, they must participate in a brief health screening.
Plexiglass dividers will separate work stations inside the MVA office.

In the building, social distancing markers will indicate where people should stand to allow an adequate amount of space between one another.

""We are making the necessary adjustments to our procedures to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and customers,"" MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer said in a statement.
""We appreciate our customers' patience during the closure and look forward to providing premier customer service whether you complete a transaction through our eStore, kiosks, mail-in processes or in person at our branch offices,"" Nizer said.
People can renew registrations, change their address, make insurance compliance payments and get information on flag fees online at mva.maryland.gov.
Since it closed its offices in late March, the MVA reports it has processed more than 740,000 transactions online.

The grants are being offered to business owners who run small operations that do not meet the standards for either the county's $7,500 business grant or the $2,500 farm grant program. Larger businesses may apply for the $5,000 grant program but city officials are attempting to reserve funds for small businesses.

The county received 700 applications for the two previous grant programs and expect to be sending payments out to 150-200 applicants per week until all qualified applicants have been paid, Mumby wrote.
Mumby note that County Executive Barry Glassman's goal with all of these programs is to get help to the county's business community as soon as possible. There are no requirements for the minimum number of employees to qualify for the grant program.

The executive order takes effect at 5 p.m. Friday, May 29, concurrent with the order Gov. Larry Hogan issued permitting restaurants and bars to serve patrons outside.
In announcing that outdoor dining would be allowed once again in Maryland, the governor called upon the leaders of local jurisdictions to work with businesses to reopen.
""We love the idea of closing streets for outside seating in Little Italy and Fells Point in Baltimore City, on West Street and Main Street in Annapolis, on Bethesda Row and in other towns across the state,"" Hogan said during a news conference Wednesday where he announced the relaxation of requirements. Hogan said he was ""strongly encouraging local leaders to find innovative ways to help support our restaurant businesses.""
The executive order that Glassman signed Thursday gives restaurants more space in their parking lots for outside dining by waiving several provisions of Harford County code, including those that have to do with off-street parking requirements, temporary uses, setbacks, seating capacity, outdoor displays, premise signage and outdoor storage.
""This action will make it easier for restaurants to offer outside dining, similar to my prior Executive Order facilitating outdoor retail sales,"" Glassman said in a statement. ""As with each step in reopening, everyone must follow required safety precautions so we can continue moving forward together.""

Hogan also said restaurants should offer disposable, single-use menus or sanitize reusable menus between each seating, screen staff through daily temperature checks and train staff members in current COVID-19 guidelines.
The new outdoor dining guidance applies to restaurants and bars as well as social and fraternal clubs, including American Legion posts, VFW posts and Elks Clubs.

Larry Hogan announced his plan to lift the stay-at-home order at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland, he followed by saying local leaders had the capacity to determine whether that was appropriate for their jurisdictions. County Executive Barry Glassman plans for Harford County to fall into alignment with the governor's orders.
""I am pleased to announce that in consultation with our health officer, Harford County will reopen on Friday at 5 p.m. as outlined in Gov. Hogan's Safer at Home advisory,"" Glassman said in a statement Thursday. ""At the same time, all citizens should continue to follow required social distancing and safety precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We have sacrificed to get to this point, and we must keep working together to maintain our progress. Be smart, stay safe and God bless.""
The governor said he would be lifting the stay-at-home order and enacting ""Safer-at-Home"" guidance, which recommends people stay home but allows businesses, factories and religious facilities to reopen, with some measures built in to protect public health.
For example, churches may open but can only do so at 50 percent capacity and are encouraged to hold services outside. Businesses are asked to put down markings to promote social distancing and post signage advising customers not to enter if they are sick.
The recovery plan offers a ""flexible, community-based approach,"" Hogan said, that empowers local leaders to control the timing of the reopening in their individual jurisdictions.
Under the governor's direction, the following would take effect at 5 p.m. Friday:
The new guidance says that local jurisdictions must consult with their health officers to determine whether it is appropriate to open outdoor public spaces, and it allows each jurisdiction to decide if it is safe for certain businesses, organizations, establishments and facilities to open.
""County Executive Glassman plans to reopen as much as the governor has allowed along with following safety measures,"" Glassman's spokeswoman, Cindy Mumby, said Wednesday evening in a statement to Patch.

In just six short weeks since the new coronavirus has changed operations around the state, he said the loss of revenue this fiscal year ""may have hit six figures already,"" impacting the town's capital and operating budgets.
""The economic impact to our operations has been devastating,"" Bane said. ""Our revenue stream continues to be a downward moving target.""
Highway user revenues, money from vehicle titles, the amusement tax and water user fees were all down due to the coronavirus pandemic. While earlier in the month the prediction was that red light camera revenue would be down $200,000, for example, the budget presented Monday night showed a $435,000 reduction.
""Some of our businesses will not survive these shutdowns,"" Bane said. ""These factors will negatively impact our property tax revenues.""
Bane said there were three priorities in his budget:
""The police facility is not dead,"" Bane said. The town is working with architects and will pay for the project to build a new police headquarters with its capital reserve, planning to aggressively pursue construction in FY 2022.
""If there's any good news at all in my forecast I would say it's in the area of minimum wage increase"" because the town is ""ahead of the curve,"" Bane said.
A 2 percent cost-of-living increase will be added to salaries of town employees. While it was the goal of the town to give merit increases, the budget will not allow it, he said.
Federal, state and county budgets project ""serious economic losses"" as well, he said, comparing the impact to the recession of 2008.
""The town may have to reevaluate our operations and our revenue but I believe at this point as a result of our sound economic policies,"" Bane said, ""we are well positioned to weather the economic storm."""

Circumstances due to the new coronavirus have forced Town Administrator Jesse Bane to make significant cuts in putting together the town's FY 2021 budget.
""This budget is a moving target because of what's going on out there with this pandemic,"" Bane said during a recent commissioner work session held by teleconference.
Staff reported the town was coming in $200,000 under red light camera projections, for example, since fewer people were on the road running red lights due to the governor's stay-at-home order.
""It is going to be a very lean budget,"" Bane said. ""We have cut the budget to the bone. This one kind of cuts into the bone.""
In what he called a thumbnail sketch, Bane outlined his budget priorities:
There was a third priority, which he said he would discuss during his presentation Monday.
""COVID-19 is wreaking havoc,"" Bane said. He thanked the department heads for working with him to make adjustments to the numbers. He said it was unclear what the revenue streams may be that bolster the town through the public health crisis. If revenue ends up increasing, he said the town could revisit its priorities mid-year.
""Everyone had to make significant cuts, and it was not a pleasant year with the things that we had to do,"" Bane said. ""I will make a more specific and detailed report of our actions taken to date in dealing with this pandemic at next week's town board meeting.""
Bane will deliver his budget presentation Monday, April 20.
The public hearing on the town administrator's budget will be at 7:30 p.m. on Monday, April 20. Citizens can call 1-877-568-4106 or 312-757-3129 and enter access code 614-751-925.

He said 50 percent of general fund revenue will go to education.
Other priorities include first responders and county employees.
""They are all on the front lines of this crisis,"" Glassman said of the workers, who are helping to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.
The total budget approaches $1 billion, a 4.9 percent increase, he said. The operating budget is $633 million, or 6 percent higher than last year, according to Glassman.
The capital budget is down 7 percent from last year, to curb spending and address essential needs only, such as education and the current public health crisis.
""We have deferred some projects except for education and public safety,"" Glassman said. ""Our reserves will help us weather this storm,"" Glassman said of the new coronavirus.
Here are some items he described as priorities:
Glassman said the funding for first responders was ""historic,"" with nearly $7.196 million toward volunteer fire companies and $3.5 million for Harford County EMS service, including a third crew added for FY 2021.

20,/maryland/belair/virtual-school-harford-county-families-lawmakers-push-back,2020-09-03T13:00:52Z,"Virtual School In Harford County: Families,...",0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — Maryland State Delegate Mike Griffith is one of several parents calling upon Harford County Public Schools to offer families options other than all-virtual learning as the start of the school year approaches. Under the current plan, students in Harford County Public Schools will receive instruction remotely when the fall semester begins Tuesday, Sept. 8.
""This is an issue that impacts students from every corner of our county,"" Griffith said, speaking at a news conference he organized Thursday near Red Pump Elementary School to draw attention to the problems caused by the current path forward.
""The proposed plan will have negative effects on students with special needs, students in rural areas, students of low-income areas,"" Griffith said, ""and of course their families.""
Griffith said he worked with superintendent and governor to apply for CARES Act funding to pay for personal protective equipment for the school system ""to help get our kids in school soon."" He asked Harford County Public Schools to provide families with a choice.
""We have advocated for — at the very least — a hybrid model that allows choice for parents and teachers alike, as many students have shown in-person learning is vital,"" said Griffith.
His son, a 6-year-old who has severe autism, ""suffered significantly"" since the spring and has ""benefited significantly"" from in-person instruction at Hickory Elementary School, he said.
For students in the younger grades, in particular, there are hurdles at the outset of the semester. Due to a device shortage, kindergarten through third-grade students will not have school system-issued laptops. Their parents were told to pick up packets at their schools and have been instructed they will need to teach them, Griffith said.
Susanne Reiter of Bel Air said the ""11th-hour request"" made Aug. 28 for families to come up with their own devices left her household ""scrambling"" to purchase two overpriced Chromebooks.
She and her husband spent $1,036 — the equivalent of six part-time shifts for her husband or her entire biweekly paycheck — so her sons would have laptops, she said.
The school system offered a ""mountain of excuses,"" according to Reiter, who asked Thursday for school system leaders to provide a ""clear and reasonable explanation of its plan going forward.""
State Sen. Jason Gallian, whose daughters are in kindergarten and first grade, said his are among the 15,000 Harford County Public Schools students starting classes without Chromebooks. Gallian said he was concerned about disenfranchising lower-income students and financially burdening parents — who are taxpayers — to shoulder the cost of getting laptops themselves. Connectivity issues in parts of Harford County was also problematic, he said.
""Thousands of families in the county do not have access to high-speed internet,"" Gallian said. ""Teaching is completely ineffective if the internet connection is lost.""
Gov. Larry Hogan and State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon said schools should make plans to bring students back to physical classrooms and offered funding to those that moved forward in the first quarter toward in-person learning, at an Aug. 27 news conference.
""Following the governor's announcement last week, I encourage our school officials to get our children back in chool as soon and safely as possible,"" Gallian said Thursday, Sept. 3.
About 5 percent of students will attend Learning Support Centers at school buildings, according to Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson.
""HCPS' Learning Support Centers are the first step to returning students to school buildings,"" Bulson said.
Senators Bob Cassilly, Gallion and J.B. Jennings as well as Delegates Kathy Szeliga, Teresa Reilly, Susan McComas and Lauren Arikan as well as Griffith signed a letter to Harford County Public Schools Aug. 27 asking that school officials ""revisit their decision"" to hold the first semester online and to give families and teachers a choice about whether to return to the classroom.
""Many students have not opened a textbook since March, and extending that arrangement for another semester is unthinkable,"" the elected officials wrote. ""We are very concerned that the adopted plan for remote learning fails to meet even the basic educational needs of far too many students.""
They said they had heard from ""countless parents"" whose children struggled with the remote learning setup in the spring, after schools closed in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Maryland's positivity rate for the coronavirus has been under 5 percent since June 25, Hogan said, which is the recommended benchmark for reopening. In Harford County, the positivity rate was 3.97 percent as of Tuesday, Sept. 1, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
""The virus is not circulating widely in the community,"" Harford County Councilman Chad Shrodes said at Thursday's news conference. The positivity rate ""has remained under 4 percent for two consecutive weeks"" in Harford County, he said.
""If we begin the year with schools closed or at only 5 percent of their capacity, we are falsely led to assume that this is our only safe option,"" Gallion said. ""It is an uncontrolled experiement supported supported by incomplete data.""
Said Gallion: ""Returning to schools carries little risk, yet keeping them closed costs our students and our communities dearly and causes great harm, potentially a lifetime of damage for some children.""
One was the son of Amanda Bosley-Smith of Forest Hill.
It has been ""debilitating"" for her son — who has autism, is nonverbal and suffers from anxiety — to function without school for five months, she said. Since March when schools closed, he has regressed into self harming behaviors, according to his mother, who said his year-round school was not meeting.
""This abandonment is not only detrimental in the short term,"" Bosley-Smith said, but ""will affect him for the rest of his life.""
It has also negatively impacted everyone in her family, since her son requires one-to-one instruction.
""It feels like the school system is holding my son and my entire family hostage,"" Bosley-Smith said.
Thursday's news conference was not the first time families have expressed concern.
Four weeks ago, parents and students protested outside the Harford County Board of Education meeting, calling for in-person classes to resume. Days later, the school board voted to approve the virtual learning plan.
""Put our children over politics and make the right choice,"" Griffith said. ""Please stop telling us what can't be done and please work with us to tell us what we can do.""

22,/maryland/belair/mail-voting-maryland-deadlines-how-get-ballot,2020-08-26T18:27:09Z,"Mail-In Voting In Maryland: Deadlines, How To...",0,7,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — More than 500,000 mail-in ballots went uncounted during the 2020 primary season nationwide, many of them because they were deemed incomplete or because they arrived too late.
In Maryland, state election officials said nearly 35,000 ballots were rejected during the primary.
Of those, authorities said more than 30,000 ballots were received late and more than 3,000 did not have signatures.
The issue could grow: A record number of voters may stay away from traditional polling places for the Nov. 3 general election because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead cast their ballots by mail.
To help ensure your vote is among those tallied in Maryland, follow this checklist:
Note: Due to a change in law, the Maryland Board of Elections must use the terms ""mail-in ballot"" and ""mail-in voting"" rather than absentee ballot or absentee voting.
With guidelines changing in many states, more than 80 percent of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election, by far the most in U.S. history.
That's a result of 20 states loosening vote-by-mail laws this year due to the pandemic. As of Aug. 25, data from The Washington Post indicates 100 million people will be eligible to vote by mail either with no ""excuse"" or citing fears of the coronavirus as a reason. Among them, 51 million people will be automatically sent a ballot in the mail and 44 million people sent an application for a mail-in ballot.
Only six states still require a valid excuse other than coronavirus fears to vote by mail. Five states had already conducted elections solely by mail even before the pandemic.
Will your vote count?
In the primary election, a study by the Post showed 534,731 ballots were nixed in 23 states, and NPR found even more — 558,032 in 30 states — in a similar study. In New York City alone, more than 84,000 mail-in ballots were tossed and lawsuits were filed over the legitimacy of the outcomes of some close races.
Millions of people will cast their ballots by mail for the first time in the 2020 general election. Pew Research numbers show the number of people who vote by mail had already been on a sharp increase for years. In 2016, more than 20 percent of voters nationwide voted by mail, a total of about 27 million.
Of the 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, officials found 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people, according to Electronic Registration Information Center data analyzed by the Post. That equates to a 0.0025 percent fraud rate. The Brennan Center for Justice has described vote-by-mail fraud as ""infinitesimally small.""
Why are people concerned about a legitimate election with so few documented cases of actual fraud?
Partly, it's problems with the U.S. Postal Service. But equally troublesome are problems that exposed themselves during the primaries. The Post data shows more ballots were rejected in 23 states than the number of absentee ballot rejections reported in the 2016 general election nationwide, in large part because of mistakes in filling out the ballots.
That means a lot more opportunities for inexperienced mail-in voters to make mistakes — which Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says could pose a significant problem in the rejection rate come November.
""Experience matters,"" Smith told the Post. ""If you lack experience voting by mail, the odds of you casting a ballot that doesn't count will go up.""
To make sure your ballot is counted:
Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said if the election between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is close, the mail-in ballots will create ""a mess.""
""The two campaigns will be arguing over nonconforming ballots, which is going to run up against voters' beliefs in fair play,"" Stewart told the Post.
There's also growing concern over the governmental entity tasked with handling the influx of mail-in ballots.
The Postal Service has come under fire for increasingly slow service, mail backlogs and planned changes that some have feared will have an effect on their ability to handle the expected massive increase of mail-in ballots this year.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told senators on Capitol Hill in recent testimony he was unaware of certain changes at the Postal Service until they caused a public uproar. But he also said there are no plans to restore mailboxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed. His testimony raised fresh questions about how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of ballots for the November election.
In Maryland, vote-by-mail drop boxes will be installed so voters can avoid the lines at the polls and not have to worry about Postal Service issues. At least 200 drop boxes will be open until 8 p.m. on Nov. 3.

Among them were changes at the Main Street Tower and Upper Chesapeake Medical Center.
The Main Street Tower was granted permission for its rooftop deck to be used for outdoor dining. The proposal calls for a 1,658-square-foot outdoor dining area.
In September 2019, owner Renato Buontempo appeared before the Bel Air Planning Commission about a 2,311-square-foot outdoor dining area on the rooftop deck.
At that time, the Tower received authorization to update a railing and install a sound wall over the winter. The architect who presented the proposal described it as ""phase one"" of the deck project, for which he said planning began in early 2019. Buontempo and his architect were told they would need to come back to the board with a site plan outlining proposed use of the deck. The planning commission also stipulated that permits would be required for the deck, roof rails and outdoor dining.
At Thursday's hearing, the commission approved the site plan and special development request.
One other proposal before the commission was for an 11,000-square-foot addition to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center at 500 Upper Chesapeake Drive. The expansion would be on the support services part of the hospital. A site plan, landscape plan and special development request were approved.
Plans also got the green light for additions to the previously approved ambulatory surgical center at 515 South Tollgate Road. They include a 16,061-square-foot addition and 2,299-square-foot addition to the first floor, according to the planning commission. The surgical center will offer surgery in a less costly setting than a hospital and is designed to meet the needs of the community for more inpatient and outpatient beds with the future closure of Harford Memorial Hospital, Upper Chesapeake's representative said at previous hearing in November 2018 about the project."

25,/maryland/belair/census-response-harford-county-2nd-highest-maryland,2020-06-27T13:31:00Z,How Much Of Harford County Has Responded To Census,0,1,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"HARFORD COUNTY, MD — Nearly two out of every five U.S. households nationwide have yet to respond to the U.S. Census, stoking fears that billions of federal dollars could be left on the table — dollars that fund crucial services including during the pandemic. Harford County has the third-highest response rate to the U.S. Census in Maryland.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's self-response map, 73.7 households in Harford County have responded to this year's census either online, by phone or by mail.
Nationally, about 61.5 percent of households have responded as of June 26; and in Maryland, 65.7 percent have responded to the census.
This means more than three out of every 10 households in Maryland have not yet been counted.
Here are the counties with the highest response rates in Maryland as of June 26:
People can respond to the census through Oct. 31 online, by phone or by mail.
The purpose of the once-each-decade count is to help determine where $1.5 trillion in federal funding goes and how many congressional seats each state gets.
If 20 percent of the population in Harford County does not get counted in 2020, government officials say the county would lose $93 million in federal funding per year.
The new coronavirus erupted just as the 2020 census was getting underway.
In the wake of mass layoffs and unprecedented economic damage, studies are projecting that more than 4 million people could be undercounted this year.
Should these households not respond, billions of dollars that fund crucial services before, during and after the coronavirus pandemic will be lost. Services include hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and dozens more.
Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.
Both the National Urban League and the NALEO Educational Fund have sounded the alarm that communities with large concentrations of black and Hispanic residents are trailing the rest of the nation in answering the 2020 questionnaire, the Associated Press reported.
A more detailed analysis of response rates in late May and early June conducted by the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center showed that neighborhoods with concentrations of black residents had a self-response rate of 51 percent, compared with 53.8 percent for Hispanic-concentrated neighborhoods and 65.5 percent for white-dominant neighborhoods.
These populations are also among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Young people and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, according to one study. So are women and people of color, Department of Labor data says.
This is causing outreach challenges for both the Census Bureau and organizations providing services to impacted communities.
The Census Bureau suspended field operations in March, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This also included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
The Census Bureau told the Associated Press that it had finished dropping off questionnaire forms in June to almost the 6.8 million mostly rural households across the country.
Organizations nationwide have put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media and telephone calls.
Because of the pandemic, the bureau pushed back the deadline for finishing the 2020 census from the end of July to the end of October, and it asked Congress for a delay in handing over apportionment and redistricting numbers.
Census officials have encouraged Americans to respond to the decennial survey online, a first for the census.
In a move designed to cut costs and keep up with digital lifestyles, the census questionnaire is available at my2020census.gov. Americans can access the online questionnaire by using a 12-digit ID code included with their census invitation sent by mail.

The National Association of Counties (NACo) has recognized Harford County in 2020 with two awards for innovative and effective county government programs. The county was honored with Achievement Awards for its Halloween costume workshop for children who use wheelchairs and the anti-drug Pledge Program for youth, presented in partnership with the Harford County Sheriff's Office.
The Glassman administration has earned a total of eleven NACo awards over the past five years.
""I would like to thank our community partners and sponsors, and our creative county employees, for these outstanding programs,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""Together we were able to help children learn early on about the dangers of drugs and alcohol and give all kids a chance to share in the joys of childhood.""
Halloween Costume Workshop
For some children who use a wheelchair, dressing up in a costume and trick-or-treating in their neighborhood can be a challenge. Traditional Halloween costumes often don't fit and the physical inaccessibility of neighborhoods leaves many children with disabilities home on that magical night. Imagine a place where every child who uses a wheelchair can not only trick or treat with their siblings and peers, but be the star of the evening in a unique costume designed specifically for them. In most communities around the country, this does not exist. In Harford County, Maryland it does.
Rachel Harbin in the Harford County Department of Community Services developed the region's first Wheelchair Costume Workshop, held at Ripken Stadium in October 2019. Over two days, more than 100 community volunteers designed, built and painted completely original costumes that fit securely on 12 children's wheelchairs. Once the costumes were fitted, the children joined over 300 children of all abilities for inclusive trick-or-treating at the stadium, providing an important example to the community that ALL children should be able to have fun, play with their peers, and enjoy Halloween! The Wheelchair Costume Workshop is an outstanding example of a public-private partnership—with over 30 local businesses and community organizations coming together to provide volunteers, donate building materials, and sponsor trick or treat stations.
Pledge Program
The Pledge Program was developed by Tara Lathrop in Harford County government's Office of Drug Control Policy and by the Harford County Sheriff's Office. The program for children ages 8 to 11 years old educates young people before they are exposed to substances and trains them to use refusal skills to resist drugs and alcohol. The interactive program incorporates guest speakers, including a doctor, an individual in recovery, and a parent who has lost a child to drug use. Children also have the opportunity to participate in role play scenarios with local high school theater students to experience mock-peer pressure and practice refusal skills. Another important component of the Pledge Program is the participation of parents and guardians. Parents and caregivers are provided topics to discuss with youth to continue the conversation at home and encourage discussion among family members. Since its inception in January 2019, the Pledge Program has partnered with five Harford County elementary schools with a total of 153 participants. Each participant received training and information that help expand their understanding of drugs and drug use in order to make positive and healthy choices in the future.
""Our community has been rocked by addiction and the overwhelming loss of life to opioid overdoses,"" Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said. ""It isn't enough to lock up dealers, we must find a way to prevent the overdoses from occurring. When Sgt. Aaron Penman approached me with the idea of the Pledge Program, it was an easy 'yes' from me. We know that early intervention is the key to preventing drug use and this program offers us one more tool to prevention and reaching our most vulnerable population, our children. I am exceedingly proud of this program, our partnerships to get this accomplished, and for the young people who are so willing to participate and learn."""

It is one of 17 MVA offices that will open following the months-long closure due to the coronavirus.
Appointments are required to go to the MVA branches that are open to minimize the amount of people in the building at one time.
Those who had to reschedule appointments that had been canceled due to the closure are prioritized first. By order of the governor, the MVA shut down all branches to in-person services March 20. Although the governor enabled these to be extended due to the state of emergency, these cases are prioritized by the MVA first.
Gov. Larry Hogan ordered extensions for driver's licenses, ID cards, permits and registrations that expire March 12 through the state of emergency, and they will not expire until 30 days after the state of emergency is lifted. Currently the state of emergency remains in effect in Maryland.
These services will be available by making an appointment online: learner's permits, commercial driving tests, non-commercial driving tests, driver's license and identification card renewal and title work.
Here are the locations that will open Monday, June 8:
New requirements will be in place at the entryway, in the office itself and at each work station.
Before both customers and employees enter, they must participate in a brief health screening.
Plexiglass dividers will separate work stations inside the MVA office.

In the building, social distancing markers will indicate where people should stand to allow an adequate amount of space between one another.

""We are making the necessary adjustments to our procedures to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and customers,"" MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer said in a statement.
""We appreciate our customers' patience during the closure and look forward to providing premier customer service whether you complete a transaction through our eStore, kiosks, mail-in processes or in person at our branch offices,"" Nizer said.
People can renew registrations, change their address, make insurance compliance payments and get information on flag fees online at mva.maryland.gov.
Since it closed its offices in late March, the MVA reports it has processed more than 740,000 transactions online.

""This is a gradual step forward for businesses with specifics posted on the governor's website,"" Glassman said in a statement.
As additional businesses open and services become available, Glassman said he and health officials were tracking the data around the coronavirus. Cases in Harford County are ""relatively low,"" Glassman said Friday.
""Locally, new cases and fatalities are trending downward; testing is increasing; hospital and ICU capacities appear adequate in case of a surge, and contact tracing is expanding,"" Glassman said.

There are 939 confirmed cases of the virus in Harford County, according to state health officials. A total of 48 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and three others are believed to have died from the virus, with test results pending.
""Two nursing homes continue to represent more than half of reported fatalities,"" Glassman said. There have been 26 resident deaths in congregate living facilities. He advised those of all ages to continue to keep 6 feet between one another.

County officials will begin accepting applications on June 10. Applications and information about the grant programs can be found on the Harford County website.
The grants are being offered to business owners who run small operations that do not meet the standards for either the county's $7,500 business grant or the $2,500 farm grant program. Larger businesses may apply for the $5,000 grant program but city officials are attempting to reserve funds for small businesses.
In an email Wednesday, Harford County spokeswoman Cindy Mumby said that the $7,500 grant program is designated for small businesses with 2-50 employees while the $2,500 program is for farms with 10-plus acres, which. began May 26 and the first handful of payments have already gone out.
The county received 700 applications for the two previous grant programs and expect to be sending payments out to 150-200 applicants per week until all qualified applicants have been paid, Mumby wrote.
Mumby note that County Executive Barry Glassman's goal with all of these programs is to get help to the county's business community as soon as possible. There are no requirements for the minimum number of employees to qualify for the grant program.
""There are plenty of mom-and-pop businesses who do not have two employees, and we did not want to leave them out,"" Mumby told The Baltimore Sun.
According to county officials, the funds will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. The grants will be paid out of the county's first round of CARES funding, which is about $22 million.
County officials said that the $5,000 grant can only be used for commercial mortgages, rent or leases."

The executive order takes effect at 5 p.m. Friday, May 29, concurrent with the order Gov. Larry Hogan issued permitting restaurants and bars to serve patrons outside.
In announcing that outdoor dining would be allowed once again in Maryland, the governor called upon the leaders of local jurisdictions to work with businesses to reopen.
""We love the idea of closing streets for outside seating in Little Italy and Fells Point in Baltimore City, on West Street and Main Street in Annapolis, on Bethesda Row and in other towns across the state,"" Hogan said during a news conference Wednesday where he announced the relaxation of requirements. Hogan said he was ""strongly encouraging local leaders to find innovative ways to help support our restaurant businesses.""
The executive order that Glassman signed Thursday gives restaurants more space in their parking lots for outside dining by waiving several provisions of Harford County code, including those that have to do with off-street parking requirements, temporary uses, setbacks, seating capacity, outdoor displays, premise signage and outdoor storage.
""This action will make it easier for restaurants to offer outside dining, similar to my prior Executive Order facilitating outdoor retail sales,"" Glassman said in a statement. ""As with each step in reopening, everyone must follow required safety precautions so we can continue moving forward together.""

The new order from the governor allows restaurants and bars to serve food and drinks to customers in outdoor areas if they meet the following requirements:
Hogan also said restaurants should offer disposable, single-use menus or sanitize reusable menus between each seating, screen staff through daily temperature checks and train staff members in current COVID-19 guidelines.
The new outdoor dining guidance applies to restaurants and bars as well as social and fraternal clubs, including American Legion posts, VFW posts and Elks Clubs.

Larry Hogan announced his plan to lift the stay-at-home order at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland, he followed by saying local leaders had the capacity to determine whether that was appropriate for their jurisdictions. County Executive Barry Glassman plans for Harford County to fall into alignment with the governor's orders.
""I am pleased to announce that in consultation with our health officer, Harford County will reopen on Friday at 5 p.m. as outlined in Gov.

""At the same time, all citizens should continue to follow required social distancing and safety precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We have sacrificed to get to this point, and we must keep working together to maintain our progress. Be smart, stay safe and God bless.""
The governor said he would be lifting the stay-at-home order and enacting ""Safer-at-Home"" guidance, which recommends people stay home but allows businesses, factories and religious facilities to reopen, with some measures built in to protect public health.
For example, churches may open but can only do so at 50 percent capacity and are encouraged to hold services outside. Businesses are asked to put down markings to promote social distancing and post signage advising customers not to enter if they are sick.
The recovery plan offers a ""flexible, community-based approach,"" Hogan said, that empowers local leaders to control the timing of the reopening in their individual jurisdictions.
Under the governor's direction, the following would take effect at 5 p.m. Friday:
The new guidance says that local jurisdictions must consult with their health officers to determine whether it is appropriate to open outdoor public spaces, and it allows each jurisdiction to decide if it is safe for certain businesses, organizations, establishments and facilities to open.

In just six short weeks since the new coronavirus has changed operations around the state, he said the loss of revenue this fiscal year ""may have hit six figures already,"" impacting the town's capital and operating budgets.
""The economic impact to our operations has been devastating,"" Bane said. ""Our revenue stream continues to be a downward moving target.""
Highway user revenues, money from vehicle titles, the amusement tax and water user fees were all down due to the coronavirus pandemic. While earlier in the month the prediction was that red light camera revenue would be down $200,000, for example, the budget presented Monday night showed a $435,000 reduction.
""Some of our businesses will not survive these shutdowns,"" Bane said. ""These factors will negatively impact our property tax revenues.""
Bane said there were three priorities in his budget:
""The police facility is not dead,"" Bane said. The town is working with architects and will pay for the project to build a new police headquarters with its capital reserve, planning to aggressively pursue construction in FY 2022.
""If there's any good news at all in my forecast I would say it's in the area of minimum wage increase"" because the town is ""ahead of the curve,"" Bane said.
A 2 percent cost-of-living increase will be added to salaries of town employees. While it was the goal of the town to give merit increases, the budget will not allow it, he said.
Federal, state and county budgets project ""serious economic losses"" as well, he said, comparing the impact to the recession of 2008.
""The town may have to reevaluate our operations and our revenue but I believe at this point as a result of our sound economic policies,"" Bane said, ""we are well positioned to weather the economic storm."""

""This budget is a moving target because of what's going on out there with this pandemic,"" Bane said during a recent commissioner work session held by teleconference.
Staff reported the town was coming in $200,000 under red light camera projections, for example, since fewer people were on the road running red lights due to the governor's stay-at-home order.
""It is going to be a very lean budget,"" Bane said. ""We have cut the budget to the bone. This one kind of cuts into the bone.""
In what he called a thumbnail sketch, Bane outlined his budget priorities:
There was a third priority, which he said he would discuss during his presentation Monday.
""COVID-19 is wreaking havoc,"" Bane said. He thanked the department heads for working with him to make adjustments to the numbers. He said it was unclear what the revenue streams may be that bolster the town through the public health crisis. If revenue ends up increasing, he said the town could revisit its priorities mid-year.
""Everyone had to make significant cuts, and it was not a pleasant year with the things that we had to do,"" Bane said. ""I will make a more specific and detailed report of our actions taken to date in dealing with this pandemic at next week's town board meeting.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Harford County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year.
Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in 2016, working with ProPublica to bring you information about vandalism at one polling place in Baltimore and a missing ballot page at another, broken scanners at the polls in New York, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail-in ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences.

Under the current plan, students in Harford County Public Schools will receive instruction remotely when the fall semester begins Tuesday, Sept. 8.
""This is an issue that impacts students from every corner of our county,"" Griffith said, speaking at a news conference he organized Thursday near Red Pump Elementary School to draw attention to the problems caused by the current path forward.
""The proposed plan will have negative effects on students with special needs, students in rural areas, students of low-income areas,"" Griffith said, ""and of course their families.""
Griffith said he worked with superintendent and governor to apply for CARES Act funding to pay for personal protective equipment for the school system ""to help get our kids in school soon."" He asked Harford County Public Schools to provide families with a choice.
""We have advocated for — at the very least — a hybrid model that allows choice for parents and teachers alike, as many students have shown in-person learning is vital,"" said Griffith.
His son, a 6-year-old who has severe autism, ""suffered significantly"" since the spring and has ""benefited significantly"" from in-person instruction at Hickory Elementary School, he said.
For students in the younger grades, in particular, there are hurdles at the outset of the semester. Due to a device shortage, kindergarten through third-grade students will not have school system-issued laptops. Their parents were told to pick up packets at their schools and have been instructed they will need to teach them, Griffith said.
Susanne Reiter of Bel Air said the ""11th-hour request"" made Aug. 28 for families to come up with their own devices left her household ""scrambling"" to purchase two overpriced Chromebooks.
She and her husband spent $1,036 — the equivalent of six part-time shifts for her husband or her entire biweekly paycheck — so her sons would have laptops, she said.
The school system offered a ""mountain of excuses,"" according to Reiter, who asked Thursday for school system leaders to provide a ""clear and reasonable explanation of its plan going forward.""
State Sen. Jason Gallian, whose daughters are in kindergarten and first grade, said his are among the 15,000 Harford County Public Schools students starting classes without Chromebooks. Gallian said he was concerned about disenfranchising lower-income students and financially burdening parents — who are taxpayers — to shoulder the cost of getting laptops themselves. Connectivity issues in parts of Harford County was also problematic, he said.
""Thousands of families in the county do not have access to high-speed internet,"" Gallian said. ""Teaching is completely ineffective if the internet connection is lost.""
Gov. Larry Hogan and State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon said schools should make plans to bring students back to physical classrooms and offered funding to those that moved forward in the first quarter toward in-person learning, at an Aug. 27 news conference.
""Following the governor's announcement last week, I encourage our school officials to get our children back in chool as soon and safely as possible,"" Gallian said Thursday, Sept. 3.
About 5 percent of students will attend Learning Support Centers at school buildings, according to Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson.
""HCPS' Learning Support Centers are the first step to returning students to school buildings,"" Bulson said.
Senators Bob Cassilly, Gallion and J.B. Jennings as well as Delegates Kathy Szeliga, Teresa Reilly, Susan McComas and Lauren Arikan as well as Griffith signed a letter to Harford County Public Schools Aug. 27 asking that school officials ""revisit their decision"" to hold the first semester online and to give families and teachers a choice about whether to return to the classroom.
""Many students have not opened a textbook since March, and extending that arrangement for another semester is unthinkable,"" the elected officials wrote. ""We are very concerned that the adopted plan for remote learning fails to meet even the basic educational needs of far too many students.""
They said they had heard from ""countless parents"" whose children struggled with the remote learning setup in the spring, after schools closed in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Maryland's positivity rate for the coronavirus has been under 5 percent since June 25, Hogan said, which is the recommended benchmark for reopening. In Harford County, the positivity rate was 3.97 percent as of Tuesday, Sept. 1, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
""The virus is not circulating widely in the community,"" Harford County Councilman Chad Shrodes said at Thursday's news conference. The positivity rate ""has remained under 4 percent for two consecutive weeks"" in Harford County, he said.
""If we begin the year with schools closed or at only 5 percent of their capacity, we are falsely led to assume that this is our only safe option,"" Gallion said. ""It is an uncontrolled experiement supported supported by incomplete data.""
Said Gallion: ""Returning to schools carries little risk, yet keeping them closed costs our students and our communities dearly and causes great harm, potentially a lifetime of damage for some children.""
One was the son of Amanda Bosley-Smith of Forest Hill.
It has been ""debilitating"" for her son — who has autism, is nonverbal and suffers from anxiety — to function without school for five months, she said. Since March when schools closed, he has regressed into self harming behaviors, according to his mother, who said his year-round school was not meeting.
""This abandonment is not only detrimental in the short term,"" Bosley-Smith said, but ""will affect him for the rest of his life.""
It has also negatively impacted everyone in her family, since her son requires one-to-one instruction.
""It feels like the school system is holding my son and my entire family hostage,"" Bosley-Smith said.
Thursday's news conference was not the first time families have expressed concern.
Four weeks ago, parents and students protested outside the Harford County Board of Education meeting, calling for in-person classes to resume. Days later, the school board voted to approve the virtual learning plan.
""Put our children over politics and make the right choice,"" Griffith said. ""Please stop telling us what can't be done and please work with us to tell us what we can do.""

Larry Hogan said the state would be moving into stage three of its reopening, County Executive Barry Glassman said the plan for Harford County was to follow suit.
""Harford County's metrics remain low, and we will continue to safely and quickly reopen to the extent permitted by Gov. Hogan effective at 5 p.m. Friday, Sept. 4, 2020,"" Glassman said in a statement Tuesday night.
Harford County has 2,500 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and 67 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
Masks are still required in retail establishments, on public transit and in situations where people cannot maintain 6 feet of physical distance.

43,/maryland/belair/mail-voting-maryland-deadlines-how-get-ballot,2020-08-26T18:27:09Z,"Mail-In Voting In Maryland: Deadlines, How To...",0,7,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — More than 500,000 mail-in ballots went uncounted during the 2020 primary season nationwide, many of them because they were deemed incomplete or because they arrived too late.
In Maryland, state election officials said nearly 35,000 ballots were rejected during the primary.
Of those, authorities said more than 30,000 ballots were received late and more than 3,000 did not have signatures.
The issue could grow: A record number of voters may stay away from traditional polling places for the Nov. 3 general election because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead cast their ballots by mail.
To help ensure your vote is among those tallied in Maryland, follow this checklist:
Note: Due to a change in law, the Maryland Board of Elections must use the terms ""mail-in ballot"" and ""mail-in voting"" rather than absentee ballot or absentee voting.
With guidelines changing in many states, more than 80 percent of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election, by far the most in U.S. history.
That's a result of 20 states loosening vote-by-mail laws this year due to the pandemic. As of Aug. 25, data from The Washington Post indicates 100 million people will be eligible to vote by mail either with no ""excuse"" or citing fears of the coronavirus as a reason. Among them, 51 million people will be automatically sent a ballot in the mail and 44 million people sent an application for a mail-in ballot.
Only six states still require a valid excuse other than coronavirus fears to vote by mail. Five states had already conducted elections solely by mail even before the pandemic.
Will your vote count?
In the primary election, a study by the Post showed 534,731 ballots were nixed in 23 states, and NPR found even more — 558,032 in 30 states — in a similar study. In New York City alone, more than 84,000 mail-in ballots were tossed and lawsuits were filed over the legitimacy of the outcomes of some close races.
Millions of people will cast their ballots by mail for the first time in the 2020 general election. Pew Research numbers show the number of people who vote by mail had already been on a sharp increase for years. In 2016, more than 20 percent of voters nationwide voted by mail, a total of about 27 million.
Of the 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, officials found 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people, according to Electronic Registration Information Center data analyzed by the Post. That equates to a 0.0025 percent fraud rate. The Brennan Center for Justice has described vote-by-mail fraud as ""infinitesimally small.""
Why are people concerned about a legitimate election with so few documented cases of actual fraud?
Partly, it's problems with the U.S. Postal Service. But equally troublesome are problems that exposed themselves during the primaries. The Post data shows more ballots were rejected in 23 states than the number of absentee ballot rejections reported in the 2016 general election nationwide, in large part because of mistakes in filling out the ballots.
That means a lot more opportunities for inexperienced mail-in voters to make mistakes — which Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says could pose a significant problem in the rejection rate come November.
""Experience matters,"" Smith told the Post. ""If you lack experience voting by mail, the odds of you casting a ballot that doesn't count will go up.""
To make sure your ballot is counted:
Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said if the election between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is close, the mail-in ballots will create ""a mess.""
""The two campaigns will be arguing over nonconforming ballots, which is going to run up against voters' beliefs in fair play,"" Stewart told the Post.
There's also growing concern over the governmental entity tasked with handling the influx of mail-in ballots.
The Postal Service has come under fire for increasingly slow service, mail backlogs and planned changes that some have feared will have an effect on their ability to handle the expected massive increase of mail-in ballots this year.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told senators on Capitol Hill in recent testimony he was unaware of certain changes at the Postal Service until they caused a public uproar. But he also said there are no plans to restore mailboxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed. His testimony raised fresh questions about how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of ballots for the November election.
In Maryland, vote-by-mail drop boxes will be installed so voters can avoid the lines at the polls and not have to worry about Postal Service issues. At least 200 drop boxes will be open until 8 p.m. on Nov. 3.

Among them were changes at the Main Street Tower and Upper Chesapeake Medical Center.
The Main Street Tower was granted permission for its rooftop deck to be used for outdoor dining. The proposal calls for a 1,658-square-foot outdoor dining area.
In September 2019, owner Renato Buontempo appeared before the Bel Air Planning Commission about a 2,311-square-foot outdoor dining area on the rooftop deck.
At that time, the Tower received authorization to update a railing and install a sound wall over the winter. The architect who presented the proposal described it as ""phase one"" of the deck project, for which he said planning began in early 2019. Buontempo and his architect were told they would need to come back to the board with a site plan outlining proposed use of the deck. The planning commission also stipulated that permits would be required for the deck, roof rails and outdoor dining.
At Thursday's hearing, the commission approved the site plan and special development request.
One other proposal before the commission was for an 11,000-square-foot addition to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center at 500 Upper Chesapeake Drive. The expansion would be on the support services part of the hospital. A site plan, landscape plan and special development request were approved.
Plans also got the green light for additions to the previously approved ambulatory surgical center at 515 South Tollgate Road. They include a 16,061-square-foot addition and 2,299-square-foot addition to the first floor, according to the planning commission. The surgical center will offer surgery in a less costly setting than a hospital and is designed to meet the needs of the community for more inpatient and outpatient beds with the future closure of Harford Memorial Hospital, Upper Chesapeake's representative said at previous hearing in November 2018 about the project."

46,/maryland/belair/census-response-harford-county-2nd-highest-maryland,2020-06-27T13:31:00Z,How Much Of Harford County Has Responded To Census,0,1,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"HARFORD COUNTY, MD — Nearly two out of every five U.S. households nationwide have yet to respond to the U.S. Census, stoking fears that billions of federal dollars could be left on the table — dollars that fund crucial services including during the pandemic. Harford County has the third-highest response rate to the U.S. Census in Maryland.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's self-response map, 73.7 households in Harford County have responded to this year's census either online, by phone or by mail.
Nationally, about 61.5 percent of households have responded as of June 26; and in Maryland, 65.7 percent have responded to the census.
This means more than three out of every 10 households in Maryland have not yet been counted.
Here are the counties with the highest response rates in Maryland as of June 26:
People can respond to the census through Oct. 31 online, by phone or by mail.
The purpose of the once-each-decade count is to help determine where $1.5 trillion in federal funding goes and how many congressional seats each state gets.
If 20 percent of the population in Harford County does not get counted in 2020, government officials say the county would lose $93 million in federal funding per year.
The new coronavirus erupted just as the 2020 census was getting underway.
In the wake of mass layoffs and unprecedented economic damage, studies are projecting that more than 4 million people could be undercounted this year.
Should these households not respond, billions of dollars that fund crucial services before, during and after the coronavirus pandemic will be lost. Services include hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and dozens more.
Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.
Both the National Urban League and the NALEO Educational Fund have sounded the alarm that communities with large concentrations of black and Hispanic residents are trailing the rest of the nation in answering the 2020 questionnaire, the Associated Press reported.
A more detailed analysis of response rates in late May and early June conducted by the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center showed that neighborhoods with concentrations of black residents had a self-response rate of 51 percent, compared with 53.8 percent for Hispanic-concentrated neighborhoods and 65.5 percent for white-dominant neighborhoods.
These populations are also among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Young people and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, according to one study. So are women and people of color, Department of Labor data says.
This is causing outreach challenges for both the Census Bureau and organizations providing services to impacted communities.
The Census Bureau suspended field operations in March, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This also included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
The Census Bureau told the Associated Press that it had finished dropping off questionnaire forms in June to almost the 6.8 million mostly rural households across the country.
Organizations nationwide have put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media and telephone calls.
Because of the pandemic, the bureau pushed back the deadline for finishing the 2020 census from the end of July to the end of October, and it asked Congress for a delay in handing over apportionment and redistricting numbers.
Census officials have encouraged Americans to respond to the decennial survey online, a first for the census.
In a move designed to cut costs and keep up with digital lifestyles, the census questionnaire is available at my2020census.gov. Americans can access the online questionnaire by using a 12-digit ID code included with their census invitation sent by mail.

The National Association of Counties (NACo) has recognized Harford County in 2020 with two awards for innovative and effective county government programs. The county was honored with Achievement Awards for its Halloween costume workshop for children who use wheelchairs and the anti-drug Pledge Program for youth, presented in partnership with the Harford County Sheriff's Office.
The Glassman administration has earned a total of eleven NACo awards over the past five years.
""I would like to thank our community partners and sponsors, and our creative county employees, for these outstanding programs,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""Together we were able to help children learn early on about the dangers of drugs and alcohol and give all kids a chance to share in the joys of childhood.""
Halloween Costume Workshop
For some children who use a wheelchair, dressing up in a costume and trick-or-treating in their neighborhood can be a challenge. Traditional Halloween costumes often don't fit and the physical inaccessibility of neighborhoods leaves many children with disabilities home on that magical night. Imagine a place where every child who uses a wheelchair can not only trick or treat with their siblings and peers, but be the star of the evening in a unique costume designed specifically for them. In most communities around the country, this does not exist. In Harford County, Maryland it does.
Rachel Harbin in the Harford County Department of Community Services developed the region's first Wheelchair Costume Workshop, held at Ripken Stadium in October 2019. Over two days, more than 100 community volunteers designed, built and painted completely original costumes that fit securely on 12 children's wheelchairs. Once the costumes were fitted, the children joined over 300 children of all abilities for inclusive trick-or-treating at the stadium, providing an important example to the community that ALL children should be able to have fun, play with their peers, and enjoy Halloween! The Wheelchair Costume Workshop is an outstanding example of a public-private partnership—with over 30 local businesses and community organizations coming together to provide volunteers, donate building materials, and sponsor trick or treat stations.
Pledge Program
The Pledge Program was developed by Tara Lathrop in Harford County government's Office of Drug Control Policy and by the Harford County Sheriff's Office. The program for children ages 8 to 11 years old educates young people before they are exposed to substances and trains them to use refusal skills to resist drugs and alcohol. The interactive program incorporates guest speakers, including a doctor, an individual in recovery, and a parent who has lost a child to drug use. Children also have the opportunity to participate in role play scenarios with local high school theater students to experience mock-peer pressure and practice refusal skills. Another important component of the Pledge Program is the participation of parents and guardians. Parents and caregivers are provided topics to discuss with youth to continue the conversation at home and encourage discussion among family members. Since its inception in January 2019, the Pledge Program has partnered with five Harford County elementary schools with a total of 153 participants. Each participant received training and information that help expand their understanding of drugs and drug use in order to make positive and healthy choices in the future.
""Our community has been rocked by addiction and the overwhelming loss of life to opioid overdoses,"" Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said. ""It isn't enough to lock up dealers, we must find a way to prevent the overdoses from occurring. When Sgt. Aaron Penman approached me with the idea of the Pledge Program, it was an easy 'yes' from me. We know that early intervention is the key to preventing drug use and this program offers us one more tool to prevention and reaching our most vulnerable population, our children. I am exceedingly proud of this program, our partnerships to get this accomplished, and for the young people who are so willing to participate and learn."""

It is one of 17 MVA offices that will open following the months-long closure due to the coronavirus.
Appointments are required to go to the MVA branches that are open to minimize the amount of people in the building at one time.
Those who had to reschedule appointments that had been canceled due to the closure are prioritized first. By order of the governor, the MVA shut down all branches to in-person services March 20. Although the governor enabled these to be extended due to the state of emergency, these cases are prioritized by the MVA first.
Gov. Larry Hogan ordered extensions for driver's licenses, ID cards, permits and registrations that expire March 12 through the state of emergency, and they will not expire until 30 days after the state of emergency is lifted. Currently the state of emergency remains in effect in Maryland.
These services will be available by making an appointment online: learner's permits, commercial driving tests, non-commercial driving tests, driver's license and identification card renewal and title work.
Here are the locations that will open Monday, June 8:
New requirements will be in place at the entryway, in the office itself and at each work station.
Before both customers and employees enter, they must participate in a brief health screening.
Plexiglass dividers will separate work stations inside the MVA office.

In the building, social distancing markers will indicate where people should stand to allow an adequate amount of space between one another.

""We are making the necessary adjustments to our procedures to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and customers,"" MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer said in a statement.
""We appreciate our customers' patience during the closure and look forward to providing premier customer service whether you complete a transaction through our eStore, kiosks, mail-in processes or in person at our branch offices,"" Nizer said.
People can renew registrations, change their address, make insurance compliance payments and get information on flag fees online at mva.maryland.gov.
Since it closed its offices in late March, the MVA reports it has processed more than 740,000 transactions online.

County officials will begin accepting applications on June 10. Applications and information about the grant programs can be found on the Harford County website.
The grants are being offered to business owners who run small operations that do not meet the standards for either the county's $7,500 business grant or the $2,500 farm grant program. Larger businesses may apply for the $5,000 grant program but city officials are attempting to reserve funds for small businesses.

The county received 700 applications for the two previous grant programs and expect to be sending payments out to 150-200 applicants per week until all qualified applicants have been paid, Mumby wrote.

54,/maryland/belair/outdoor-dining-harford-county-executive-waives-code-restrictions,2020-05-28T18:34:14Z,Outdoor Dining Restrictions Lifted By Glassman,1,3,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — To allow restaurants, bars and breweries to expand their footprints, Harford County Executive Barry Glassman signed an executive order Thursday waiving parts of the county code that will make outdoor dining easier. The executive order takes effect at 5 p.m. Friday, May 29, concurrent with the order Gov. Larry Hogan issued permitting restaurants and bars to serve patrons outside.
In announcing that outdoor dining would be allowed once again in Maryland, the governor called upon the leaders of local jurisdictions to work with businesses to reopen.
""We love the idea of closing streets for outside seating in Little Italy and Fells Point in Baltimore City, on West Street and Main Street in Annapolis, on Bethesda Row and in other towns across the state,"" Hogan said during a news conference Wednesday where he announced the relaxation of requirements. Hogan said he was ""strongly encouraging local leaders to find innovative ways to help support our restaurant businesses.""
The executive order that Glassman signed Thursday gives restaurants more space in their parking lots for outside dining by waiving several provisions of Harford County code, including those that have to do with off-street parking requirements, temporary uses, setbacks, seating capacity, outdoor displays, premise signage and outdoor storage.
""This action will make it easier for restaurants to offer outside dining, similar to my prior Executive Order facilitating outdoor retail sales,"" Glassman said in a statement. ""As with each step in reopening, everyone must follow required safety precautions so we can continue moving forward together.""

The new order from the governor allows restaurants and bars to serve food and drinks to customers in outdoor areas if they meet the following requirements:
Hogan also said restaurants should offer disposable, single-use menus or sanitize reusable menus between each seating, screen staff through daily temperature checks and train staff members in current COVID-19 guidelines.
The new outdoor dining guidance applies to restaurants and bars as well as social and fraternal clubs, including American Legion posts, VFW posts and Elks Clubs.

Larry Hogan announced his plan to lift the stay-at-home order at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland, he followed by saying local leaders had the capacity to determine whether that was appropriate for their jurisdictions. County Executive Barry Glassman plans for Harford County to fall into alignment with the governor's orders.
""I am pleased to announce that in consultation with our health officer, Harford County will reopen on Friday at 5 p.m. as outlined in Gov. Hogan's Safer at Home advisory,"" Glassman said in a statement Thursday. ""At the same time, all citizens should continue to follow required social distancing and safety precautions to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our community. We have sacrificed to get to this point, and we must keep working together to maintain our progress. Be smart, stay safe and God bless.""
The governor said he would be lifting the stay-at-home order and enacting ""Safer-at-Home"" guidance, which recommends people stay home but allows businesses, factories and religious facilities to reopen, with some measures built in to protect public health.
For example, churches may open but can only do so at 50 percent capacity and are encouraged to hold services outside. Businesses are asked to put down markings to promote social distancing and post signage advising customers not to enter if they are sick.
The recovery plan offers a ""flexible, community-based approach,"" Hogan said, that empowers local leaders to control the timing of the reopening in their individual jurisdictions.
Under the governor's direction, the following would take effect at 5 p.m. Friday:
The new guidance says that local jurisdictions must consult with their health officers to determine whether it is appropriate to open outdoor public spaces, and it allows each jurisdiction to decide if it is safe for certain businesses, organizations, establishments and facilities to open.
""County Executive Glassman plans to reopen as much as the governor has allowed along with following safety measures,"" Glassman's spokeswoman, Cindy Mumby, said Wednesday evening in a statement to Patch.

In just six short weeks since the new coronavirus has changed operations around the state, he said the loss of revenue this fiscal year ""may have hit six figures already,"" impacting the town's capital and operating budgets.
""The economic impact to our operations has been devastating,"" Bane said. ""Our revenue stream continues to be a downward moving target.""
Highway user revenues, money from vehicle titles, the amusement tax and water user fees were all down due to the coronavirus pandemic. While earlier in the month the prediction was that red light camera revenue would be down $200,000, for example, the budget presented Monday night showed a $435,000 reduction.
""Some of our businesses will not survive these shutdowns,"" Bane said. ""These factors will negatively impact our property tax revenues.""
Bane said there were three priorities in his budget:
""The police facility is not dead,"" Bane said. The town is working with architects and will pay for the project to build a new police headquarters with its capital reserve, planning to aggressively pursue construction in FY 2022.
""If there's any good news at all in my forecast I would say it's in the area of minimum wage increase"" because the town is ""ahead of the curve,"" Bane said.
A 2 percent cost-of-living increase will be added to salaries of town employees. While it was the goal of the town to give merit increases, the budget will not allow it, he said.
Federal, state and county budgets project ""serious economic losses"" as well, he said, comparing the impact to the recession of 2008.
""The town may have to reevaluate our operations and our revenue but I believe at this point as a result of our sound economic policies,"" Bane said, ""we are well positioned to weather the economic storm."""

Circumstances due to the new coronavirus have forced Town Administrator Jesse Bane to make significant cuts in putting together the town's FY 2021 budget.
""This budget is a moving target because of what's going on out there with this pandemic,"" Bane said during a recent commissioner work session held by teleconference.
Staff reported the town was coming in $200,000 under red light camera projections, for example, since fewer people were on the road running red lights due to the governor's stay-at-home order.
""It is going to be a very lean budget,"" Bane said. ""We have cut the budget to the bone. This one kind of cuts into the bone.""
In what he called a thumbnail sketch, Bane outlined his budget priorities:
There was a third priority, which he said he would discuss during his presentation Monday.
""COVID-19 is wreaking havoc,"" Bane said. He thanked the department heads for working with him to make adjustments to the numbers. He said it was unclear what the revenue streams may be that bolster the town through the public health crisis. If revenue ends up increasing, he said the town could revisit its priorities mid-year.
""Everyone had to make significant cuts, and it was not a pleasant year with the things that we had to do,"" Bane said. ""I will make a more specific and detailed report of our actions taken to date in dealing with this pandemic at next week's town board meeting.""
Bane will deliver his budget presentation Monday, April 20.

Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order allowing indoor operations to increase from 50 to 75 percent capacity, effective at 5 p.m. Monday, Sept. 21.
Buffets are still not allowed, and neither is serving patrons who are not seated.
Appropriate physical distancing and other precautions will be required to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Hogan's executive order states that retailers, religious facilities and restaurants may all operate at 75 percent capacity.
The state guidance can be tailored for each jurisdiction. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County remain under tighter restrictions than the rest of Maryland.
Increasing capacity at indoor dining establishments coincides with the state's first Maryland Restaurant Week, which is Sept. 18 through Sept. 27 and is in partnership with the Restaurant Association of Maryland and Visit Maryland.
""Restaurants in Maryland are pleased that the Governor has heard their concerns and has increased indoor dining capacity to 75 percent,"" President/CEO of the Restaurant Association of Maryland Marshall Weston said in a statement.
""The weather will soon eliminate outdoor dining as a viable option and the increase of indoor capacity will help make up for that loss,"" Weston said. ""We encourage all counties to follow the governor's executive order and not delay implementation. Restaurants will continue to serve their customers safely even with these increased capacities.""
The goal is to give businesses a boost after economic fallout from the virus, Hogan said.
""This is a perfect time to enjoy going to your favorite restaurant or trying a new place to show your support on behalf of the Maryland restaurant industry,"" according to a statement from the governor's office, which said: ""By joining together in support of this effort, Marylanders will be giving a much-needed boost to restaurants recovering from coronavirus-related restrictions while helping food service employees and their community.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Harford County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year.
Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in 2016, working with ProPublica to bring you information about vandalism at one polling place in Baltimore and a missing ballot page at another, broken scanners at the polls in New York, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail-in ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences.

63,/maryland/belair/virtual-school-harford-county-families-lawmakers-push-back,2020-09-03T13:00:52Z,"Virtual School In Harford County: Families,...",0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — Maryland State Delegate Mike Griffith is one of several parents calling upon Harford County Public Schools to offer families options other than all-virtual learning as the start of the school year approaches. Under the current plan, students in Harford County Public Schools will receive instruction remotely when the fall semester begins Tuesday, Sept. 8.
""This is an issue that impacts students from every corner of our county,"" Griffith said, speaking at a news conference he organized Thursday near Red Pump Elementary School to draw attention to the problems caused by the current path forward.
""The proposed plan will have negative effects on students with special needs, students in rural areas, students of low-income areas,"" Griffith said, ""and of course their families.""
Griffith said he worked with superintendent and governor to apply for CARES Act funding to pay for personal protective equipment for the school system ""to help get our kids in school soon."" He asked Harford County Public Schools to provide families with a choice.
""We have advocated for — at the very least — a hybrid model that allows choice for parents and teachers alike, as many students have shown in-person learning is vital,"" said Griffith.
His son, a 6-year-old who has severe autism, ""suffered significantly"" since the spring and has ""benefited significantly"" from in-person instruction at Hickory Elementary School, he said.
For students in the younger grades, in particular, there are hurdles at the outset of the semester. Due to a device shortage, kindergarten through third-grade students will not have school system-issued laptops. Their parents were told to pick up packets at their schools and have been instructed they will need to teach them, Griffith said.
Susanne Reiter of Bel Air said the ""11th-hour request"" made Aug. 28 for families to come up with their own devices left her household ""scrambling"" to purchase two overpriced Chromebooks.
She and her husband spent $1,036 — the equivalent of six part-time shifts for her husband or her entire biweekly paycheck — so her sons would have laptops, she said.
The school system offered a ""mountain of excuses,"" according to Reiter, who asked Thursday for school system leaders to provide a ""clear and reasonable explanation of its plan going forward.""
State Sen. Jason Gallian, whose daughters are in kindergarten and first grade, said his are among the 15,000 Harford County Public Schools students starting classes without Chromebooks. Gallian said he was concerned about disenfranchising lower-income students and financially burdening parents — who are taxpayers — to shoulder the cost of getting laptops themselves. Connectivity issues in parts of Harford County was also problematic, he said.
""Thousands of families in the county do not have access to high-speed internet,"" Gallian said. ""Teaching is completely ineffective if the internet connection is lost.""
Gov. Larry Hogan and State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon said schools should make plans to bring students back to physical classrooms and offered funding to those that moved forward in the first quarter toward in-person learning, at an Aug. 27 news conference.
""Following the governor's announcement last week, I encourage our school officials to get our children back in chool as soon and safely as possible,"" Gallian said Thursday, Sept. 3.
About 5 percent of students will attend Learning Support Centers at school buildings, according to Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson.
""HCPS' Learning Support Centers are the first step to returning students to school buildings,"" Bulson said.
Senators Bob Cassilly, Gallion and J.B. Jennings as well as Delegates Kathy Szeliga, Teresa Reilly, Susan McComas and Lauren Arikan as well as Griffith signed a letter to Harford County Public Schools Aug. 27 asking that school officials ""revisit their decision"" to hold the first semester online and to give families and teachers a choice about whether to return to the classroom.
""Many students have not opened a textbook since March, and extending that arrangement for another semester is unthinkable,"" the elected officials wrote. ""We are very concerned that the adopted plan for remote learning fails to meet even the basic educational needs of far too many students.""
They said they had heard from ""countless parents"" whose children struggled with the remote learning setup in the spring, after schools closed in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Maryland's positivity rate for the coronavirus has been under 5 percent since June 25, Hogan said, which is the recommended benchmark for reopening. In Harford County, the positivity rate was 3.97 percent as of Tuesday, Sept. 1, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
""The virus is not circulating widely in the community,"" Harford County Councilman Chad Shrodes said at Thursday's news conference. The positivity rate ""has remained under 4 percent for two consecutive weeks"" in Harford County, he said.
""If we begin the year with schools closed or at only 5 percent of their capacity, we are falsely led to assume that this is our only safe option,"" Gallion said. ""It is an uncontrolled experiement supported supported by incomplete data.""
Said Gallion: ""Returning to schools carries little risk, yet keeping them closed costs our students and our communities dearly and causes great harm, potentially a lifetime of damage for some children.""
One was the son of Amanda Bosley-Smith of Forest Hill.
It has been ""debilitating"" for her son — who has autism, is nonverbal and suffers from anxiety — to function without school for five months, she said. Since March when schools closed, he has regressed into self harming behaviors, according to his mother, who said his year-round school was not meeting.
""This abandonment is not only detrimental in the short term,"" Bosley-Smith said, but ""will affect him for the rest of his life.""
It has also negatively impacted everyone in her family, since her son requires one-to-one instruction.
""It feels like the school system is holding my son and my entire family hostage,"" Bosley-Smith said.
Thursday's news conference was not the first time families have expressed concern.
Four weeks ago, parents and students protested outside the Harford County Board of Education meeting, calling for in-person classes to resume. Days later, the school board voted to approve the virtual learning plan.
""Put our children over politics and make the right choice,"" Griffith said. ""Please stop telling us what can't be done and please work with us to tell us what we can do.""

65,/maryland/belair/mail-voting-maryland-deadlines-how-get-ballot,2020-08-26T18:27:09Z,"Mail-In Voting In Maryland: Deadlines, How To...",0,7,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — More than 500,000 mail-in ballots went uncounted during the 2020 primary season nationwide, many of them because they were deemed incomplete or because they arrived too late.
In Maryland, state election officials said nearly 35,000 ballots were rejected during the primary.
Of those, authorities said more than 30,000 ballots were received late and more than 3,000 did not have signatures.
The issue could grow: A record number of voters may stay away from traditional polling places for the Nov. 3 general election because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead cast their ballots by mail.
To help ensure your vote is among those tallied in Maryland, follow this checklist:
Note: Due to a change in law, the Maryland Board of Elections must use the terms ""mail-in ballot"" and ""mail-in voting"" rather than absentee ballot or absentee voting.
With guidelines changing in many states, more than 80 percent of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election, by far the most in U.S. history.
That's a result of 20 states loosening vote-by-mail laws this year due to the pandemic. As of Aug. 25, data from The Washington Post indicates 100 million people will be eligible to vote by mail either with no ""excuse"" or citing fears of the coronavirus as a reason. Among them, 51 million people will be automatically sent a ballot in the mail and 44 million people sent an application for a mail-in ballot.
Only six states still require a valid excuse other than coronavirus fears to vote by mail. Five states had already conducted elections solely by mail even before the pandemic.
Will your vote count?
In the primary election, a study by the Post showed 534,731 ballots were nixed in 23 states, and NPR found even more — 558,032 in 30 states — in a similar study. In New York City alone, more than 84,000 mail-in ballots were tossed and lawsuits were filed over the legitimacy of the outcomes of some close races.
Millions of people will cast their ballots by mail for the first time in the 2020 general election. Pew Research numbers show the number of people who vote by mail had already been on a sharp increase for years. In 2016, more than 20 percent of voters nationwide voted by mail, a total of about 27 million.
Of the 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, officials found 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people, according to Electronic Registration Information Center data analyzed by the Post. That equates to a 0.0025 percent fraud rate. The Brennan Center for Justice has described vote-by-mail fraud as ""infinitesimally small.""
Why are people concerned about a legitimate election with so few documented cases of actual fraud?
Partly, it's problems with the U.S. Postal Service. But equally troublesome are problems that exposed themselves during the primaries. The Post data shows more ballots were rejected in 23 states than the number of absentee ballot rejections reported in the 2016 general election nationwide, in large part because of mistakes in filling out the ballots.
That means a lot more opportunities for inexperienced mail-in voters to make mistakes — which Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says could pose a significant problem in the rejection rate come November.
""Experience matters,"" Smith told the Post. ""If you lack experience voting by mail, the odds of you casting a ballot that doesn't count will go up.""
To make sure your ballot is counted:
Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said if the election between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is close, the mail-in ballots will create ""a mess.""
""The two campaigns will be arguing over nonconforming ballots, which is going to run up against voters' beliefs in fair play,"" Stewart told the Post.
There's also growing concern over the governmental entity tasked with handling the influx of mail-in ballots.
The Postal Service has come under fire for increasingly slow service, mail backlogs and planned changes that some have feared will have an effect on their ability to handle the expected massive increase of mail-in ballots this year.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told senators on Capitol Hill in recent testimony he was unaware of certain changes at the Postal Service until they caused a public uproar. But he also said there are no plans to restore mailboxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed. His testimony raised fresh questions about how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of ballots for the November election.
In Maryland, vote-by-mail drop boxes will be installed so voters can avoid the lines at the polls and not have to worry about Postal Service issues. At least 200 drop boxes will be open until 8 p.m. on Nov. 3.

Among them were changes at the Main Street Tower and Upper Chesapeake Medical Center.
The Main Street Tower was granted permission for its rooftop deck to be used for outdoor dining. The proposal calls for a 1,658-square-foot outdoor dining area.
In September 2019, owner Renato Buontempo appeared before the Bel Air Planning Commission about a 2,311-square-foot outdoor dining area on the rooftop deck.
At that time, the Tower received authorization to update a railing and install a sound wall over the winter. The architect who presented the proposal described it as ""phase one"" of the deck project, for which he said planning began in early 2019. Buontempo and his architect were told they would need to come back to the board with a site plan outlining proposed use of the deck. The planning commission also stipulated that permits would be required for the deck, roof rails and outdoor dining.
At Thursday's hearing, the commission approved the site plan and special development request.
One other proposal before the commission was for an 11,000-square-foot addition to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center at 500 Upper Chesapeake Drive. The expansion would be on the support services part of the hospital. A site plan, landscape plan and special development request were approved.
Plans also got the green light for additions to the previously approved ambulatory surgical center at 515 South Tollgate Road. They include a 16,061-square-foot addition and 2,299-square-foot addition to the first floor, according to the planning commission. The surgical center will offer surgery in a less costly setting than a hospital and is designed to meet the needs of the community for more inpatient and outpatient beds with the future closure of Harford Memorial Hospital, Upper Chesapeake's representative said at previous hearing in November 2018 about the project."

People can respond to the census through Oct. 31 online, by phone or by mail.
The purpose of the once-each-decade count is to help determine where $1.5 trillion in federal funding goes and how many congressional seats each state gets.
If 20 percent of the population in Harford County does not get counted in 2020, government officials say the county would lose $93 million in federal funding per year.
The new coronavirus erupted just as the 2020 census was getting underway.
In the wake of mass layoffs and unprecedented economic damage, studies are projecting that more than 4 million people could be undercounted this year.
Should these households not respond, billions of dollars that fund crucial services before, during and after the coronavirus pandemic will be lost. Services include hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and dozens more.
Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.
Both the National Urban League and the NALEO Educational Fund have sounded the alarm that communities with large concentrations of black and Hispanic residents are trailing the rest of the nation in answering the 2020 questionnaire, the Associated Press reported.
A more detailed analysis of response rates in late May and early June conducted by the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center showed that neighborhoods with concentrations of black residents had a self-response rate of 51 percent, compared with 53.8 percent for Hispanic-concentrated neighborhoods and 65.5 percent for white-dominant neighborhoods.
These populations are also among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Young people and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, according to one study. So are women and people of color, Department of Labor data says.
This is causing outreach challenges for both the Census Bureau and organizations providing services to impacted communities.
The Census Bureau suspended field operations in March, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This also included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
The Census Bureau told the Associated Press that it had finished dropping off questionnaire forms in June to almost the 6.8 million mostly rural households across the country.
Organizations nationwide have put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media and telephone calls.
Because of the pandemic, the bureau pushed back the deadline for finishing the 2020 census from the end of July to the end of October, and it asked Congress for a delay in handing over apportionment and redistricting numbers.
Census officials have encouraged Americans to respond to the decennial survey online, a first for the census.
In a move designed to cut costs and keep up with digital lifestyles, the census questionnaire is available at my2020census.gov. Americans can access the online questionnaire by using a 12-digit ID code included with their census invitation sent by mail.
The 2020 census counts everyone living in the United States and its five territories. Learn more about how to respond to this year's census.

The National Association of Counties (NACo) has recognized Harford County in 2020 with two awards for innovative and effective county government programs. The county was honored with Achievement Awards for its Halloween costume workshop for children who use wheelchairs and the anti-drug Pledge Program for youth, presented in partnership with the Harford County Sheriff's Office.
The Glassman administration has earned a total of eleven NACo awards over the past five years.
""I would like to thank our community partners and sponsors, and our creative county employees, for these outstanding programs,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""Together we were able to help children learn early on about the dangers of drugs and alcohol and give all kids a chance to share in the joys of childhood.""
Halloween Costume Workshop
For some children who use a wheelchair, dressing up in a costume and trick-or-treating in their neighborhood can be a challenge. Traditional Halloween costumes often don't fit and the physical inaccessibility of neighborhoods leaves many children with disabilities home on that magical night. Imagine a place where every child who uses a wheelchair can not only trick or treat with their siblings and peers, but be the star of the evening in a unique costume designed specifically for them. In most communities around the country, this does not exist. In Harford County, Maryland it does.
Rachel Harbin in the Harford County Department of Community Services developed the region's first Wheelchair Costume Workshop, held at Ripken Stadium in October 2019. Over two days, more than 100 community volunteers designed, built and painted completely original costumes that fit securely on 12 children's wheelchairs. Once the costumes were fitted, the children joined over 300 children of all abilities for inclusive trick-or-treating at the stadium, providing an important example to the community that ALL children should be able to have fun, play with their peers, and enjoy Halloween! The Wheelchair Costume Workshop is an outstanding example of a public-private partnership—with over 30 local businesses and community organizations coming together to provide volunteers, donate building materials, and sponsor trick or treat stations.
Pledge Program
The Pledge Program was developed by Tara Lathrop in Harford County government's Office of Drug Control Policy and by the Harford County Sheriff's Office. The program for children ages 8 to 11 years old educates young people before they are exposed to substances and trains them to use refusal skills to resist drugs and alcohol. The interactive program incorporates guest speakers, including a doctor, an individual in recovery, and a parent who has lost a child to drug use. Children also have the opportunity to participate in role play scenarios with local high school theater students to experience mock-peer pressure and practice refusal skills. Another important component of the Pledge Program is the participation of parents and guardians. Parents and caregivers are provided topics to discuss with youth to continue the conversation at home and encourage discussion among family members. Since its inception in January 2019, the Pledge Program has partnered with five Harford County elementary schools with a total of 153 participants. Each participant received training and information that help expand their understanding of drugs and drug use in order to make positive and healthy choices in the future.
""Our community has been rocked by addiction and the overwhelming loss of life to opioid overdoses,"" Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said. ""It isn't enough to lock up dealers, we must find a way to prevent the overdoses from occurring. When Sgt. Aaron Penman approached me with the idea of the Pledge Program, it was an easy 'yes' from me. We know that early intervention is the key to preventing drug use and this program offers us one more tool to prevention and reaching our most vulnerable population, our children. I am exceedingly proud of this program, our partnerships to get this accomplished, and for the young people who are so willing to participate and learn."""

It is one of 17 MVA offices that will open following the months-long closure due to the coronavirus.
Appointments are required to go to the MVA branches that are open to minimize the amount of people in the building at one time.
Those who had to reschedule appointments that had been canceled due to the closure are prioritized first. By order of the governor, the MVA shut down all branches to in-person services March 20. Although the governor enabled these to be extended due to the state of emergency, these cases are prioritized by the MVA first.
Gov. Larry Hogan ordered extensions for driver's licenses, ID cards, permits and registrations that expire March 12 through the state of emergency, and they will not expire until 30 days after the state of emergency is lifted. Currently the state of emergency remains in effect in Maryland.
These services will be available by making an appointment online: learner's permits, commercial driving tests, non-commercial driving tests, driver's license and identification card renewal and title work.
Here are the locations that will open Monday, June 8:
New requirements will be in place at the entryway, in the office itself and at each work station.
Before both customers and employees enter, they must participate in a brief health screening.
Plexiglass dividers will separate work stations inside the MVA office.

In the building, social distancing markers will indicate where people should stand to allow an adequate amount of space between one another.

""We are making the necessary adjustments to our procedures to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and customers,"" MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer said in a statement.
""We appreciate our customers' patience during the closure and look forward to providing premier customer service whether you complete a transaction through our eStore, kiosks, mail-in processes or in person at our branch offices,"" Nizer said.
People can renew registrations, change their address, make insurance compliance payments and get information on flag fees online at mva.maryland.gov.
Since it closed its offices in late March, the MVA reports it has processed more than 740,000 transactions online.

In stage two, most businesses that were deemed nonessential can reopen, such as nail salons, real estate offices and law offices, among others. In addition, Harford Transit will begin taking requests for on-demand service.
""This is a gradual step forward for businesses with specifics posted on the governor's website,"" Glassman said in a statement.
As additional businesses open and services become available, Glassman said he and health officials were tracking the data around the coronavirus. Cases in Harford County are ""relatively low,"" Glassman said Friday.
""Locally, new cases and fatalities are trending downward; testing is increasing; hospital and ICU capacities appear adequate in case of a surge, and contact tracing is expanding,"" Glassman said. ""I continue to work closely with the Harford County Health Department as we monitor key metrics that guide our reopening to the extent permitted by Gov. Hogan.""
There are 939 confirmed cases of the virus in Harford County, according to state health officials. A total of 48 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and three others are believed to have died from the virus, with test results pending.
""Two nursing homes continue to represent more than half of reported fatalities,"" Glassman said. There have been 26 resident deaths in congregate living facilities. He advised those of all ages to continue to keep 6 feet between one another.
""Everyone is encouraged to continue social distancing and wearing face masks inside public places,"" Glassman said. ""While some employees can return to work, the governor has urged those who can telework to continue doing so.""
Harford Transit will accept applications for on-demand services starting Monday, according to Glassman, in accordance with the state's plan for gradually reopening public transportation. Fixed-route service remains suspended until further notice.

County officials will begin accepting applications on June 10. Applications and information about the grant programs can be found on the Harford County website.
The grants are being offered to business owners who run small operations that do not meet the standards for either the county's $7,500 business grant or the $2,500 farm grant program. Larger businesses may apply for the $5,000 grant program but city officials are attempting to reserve funds for small businesses.
In an email Wednesday, Harford County spokeswoman Cindy Mumby said that the $7,500 grant program is designated for small businesses with 2-50 employees while the $2,500 program is for farms with 10-plus acres, which. began May 26 and the first handful of payments have already gone out.
The county received 700 applications for the two previous grant programs and expect to be sending payments out to 150-200 applicants per week until all qualified applicants have been paid, Mumby wrote.
Mumby note that County Executive Barry Glassman's goal with all of these programs is to get help to the county's business community as soon as possible. There are no requirements for the minimum number of employees to qualify for the grant program.
""There are plenty of mom-and-pop businesses who do not have two employees, and we did not want to leave them out,"" Mumby told The Baltimore Sun.
According to county officials, the funds will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. The grants will be paid out of the county's first round of CARES funding, which is about $22 million.
County officials said that the $5,000 grant can only be used for commercial mortgages, rent or leases."

The executive order takes effect at 5 p.m. Friday, May 29, concurrent with the order Gov. Larry Hogan issued permitting restaurants and bars to serve patrons outside.
In announcing that outdoor dining would be allowed once again in Maryland, the governor called upon the leaders of local jurisdictions to work with businesses to reopen.
""We love the idea of closing streets for outside seating in Little Italy and Fells Point in Baltimore City, on West Street and Main Street in Annapolis, on Bethesda Row and in other towns across the state,"" Hogan said during a news conference Wednesday where he announced the relaxation of requirements. Hogan said he was ""strongly encouraging local leaders to find innovative ways to help support our restaurant businesses.""
The executive order that Glassman signed Thursday gives restaurants more space in their parking lots for outside dining by waiving several provisions of Harford County code, including those that have to do with off-street parking requirements, temporary uses, setbacks, seating capacity, outdoor displays, premise signage and outdoor storage.
""This action will make it easier for restaurants to offer outside dining, similar to my prior Executive Order facilitating outdoor retail sales,"" Glassman said in a statement. ""As with each step in reopening, everyone must follow required safety precautions so we can continue moving forward together.""

The new order from the governor allows restaurants and bars to serve food and drinks to customers in outdoor areas if they meet the following requirements:
Hogan also said restaurants should offer disposable, single-use menus or sanitize reusable menus between each seating, screen staff through daily temperature checks and train staff members in current COVID-19 guidelines.
The new outdoor dining guidance applies to restaurants and bars as well as social and fraternal clubs, including American Legion posts, VFW posts and Elks Clubs.

Larry Hogan announced his plan to lift the stay-at-home order at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland, he followed by saying local leaders had the capacity to determine whether that was appropriate for their jurisdictions. County Executive Barry Glassman plans for Harford County to fall into alignment with the governor's orders.
""I am pleased to announce that in consultation with our health officer, Harford County will reopen on Friday at 5 p.m. as outlined in Gov.

We have sacrificed to get to this point, and we must keep working together to maintain our progress. Be smart, stay safe and God bless.""
The governor said he would be lifting the stay-at-home order and enacting ""Safer-at-Home"" guidance, which recommends people stay home but allows businesses, factories and religious facilities to reopen, with some measures built in to protect public health.
For example, churches may open but can only do so at 50 percent capacity and are encouraged to hold services outside. Businesses are asked to put down markings to promote social distancing and post signage advising customers not to enter if they are sick.
The recovery plan offers a ""flexible, community-based approach,"" Hogan said, that empowers local leaders to control the timing of the reopening in their individual jurisdictions.
Under the governor's direction, the following would take effect at 5 p.m. Friday:
The new guidance says that local jurisdictions must consult with their health officers to determine whether it is appropriate to open outdoor public spaces, and it allows each jurisdiction to decide if it is safe for certain businesses, organizations, establishments and facilities to open.

N/A
The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our district is access to affordable health care. That is why we must pass Medicare for All; it will eliminate costly medical bills, deductibles, co-pays, and premiums while expanding access to include coverage for hearing, vision, dental, mental health care and long-term care.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Yes, I support Black Lives Matter.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
I think the term is incorrect for ""defund the police."" What it should be about is first recognizing that systemic racism is real in almost all systems in society.
Then, we must realize that too many duties have fallen onto police officers, spreading them too thin. It's really about reallocation of resources so that police can police, and not be social workers, doctors, etc.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
I think that there has been a failed national response from this administration. Over 215,000 Americans dead. That is a result of an inadequate and inept attempt of a response to a deadly virus. My opponent has spread misinformation about the coronavirus, and even took part in a ""Re-Open Maryland"" rally where people did not wear masks.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Unlike my opponent, I believe in equality and equity for everyone. Andy Harris has shown time and time again that he does not support equality as evidence by his votes against The Equality Act, the Deborah Sampson Act, The Violence Against Women Act, and The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act. The Human Rights Campaign named my opponent as one of the most ""anti-equality"" legislators in the United States. Mia has a long history of working and advocating for Civil Rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign, the MMAA, and the National Center for Transgender Equality.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the district?
My opponent voted against our communities in every way. He's voted against LGBT rights, women's rights, our veterans, our health care and our environment.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Investing in sustainable infrastructure and transitioning to a clean energy economy. Not only would it be better for the planet, but it would create thousands of jobs that provide a living-wage.
The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and is vital for our economy and way of life. We must protect our waters and the environment from further pollution and work to restore the bay to its natural wonder.
Expanding equality and equity to prevent discrimination of any person.
Rural communities are the backbone of America. Here in Maryland, we need to value and protect our rural environments, schools, infrastructure and economies.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My 20 years of military experience and military awards are evidence that I can handle this job. I am up to the task of serving this country.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

The passage of Medicare for All.

Why should voters trust you?

I served our country for 20 years, and I am prepared to continuing serving our country by representing Maryland's 1st district. Also, I do not accept money from corporate PACs, so I am not beholden to any big money donors. I don't have anyone to answer to except the voters themselves.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

Fiscal policy should be aimed at enhancing inclusion and power of the middle class. Taxes are necessary as long as the people know they are going to things that help them. When someone sees that they are paying money into Medicare through a tax but they pay nothing when they go to the doctor's, they know that it's going to something real.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No, I intend to serve the full term.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Join the Navy, not the Army, and learn to understand what good leadership and mentorship is when helping others."

Previous or Current Elected or Appointed Office
Congressman 2011-present
The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
COVID - We need to protect the vulnerable, open up the economy as much as possible, and continue to fund Operation Warp Speed to deliver treatments and a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible, so that we can put this pandemic behind us.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
I do not support the Black Lives Matter organization - it is a socialist/communist front organization - but I do support the drive for equal treatment of everyone in front of the law. I always support peaceful protest - but never looting or violence.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
We have to increase, not decrease or de-fund the police.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
Now that the World Health Organization has said that shutdowns should not be the primary way to prevent the spread, we should re-open the economy ASAP, while protecting the vulnerable until a vaccine is produced. We do not need a nationwide mask mandate.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a conservative, and I live in the district. My opponent is supported by Hollywood liberals like Amy Schumer, and she has never lived in the First District.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Reduce taxes, cut regulation to get our economy going. Make sure that everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions, has access to affordable health care and insurance, without a mandate.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have helped important industries in the district, like farmers, seafood processors, poultry growers, watermen, and the tourism industry during my term in Congress.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

Getting our economy back to the great pre-COVID economy we had, including bringing down unemployment to historically low levels again.

Why should voters trust you?

Because I listen. I have held over 100 live and virtual town halls since I have been in office.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

We have to remember that Congress spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars, not their own - and that we are so far in debt that we are really spending our grandchildren's money at this point. We have to restrain federal spending when COVID is over.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Listen, don't speak.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I have been honored to serve as the representative of the First District, and I ask for your vote again."

Harford County relies entirely on volunteers for its fire service, and has a combination of volunteer and paid EMS providers operating in 12 volunteer companies countywide. Harford's student loan repayment program was created by County Executive Barry Glassman, a former EMT with the Level Volunteer Fire Company, to recruit and retain public safety volunteers.
The program, known as Harford's NEXT GEN Responder, is believed to be the first of its kind in Maryland.
""In addition to working paid jobs or school, our volunteer fire & EMS providers have to meet
increasingly rigorous training standards at the same time they're volunteering countless hours to
save lives in our community,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""As it gets more difficult each year to attract younger volunteers, we hope this program will strengthen our fire & EMS service and show Harford County's support for these local heroes.""
Anyone with student loans, including recent graduates and college students majoring in any field of study, is eligible for the program. To qualify, they must be a volunteer member of a Harford County VFC or ambulance company and earn 50 points in the LOSAP - or Length of Service Award Program - for qualifying service activities in the twelve months beginning on October 1 each year.

Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order allowing indoor operations to increase from 50 to 75 percent capacity, effective at 5 p.m. Monday, Sept. 21.
Buffets are still not allowed, and neither is serving patrons who are not seated.
Appropriate physical distancing and other precautions will be required to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Hogan's executive order states that retailers, religious facilities and restaurants may all operate at 75 percent capacity.
The state guidance can be tailored for each jurisdiction. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County remain under tighter restrictions than the rest of Maryland.
Increasing capacity at indoor dining establishments coincides with the state's first Maryland Restaurant Week, which is Sept. 18 through Sept. 27 and is in partnership with the Restaurant Association of Maryland and Visit Maryland.
""Restaurants in Maryland are pleased that the Governor has heard their concerns and has increased indoor dining capacity to 75 percent,"" President/CEO of the Restaurant Association of Maryland Marshall Weston said in a statement.
""The weather will soon eliminate outdoor dining as a viable option and the increase of indoor capacity will help make up for that loss,"" Weston said. ""We encourage all counties to follow the governor's executive order and not delay implementation. Restaurants will continue to serve their customers safely even with these increased capacities.""
The goal is to give businesses a boost after economic fallout from the virus, Hogan said.
""This is a perfect time to enjoy going to your favorite restaurant or trying a new place to show your support on behalf of the Maryland restaurant industry,"" according to a statement from the governor's office, which said: ""By joining together in support of this effort, Marylanders will be giving a much-needed boost to restaurants recovering from coronavirus-related restrictions while helping food service employees and their community.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Harford County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year.
Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in 2016, working with ProPublica to bring you information about vandalism at one polling place in Baltimore and a missing ballot page at another, broken scanners at the polls in New York, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail-in ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences.

90,/maryland/belair/virtual-school-harford-county-families-lawmakers-push-back,2020-09-03T13:00:52Z,"Virtual School In Harford County: Families,...",0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — Maryland State Delegate Mike Griffith is one of several parents calling upon Harford County Public Schools to offer families options other than all-virtual learning as the start of the school year approaches. Under the current plan, students in Harford County Public Schools will receive instruction remotely when the fall semester begins Tuesday, Sept. 8.
""This is an issue that impacts students from every corner of our county,"" Griffith said, speaking at a news conference he organized Thursday near Red Pump Elementary School to draw attention to the problems caused by the current path forward.
""The proposed plan will have negative effects on students with special needs, students in rural areas, students of low-income areas,"" Griffith said, ""and of course their families.""
Griffith said he worked with superintendent and governor to apply for CARES Act funding to pay for personal protective equipment for the school system ""to help get our kids in school soon."" He asked Harford County Public Schools to provide families with a choice.
""We have advocated for — at the very least — a hybrid model that allows choice for parents and teachers alike, as many students have shown in-person learning is vital,"" said Griffith.
His son, a 6-year-old who has severe autism, ""suffered significantly"" since the spring and has ""benefited significantly"" from in-person instruction at Hickory Elementary School, he said.
For students in the younger grades, in particular, there are hurdles at the outset of the semester. Due to a device shortage, kindergarten through third-grade students will not have school system-issued laptops. Their parents were told to pick up packets at their schools and have been instructed they will need to teach them, Griffith said.
Susanne Reiter of Bel Air said the ""11th-hour request"" made Aug. 28 for families to come up with their own devices left her household ""scrambling"" to purchase two overpriced Chromebooks.
She and her husband spent $1,036 — the equivalent of six part-time shifts for her husband or her entire biweekly paycheck — so her sons would have laptops, she said.
The school system offered a ""mountain of excuses,"" according to Reiter, who asked Thursday for school system leaders to provide a ""clear and reasonable explanation of its plan going forward.""
State Sen. Jason Gallian, whose daughters are in kindergarten and first grade, said his are among the 15,000 Harford County Public Schools students starting classes without Chromebooks. Gallian said he was concerned about disenfranchising lower-income students and financially burdening parents — who are taxpayers — to shoulder the cost of getting laptops themselves. Connectivity issues in parts of Harford County was also problematic, he said.
""Thousands of families in the county do not have access to high-speed internet,"" Gallian said. ""Teaching is completely ineffective if the internet connection is lost.""
Gov. Larry Hogan and State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon said schools should make plans to bring students back to physical classrooms and offered funding to those that moved forward in the first quarter toward in-person learning, at an Aug. 27 news conference.
""Following the governor's announcement last week, I encourage our school officials to get our children back in chool as soon and safely as possible,"" Gallian said Thursday, Sept. 3.
About 5 percent of students will attend Learning Support Centers at school buildings, according to Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson.
""HCPS' Learning Support Centers are the first step to returning students to school buildings,"" Bulson said.
Senators Bob Cassilly, Gallion and J.B. Jennings as well as Delegates Kathy Szeliga, Teresa Reilly, Susan McComas and Lauren Arikan as well as Griffith signed a letter to Harford County Public Schools Aug. 27 asking that school officials ""revisit their decision"" to hold the first semester online and to give families and teachers a choice about whether to return to the classroom.
""Many students have not opened a textbook since March, and extending that arrangement for another semester is unthinkable,"" the elected officials wrote. ""We are very concerned that the adopted plan for remote learning fails to meet even the basic educational needs of far too many students.""
They said they had heard from ""countless parents"" whose children struggled with the remote learning setup in the spring, after schools closed in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Maryland's positivity rate for the coronavirus has been under 5 percent since June 25, Hogan said, which is the recommended benchmark for reopening. In Harford County, the positivity rate was 3.97 percent as of Tuesday, Sept. 1, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
""The virus is not circulating widely in the community,"" Harford County Councilman Chad Shrodes said at Thursday's news conference. The positivity rate ""has remained under 4 percent for two consecutive weeks"" in Harford County, he said.
""If we begin the year with schools closed or at only 5 percent of their capacity, we are falsely led to assume that this is our only safe option,"" Gallion said. ""It is an uncontrolled experiement supported supported by incomplete data.""
Said Gallion: ""Returning to schools carries little risk, yet keeping them closed costs our students and our communities dearly and causes great harm, potentially a lifetime of damage for some children.""
One was the son of Amanda Bosley-Smith of Forest Hill.
It has been ""debilitating"" for her son — who has autism, is nonverbal and suffers from anxiety — to function without school for five months, she said. Since March when schools closed, he has regressed into self harming behaviors, according to his mother, who said his year-round school was not meeting.
""This abandonment is not only detrimental in the short term,"" Bosley-Smith said, but ""will affect him for the rest of his life.""
It has also negatively impacted everyone in her family, since her son requires one-to-one instruction.
""It feels like the school system is holding my son and my entire family hostage,"" Bosley-Smith said.
Thursday's news conference was not the first time families have expressed concern.
Four weeks ago, parents and students protested outside the Harford County Board of Education meeting, calling for in-person classes to resume. Days later, the school board voted to approve the virtual learning plan.
""Put our children over politics and make the right choice,"" Griffith said. ""Please stop telling us what can't be done and please work with us to tell us what we can do.""

92,/maryland/belair/mail-voting-maryland-deadlines-how-get-ballot,2020-08-26T18:27:09Z,"Mail-In Voting In Maryland: Deadlines, How To...",0,7,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — More than 500,000 mail-in ballots went uncounted during the 2020 primary season nationwide, many of them because they were deemed incomplete or because they arrived too late.
In Maryland, state election officials said nearly 35,000 ballots were rejected during the primary.
Of those, authorities said more than 30,000 ballots were received late and more than 3,000 did not have signatures.
The issue could grow: A record number of voters may stay away from traditional polling places for the Nov. 3 general election because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead cast their ballots by mail.
To help ensure your vote is among those tallied in Maryland, follow this checklist:
Note: Due to a change in law, the Maryland Board of Elections must use the terms ""mail-in ballot"" and ""mail-in voting"" rather than absentee ballot or absentee voting.
With guidelines changing in many states, more than 80 percent of all American voters will be eligible to receive a ballot in the mail for the 2020 election, by far the most in U.S. history.
That's a result of 20 states loosening vote-by-mail laws this year due to the pandemic. As of Aug. 25, data from The Washington Post indicates 100 million people will be eligible to vote by mail either with no ""excuse"" or citing fears of the coronavirus as a reason. Among them, 51 million people will be automatically sent a ballot in the mail and 44 million people sent an application for a mail-in ballot.
Only six states still require a valid excuse other than coronavirus fears to vote by mail. Five states had already conducted elections solely by mail even before the pandemic.
Will your vote count?
In the primary election, a study by the Post showed 534,731 ballots were nixed in 23 states, and NPR found even more — 558,032 in 30 states — in a similar study. In New York City alone, more than 84,000 mail-in ballots were tossed and lawsuits were filed over the legitimacy of the outcomes of some close races.
Millions of people will cast their ballots by mail for the first time in the 2020 general election. Pew Research numbers show the number of people who vote by mail had already been on a sharp increase for years. In 2016, more than 20 percent of voters nationwide voted by mail, a total of about 27 million.
Of the 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, officials found 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people, according to Electronic Registration Information Center data analyzed by the Post. That equates to a 0.0025 percent fraud rate. The Brennan Center for Justice has described vote-by-mail fraud as ""infinitesimally small.""
Why are people concerned about a legitimate election with so few documented cases of actual fraud?
Partly, it's problems with the U.S. Postal Service. But equally troublesome are problems that exposed themselves during the primaries. The Post data shows more ballots were rejected in 23 states than the number of absentee ballot rejections reported in the 2016 general election nationwide, in large part because of mistakes in filling out the ballots.
That means a lot more opportunities for inexperienced mail-in voters to make mistakes — which Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida, says could pose a significant problem in the rejection rate come November.
""Experience matters,"" Smith told the Post. ""If you lack experience voting by mail, the odds of you casting a ballot that doesn't count will go up.""
To make sure your ballot is counted:
Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said if the election between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden is close, the mail-in ballots will create ""a mess.""
""The two campaigns will be arguing over nonconforming ballots, which is going to run up against voters' beliefs in fair play,"" Stewart told the Post.
There's also growing concern over the governmental entity tasked with handling the influx of mail-in ballots.
The Postal Service has come under fire for increasingly slow service, mail backlogs and planned changes that some have feared will have an effect on their ability to handle the expected massive increase of mail-in ballots this year.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told senators on Capitol Hill in recent testimony he was unaware of certain changes at the Postal Service until they caused a public uproar. But he also said there are no plans to restore mailboxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed. His testimony raised fresh questions about how the Postal Service will ensure timely delivery of ballots for the November election.
In Maryland, vote-by-mail drop boxes will be installed so voters can avoid the lines at the polls and not have to worry about Postal Service issues. At least 200 drop boxes will be open until 8 p.m. on Nov. 3.

Among them were changes at the Main Street Tower and Upper Chesapeake Medical Center.
The Main Street Tower was granted permission for its rooftop deck to be used for outdoor dining. The proposal calls for a 1,658-square-foot outdoor dining area.
In September 2019, owner Renato Buontempo appeared before the Bel Air Planning Commission about a 2,311-square-foot outdoor dining area on the rooftop deck.
At that time, the Tower received authorization to update a railing and install a sound wall over the winter. The architect who presented the proposal described it as ""phase one"" of the deck project, for which he said planning began in early 2019. Buontempo and his architect were told they would need to come back to the board with a site plan outlining proposed use of the deck. The planning commission also stipulated that permits would be required for the deck, roof rails and outdoor dining.
At Thursday's hearing, the commission approved the site plan and special development request.
One other proposal before the commission was for an 11,000-square-foot addition to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center at 500 Upper Chesapeake Drive. The expansion would be on the support services part of the hospital. A site plan, landscape plan and special development request were approved.
Plans also got the green light for additions to the previously approved ambulatory surgical center at 515 South Tollgate Road. They include a 16,061-square-foot addition and 2,299-square-foot addition to the first floor, according to the planning commission. The surgical center will offer surgery in a less costly setting than a hospital and is designed to meet the needs of the community for more inpatient and outpatient beds with the future closure of Harford Memorial Hospital, Upper Chesapeake's representative said at previous hearing in November 2018 about the project."

95,/maryland/belair/census-response-harford-county-2nd-highest-maryland,2020-06-27T13:31:00Z,How Much Of Harford County Has Responded To Census,0,1,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"HARFORD COUNTY, MD — Nearly two out of every five U.S. households nationwide have yet to respond to the U.S. Census, stoking fears that billions of federal dollars could be left on the table — dollars that fund crucial services including during the pandemic. Harford County has the third-highest response rate to the U.S. Census in Maryland.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's self-response map, 73.7 households in Harford County have responded to this year's census either online, by phone or by mail.
Nationally, about 61.5 percent of households have responded as of June 26; and in Maryland, 65.7 percent have responded to the census.
This means more than three out of every 10 households in Maryland have not yet been counted.
Here are the counties with the highest response rates in Maryland as of June 26:
People can respond to the census through Oct. 31 online, by phone or by mail.
The purpose of the once-each-decade count is to help determine where $1.5 trillion in federal funding goes and how many congressional seats each state gets.
If 20 percent of the population in Harford County does not get counted in 2020, government officials say the county would lose $93 million in federal funding per year.
The new coronavirus erupted just as the 2020 census was getting underway.
In the wake of mass layoffs and unprecedented economic damage, studies are projecting that more than 4 million people could be undercounted this year.
Should these households not respond, billions of dollars that fund crucial services before, during and after the coronavirus pandemic will be lost. Services include hospitals, Head Start programs, school lunches and summer lunch programs, Medicaid, food stamps and dozens more.
Historically, people of color, children, senior citizens, undocumented immigrants, people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Native Americans in tribal areas, the homeless and low-income people are among the least likely to be counted accurately in the census.
Both the National Urban League and the NALEO Educational Fund have sounded the alarm that communities with large concentrations of black and Hispanic residents are trailing the rest of the nation in answering the 2020 questionnaire, the Associated Press reported.
A more detailed analysis of response rates in late May and early June conducted by the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center showed that neighborhoods with concentrations of black residents had a self-response rate of 51 percent, compared with 53.8 percent for Hispanic-concentrated neighborhoods and 65.5 percent for white-dominant neighborhoods.
These populations are also among the hardest hit by the pandemic.
Young people and low-income workers are bearing the brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, according to one study. So are women and people of color, Department of Labor data says.
This is causing outreach challenges for both the Census Bureau and organizations providing services to impacted communities.
The Census Bureau suspended field operations in March, pulling workers off the streets to protect them from the virus. This also included efforts to drop off census forms at households in rural areas with no traditional addresses.
Workers didn't return until May 4 as part of a phased restart.
The Census Bureau told the Associated Press that it had finished dropping off questionnaire forms in June to almost the 6.8 million mostly rural households across the country.
Organizations nationwide have put in-person outreach on hold. Plans to set up booths at farmers markets and work with child care centers have been abandoned, replaced by digital advertising, social media and telephone calls.
Because of the pandemic, the bureau pushed back the deadline for finishing the 2020 census from the end of July to the end of October, and it asked Congress for a delay in handing over apportionment and redistricting numbers.

The National Association of Counties (NACo) has recognized Harford County in 2020 with two awards for innovative and effective county government programs. The county was honored with Achievement Awards for its Halloween costume workshop for children who use wheelchairs and the anti-drug Pledge Program for youth, presented in partnership with the Harford County Sheriff's Office.
The Glassman administration has earned a total of eleven NACo awards over the past five years.
""I would like to thank our community partners and sponsors, and our creative county employees, for these outstanding programs,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""Together we were able to help children learn early on about the dangers of drugs and alcohol and give all kids a chance to share in the joys of childhood.""
Halloween Costume Workshop
For some children who use a wheelchair, dressing up in a costume and trick-or-treating in their neighborhood can be a challenge. Traditional Halloween costumes often don't fit and the physical inaccessibility of neighborhoods leaves many children with disabilities home on that magical night. Imagine a place where every child who uses a wheelchair can not only trick or treat with their siblings and peers, but be the star of the evening in a unique costume designed specifically for them. In most communities around the country, this does not exist. In Harford County, Maryland it does.
Rachel Harbin in the Harford County Department of Community Services developed the region's first Wheelchair Costume Workshop, held at Ripken Stadium in October 2019. Over two days, more than 100 community volunteers designed, built and painted completely original costumes that fit securely on 12 children's wheelchairs. Once the costumes were fitted, the children joined over 300 children of all abilities for inclusive trick-or-treating at the stadium, providing an important example to the community that ALL children should be able to have fun, play with their peers, and enjoy Halloween! The Wheelchair Costume Workshop is an outstanding example of a public-private partnership—with over 30 local businesses and community organizations coming together to provide volunteers, donate building materials, and sponsor trick or treat stations.
Pledge Program
The Pledge Program was developed by Tara Lathrop in Harford County government's Office of Drug Control Policy and by the Harford County Sheriff's Office. The program for children ages 8 to 11 years old educates young people before they are exposed to substances and trains them to use refusal skills to resist drugs and alcohol. The interactive program incorporates guest speakers, including a doctor, an individual in recovery, and a parent who has lost a child to drug use. Children also have the opportunity to participate in role play scenarios with local high school theater students to experience mock-peer pressure and practice refusal skills. Another important component of the Pledge Program is the participation of parents and guardians. Parents and caregivers are provided topics to discuss with youth to continue the conversation at home and encourage discussion among family members. Since its inception in January 2019, the Pledge Program has partnered with five Harford County elementary schools with a total of 153 participants. Each participant received training and information that help expand their understanding of drugs and drug use in order to make positive and healthy choices in the future.
""Our community has been rocked by addiction and the overwhelming loss of life to opioid overdoses,"" Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R. Gahler said. ""It isn't enough to lock up dealers, we must find a way to prevent the overdoses from occurring. When Sgt. Aaron Penman approached me with the idea of the Pledge Program, it was an easy 'yes' from me. We know that early intervention is the key to preventing drug use and this program offers us one more tool to prevention and reaching our most vulnerable population, our children. I am exceedingly proud of this program, our partnerships to get this accomplished, and for the young people who are so willing to participate and learn."""

98,/maryland/belair/bel-air-mva-office-reopen-monday-june-8,2020-06-08T01:02:31Z,Bel Air MVA Office To Reopen Monday,0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — The Motor Vehicle Administration branch in Bel Air will reopen Monday as part of the stage two reopening plan in Maryland. It is one of 17 MVA offices that will open following the months-long closure due to the coronavirus.
Appointments are required to go to the MVA branches that are open to minimize the amount of people in the building at one time.
Those who had to reschedule appointments that had been canceled due to the closure are prioritized first. By order of the governor, the MVA shut down all branches to in-person services March 20. Although the governor enabled these to be extended due to the state of emergency, these cases are prioritized by the MVA first.
Gov. Larry Hogan ordered extensions for driver's licenses, ID cards, permits and registrations that expire March 12 through the state of emergency, and they will not expire until 30 days after the state of emergency is lifted. Currently the state of emergency remains in effect in Maryland.
These services will be available by making an appointment online: learner's permits, commercial driving tests, non-commercial driving tests, driver's license and identification card renewal and title work.
Here are the locations that will open Monday, June 8:
New requirements will be in place at the entryway, in the office itself and at each work station.
Before both customers and employees enter, they must participate in a brief health screening.
Plexiglass dividers will separate work stations inside the MVA office.

In the building, social distancing markers will indicate where people should stand to allow an adequate amount of space between one another.

""We are making the necessary adjustments to our procedures to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our employees and customers,"" MVA Administrator Chrissy Nizer said in a statement.
""We appreciate our customers' patience during the closure and look forward to providing premier customer service whether you complete a transaction through our eStore, kiosks, mail-in processes or in person at our branch offices,"" Nizer said.
People can renew registrations, change their address, make insurance compliance payments and get information on flag fees online at mva.maryland.gov.
Since it closed its offices in late March, the MVA reports it has processed more than 740,000 transactions online.

100,/maryland/belair/new-covid-rules-md-ahead-anticipated-hospital-surge,2020-11-17T19:49:38Z,New COVID Rules In MD Ahead Of Anticipated...,0,28,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"MARYLAND — Hospitals, businesses and nursing homes are subject to new orders to address the recent surge in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said at a news conference Tuesday.
""We are in a war right now, and the virus is winning,"" Hogan said. ""Now more than ever I'm pleading with the people of our state to stand together a while longer to help us battle this surging virus.""
As of Tuesday, state heath officials reported 4,186 people in Maryland have died from COVID-19.
""Twenty-six Marylanders died yesterday. That's more than one dying every hour in Maryland,"" Hogan said. ""We've lost more Marylanders to COVID-19 than we lose each year to car accidents, gun violence and the flu combined.""
Currently 1,046 people are hospitalized in the state due to COVID-19, according to authorities.
""Maryland hospitals are now reaching capacity,"" Hogan said Tuesday. ""We are very concerned that hospitals in western Maryland, for example, are already at their capacity limit, and 19 hospitals across the state are above 90 percent capacity.""
Even with the 6,000 beds provided for under the state's hospital surge plan, hospitals are at a critical point. Hogan noted Garrett and Allegany counties were particularly strained.
""To prevent the overburdening of our health care system and to stop more Marylanders from dying,"" the governor said immediate action was required.
To alleviate overcrowding, the Maryland Department of Health issued an emergency order enabling hospitals at or near capacity to transfer patients to other hospitals that can provide care.
""Currently, individual hospitals need to go critical care bed shopping — that usually takes place within their own medical system, ignoring available beds that maybe exist actually relatively close to them,"" according to Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician in chief at the R Adams Cowley University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center.
""Now a single phone call will give them access"" to facilities regardless of affiliation, Scalea said. ""This is about getting the right patient to the right place in the right amount of time to receive the correct level of medical care.""
Added Scalea: ""I'm certain that it will improve ICU bed flow as we anticipate a large number of critically ill patients.""
Several new orders will also take effect impacting hospitals, restaurants and nursing homes:
Hogan encouraged wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus and reminded Marylanders that a statewide executive order around face coverings remains in effect. It requires wearing a mask in any public indoor facility across the state and on public transportation as well as in outdoor public spaces where it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of 6 feet.
""The single best mitigation strategy that we have to fight the virus"" is wearing a mask, Hogan said. ""It's not a limitation on your right to infect other people, but it is the best way to keep you and your family members safe, to keep people out of the hospital and to save lives,"" Hogan said. ""We remain in a state of emergency.""
The developments come as the state and nation deal with a rapid increase in new COVID-19 cases.
""The sad reality is that all across America, more people are getting infected with COVID-19, more are being hospitalized, more are going into intensive care and more people are dying,"" Hogan said.
The country broke a record for coronavirus-related hospitalizations Monday with more than 73,000 Americans hospitalized, he added.
""All across the country, this virus is spiking out of control at a rate much worse than it was in the spring,"" Hogan said.
Maryland broke a record for its single-day case increase on Saturday, when 2,321 new infections were confirmed. Tuesday saw the second-highest increase, with 2,149 new cases reported.
For the latest updates on the coronavirus in Maryland, get Patch news alerts.
In response to a spike in cases, Hogan last week restricted capacity at restaurants from 75 to 50 percent. State health officials advised against indoor gatherings of more than 25 and travel to certain states.
At Tuesday's news conference, Hogan asked Marylanders to get tested for the virus if they were going to see family members for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. In particular, he called on college students planning to return home, anyone visiting an older relative and those returning from out-of-state travel to get tested. Visit covidtest.maryland.gov for testing locations.
Several jurisdictions have added further restrictions in the past week: Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Harford County, Howard County, Montgomery County and Prince George's County.

The measures come as cases have spiked in the past two weeks.
Harford County will put out drop boxes for documents and payments at 220 S. Main Street in Bel Air while county buildings are closed. Officials say Harford County government will remain open for business as county employees who are authorized to telework will do so until further notice.
Organized activities will be suspended at county parks until further notice, and some parks and recreation programming has been moved online.
County parks will remain open, and social distancing is required.
Modified service will be in place for Harford Transit.
The new measures will take effect at 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 13, in response to a spike in coronavirus cases in Harford County.
State health officials say 4,329 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Harford County as of Thursday, Nov. 12.
The coronavirus case rate is 25.82 per 100,000 people as of Thursday in Harford County, compared with 7.27 the day before Halloween, officials said.
When an area exceeds 10 new cases per 100,000, community spread has accelerated and is at dangerous levels, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. If the case rate is greater than 25, officials say community spread is out of control and may require measures to curb the infection.
""Public safety is my top priority in responding to this recent surge, and my long-term goal is to keep our economy and government services open for business,"" County Executive Barry Glassman said in a statement.
""I understand the inconvenience, but I believe these actions will put us in a stronger position with COVID-19 cases on the rise in Harford County and beyond,"" Glassman said. ""As the pandemic wears on, and we head into colder weather, I also want to remind folks to continue hand-washing, social distancing and wearing a mask when required. These three simple steps can save lives.""
The positivity rate is 7.36 percent in Harford County Thursday, according to the Maryland Department of Health. It is the first time since June the positivity rate has been that high, according to Harford County officials. The World Health Organization has recommended a positivity rate of 5 percent to ensure there is enough testing to detect who has the virus in a community.
Glassman said he has ordered 1,500 rapid COVID-19 tests to support a rapid response to potential cases in county government and allied agencies, including the Harford County Health Department, Harford County Public Schools, volunteer fire companies and law enforcement agencies.

By Timothy B. Wheeler
Nov 4, 2020
Tracey Waite
In a case that aimed to test the enforceability of Maryland's forest conservation law, a state court judge has thrown out a lawsuit challenging Harford County's approval of bulldozing a heavily wooded tract to build a business park.
Harford County Circuit Court Judge Diane Adkins-Tobin granted the county's and developer's motions to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and four neighbors of the proposed Abingdon business park.
The lawsuit alleged that the county hadn't followed its own forest conservation ordinance in approving the developer's plan to clear 220 acres of privately owned woods to erect several warehouses, a hotel and other commercial buildings.
Like most localities in Maryland, Harford's ordinance mirrors the state Forest Conservation Act, which allows for less than complete replacement of trees cut down but also calls for avoiding or minimizing development of important woodlands whenever possible.
The developer, Chesapeake Real Estate Group, maintained that this heavily wooded 326-acre tract in Abingdon is the only suitable site for a distribution complex, even though there were 18 vacant warehouses in the region. It pledged to preserve another 95 acres of forest on the site and will be required to plant 8 acres of new trees in mitigation for the woods it intends to clear.
In their lawsuit, opponents noted that county officials also had authorized the developer to cut down 49 of the 85 largest trees on the site, despite the law's requirement to minimize removal of large ""specimen trees.""
But in an Oct. 22 opinion, Judge Adkins-Tobin found that the county's approval of the developer's forest conservation plan was not a final decision on the project, so not subject to judicial review. The judge did say that project opponents are not prevented from suing again after the overall development plan is approved.
AJ Metcalf, spokesman for the Bay Foundation, said the nonprofit environmental group is considering an appeal of the suit's dismissal.
Tracey Waite, a Harford County climate activist and head of a coalition opposed to the business park, said neighboring residents were disappointed not to have their day in court, but they were hopeful the foundation will pursue an appeal. Meanwhile, she said, opponents were writing letters to the developer and property owner urging them to sell the land for preservation instead.
Two other pending lawsuits challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment's approval of permits allowing the developer to build across streams and wetlands on the site. One was brought by the Chesapeake Legal Alliance on behalf of the Gunpowder Riverkeeper, while another was brought by neighbors of the proposed business park. The cases have been consolidated, but a trial date has not been set.
Environmentalists contend that the state law followed by most Maryland localities isn't strong enough, in part because the state exercises little oversight over how it's enforced.
At the behest of community and environmental groups, a few counties and Baltimore city in the past year have beefed up their local forest conservation laws beyond what the state requires.

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our district is access to affordable health care. That is why we must pass Medicare for All; it will eliminate costly medical bills, deductibles, co-pays, and premiums while expanding access to include coverage for hearing, vision, dental, mental health care and long-term care.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Yes, I support Black Lives Matter.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
I think the term is incorrect for ""defund the police."" What it should be about is first recognizing that systemic racism is real in almost all systems in society.
Then, we must realize that too many duties have fallen onto police officers, spreading them too thin. It's really about reallocation of resources so that police can police, and not be social workers, doctors, etc.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
I think that there has been a failed national response from this administration. Over 215,000 Americans dead. That is a result of an inadequate and inept attempt of a response to a deadly virus. My opponent has spread misinformation about the coronavirus, and even took part in a ""Re-Open Maryland"" rally where people did not wear masks.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Unlike my opponent, I believe in equality and equity for everyone. Andy Harris has shown time and time again that he does not support equality as evidence by his votes against The Equality Act, the Deborah Sampson Act, The Violence Against Women Act, and The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act. The Human Rights Campaign named my opponent as one of the most ""anti-equality"" legislators in the United States. Mia has a long history of working and advocating for Civil Rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign, the MMAA, and the National Center for Transgender Equality.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the district?
My opponent voted against our communities in every way. He's voted against LGBT rights, women's rights, our veterans, our health care and our environment.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Investing in sustainable infrastructure and transitioning to a clean energy economy. Not only would it be better for the planet, but it would create thousands of jobs that provide a living-wage.
The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and is vital for our economy and way of life. We must protect our waters and the environment from further pollution and work to restore the bay to its natural wonder.
Expanding equality and equity to prevent discrimination of any person.
Rural communities are the backbone of America. Here in Maryland, we need to value and protect our rural environments, schools, infrastructure and economies.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My 20 years of military experience and military awards are evidence that I can handle this job. I am up to the task of serving this country.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

The passage of Medicare for All.

Why should voters trust you?

I served our country for 20 years, and I am prepared to continuing serving our country by representing Maryland's 1st district. Also, I do not accept money from corporate PACs, so I am not beholden to any big money donors. I don't have anyone to answer to except the voters themselves.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

Fiscal policy should be aimed at enhancing inclusion and power of the middle class. Taxes are necessary as long as the people know they are going to things that help them. When someone sees that they are paying money into Medicare through a tax but they pay nothing when they go to the doctor's, they know that it's going to something real.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No, I intend to serve the full term.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Join the Navy, not the Army, and learn to understand what good leadership and mentorship is when helping others."

Congressman 2011-present
The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
COVID - We need to protect the vulnerable, open up the economy as much as possible, and continue to fund Operation Warp Speed to deliver treatments and a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible, so that we can put this pandemic behind us.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
I do not support the Black Lives Matter organization - it is a socialist/communist front organization - but I do support the drive for equal treatment of everyone in front of the law. I always support peaceful protest - but never looting or violence.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
We have to increase, not decrease or de-fund the police.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
Now that the World Health Organization has said that shutdowns should not be the primary way to prevent the spread, we should re-open the economy ASAP, while protecting the vulnerable until a vaccine is produced. We do not need a nationwide mask mandate.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a conservative, and I live in the district. My opponent is supported by Hollywood liberals like Amy Schumer, and she has never lived in the First District.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Reduce taxes, cut regulation to get our economy going. Make sure that everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions, has access to affordable health care and insurance, without a mandate.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have helped important industries in the district, like farmers, seafood processors, poultry growers, watermen, and the tourism industry during my term in Congress.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

Getting our economy back to the great pre-COVID economy we had, including bringing down unemployment to historically low levels again.

Why should voters trust you?

Because I listen. I have held over 100 live and virtual town halls since I have been in office.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

We have to remember that Congress spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars, not their own - and that we are so far in debt that we are really spending our grandchildren's money at this point. We have to restrain federal spending when COVID is over.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Listen, don't speak.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I have been honored to serve as the representative of the First District, and I ask for your vote again."

Harford County relies entirely on volunteers for its fire service, and has a combination of volunteer and paid EMS providers operating in 12 volunteer companies countywide. Harford's student loan repayment program was created by County Executive Barry Glassman, a former EMT with the Level Volunteer Fire Company, to recruit and retain public safety volunteers.
The program, known as Harford's NEXT GEN Responder, is believed to be the first of its kind in Maryland.
""In addition to working paid jobs or school, our volunteer fire & EMS providers have to meet
increasingly rigorous training standards at the same time they're volunteering countless hours to
save lives in our community,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""As it gets more difficult each year to attract younger volunteers, we hope this program will strengthen our fire & EMS service and show Harford County's support for these local heroes.""
Anyone with student loans, including recent graduates and college students majoring in any field of study, is eligible for the program. To qualify, they must be a volunteer member of a Harford County VFC or ambulance company and earn 50 points in the LOSAP - or Length of Service Award Program - for qualifying service activities in the twelve months beginning on October 1 each year. Payments of up to $5,000 per year, up to a maximum of $20,000 over four years, will be made directly to the student loan issuer.

Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order allowing indoor operations to increase from 50 to 75 percent capacity, effective at 5 p.m. Monday, Sept. 21.
Buffets are still not allowed, and neither is serving patrons who are not seated.
Appropriate physical distancing and other precautions will be required to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Hogan's executive order states that retailers, religious facilities and restaurants may all operate at 75 percent capacity.
The state guidance can be tailored for each jurisdiction. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County remain under tighter restrictions than the rest of Maryland.
Increasing capacity at indoor dining establishments coincides with the state's first Maryland Restaurant Week, which is Sept. 18 through Sept. 27 and is in partnership with the Restaurant Association of Maryland and Visit Maryland.
""Restaurants in Maryland are pleased that the Governor has heard their concerns and has increased indoor dining capacity to 75 percent,"" President/CEO of the Restaurant Association of Maryland Marshall Weston said in a statement.
""The weather will soon eliminate outdoor dining as a viable option and the increase of indoor capacity will help make up for that loss,"" Weston said. ""We encourage all counties to follow the governor's executive order and not delay implementation. Restaurants will continue to serve their customers safely even with these increased capacities.""
The goal is to give businesses a boost after economic fallout from the virus, Hogan said.
""This is a perfect time to enjoy going to your favorite restaurant or trying a new place to show your support on behalf of the Maryland restaurant industry,"" according to a statement from the governor's office, which said: ""By joining together in support of this effort, Marylanders will be giving a much-needed boost to restaurants recovering from coronavirus-related restrictions while helping food service employees and their community.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Harford County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year.
Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.

ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail-in ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.

118,/maryland/belair/virtual-school-harford-county-families-lawmakers-push-back,2020-09-03T13:00:52Z,"Virtual School In Harford County: Families,...",0,0,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — Maryland State Delegate Mike Griffith is one of several parents calling upon Harford County Public Schools to offer families options other than all-virtual learning as the start of the school year approaches. Under the current plan, students in Harford County Public Schools will receive instruction remotely when the fall semester begins Tuesday, Sept. 8.
""This is an issue that impacts students from every corner of our county,"" Griffith said, speaking at a news conference he organized Thursday near Red Pump Elementary School to draw attention to the problems caused by the current path forward.
""The proposed plan will have negative effects on students with special needs, students in rural areas, students of low-income areas,"" Griffith said, ""and of course their families.""
Griffith said he worked with superintendent and governor to apply for CARES Act funding to pay for personal protective equipment for the school system ""to help get our kids in school soon."" He asked Harford County Public Schools to provide families with a choice.
""We have advocated for — at the very least — a hybrid model that allows choice for parents and teachers alike, as many students have shown in-person learning is vital,"" said Griffith.
His son, a 6-year-old who has severe autism, ""suffered significantly"" since the spring and has ""benefited significantly"" from in-person instruction at Hickory Elementary School, he said.
For students in the younger grades, in particular, there are hurdles at the outset of the semester. Due to a device shortage, kindergarten through third-grade students will not have school system-issued laptops. Their parents were told to pick up packets at their schools and have been instructed they will need to teach them, Griffith said.
Susanne Reiter of Bel Air said the ""11th-hour request"" made Aug. 28 for families to come up with their own devices left her household ""scrambling"" to purchase two overpriced Chromebooks.
She and her husband spent $1,036 — the equivalent of six part-time shifts for her husband or her entire biweekly paycheck — so her sons would have laptops, she said.
The school system offered a ""mountain of excuses,"" according to Reiter, who asked Thursday for school system leaders to provide a ""clear and reasonable explanation of its plan going forward.""
State Sen. Jason Gallian, whose daughters are in kindergarten and first grade, said his are among the 15,000 Harford County Public Schools students starting classes without Chromebooks. Gallian said he was concerned about disenfranchising lower-income students and financially burdening parents — who are taxpayers — to shoulder the cost of getting laptops themselves. Connectivity issues in parts of Harford County was also problematic, he said.
""Thousands of families in the county do not have access to high-speed internet,"" Gallian said. ""Teaching is completely ineffective if the internet connection is lost.""
Gov. Larry Hogan and State Superintendent of Schools Karen Salmon said schools should make plans to bring students back to physical classrooms and offered funding to those that moved forward in the first quarter toward in-person learning, at an Aug. 27 news conference.
""Following the governor's announcement last week, I encourage our school officials to get our children back in chool as soon and safely as possible,"" Gallian said Thursday, Sept. 3.
About 5 percent of students will attend Learning Support Centers at school buildings, according to Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson.
""HCPS' Learning Support Centers are the first step to returning students to school buildings,"" Bulson said.
Senators Bob Cassilly, Gallion and J.B. Jennings as well as Delegates Kathy Szeliga, Teresa Reilly, Susan McComas and Lauren Arikan as well as Griffith signed a letter to Harford County Public Schools Aug. 27 asking that school officials ""revisit their decision"" to hold the first semester online and to give families and teachers a choice about whether to return to the classroom.
""Many students have not opened a textbook since March, and extending that arrangement for another semester is unthinkable,"" the elected officials wrote. ""We are very concerned that the adopted plan for remote learning fails to meet even the basic educational needs of far too many students.""
They said they had heard from ""countless parents"" whose children struggled with the remote learning setup in the spring, after schools closed in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Maryland's positivity rate for the coronavirus has been under 5 percent since June 25, Hogan said, which is the recommended benchmark for reopening. In Harford County, the positivity rate was 3.97 percent as of Tuesday, Sept. 1, according to the Maryland Department of Health.
""The virus is not circulating widely in the community,"" Harford County Councilman Chad Shrodes said at Thursday's news conference. The positivity rate ""has remained under 4 percent for two consecutive weeks"" in Harford County, he said.
""If we begin the year with schools closed or at only 5 percent of their capacity, we are falsely led to assume that this is our only safe option,"" Gallion said. ""It is an uncontrolled experiement supported supported by incomplete data.""
Said Gallion: ""Returning to schools carries little risk, yet keeping them closed costs our students and our communities dearly and causes great harm, potentially a lifetime of damage for some children.""
One was the son of Amanda Bosley-Smith of Forest Hill.
It has been ""debilitating"" for her son — who has autism, is nonverbal and suffers from anxiety — to function without school for five months, she said. Since March when schools closed, he has regressed into self harming behaviors, according to his mother, who said his year-round school was not meeting.
""This abandonment is not only detrimental in the short term,"" Bosley-Smith said, but ""will affect him for the rest of his life.""
It has also negatively impacted everyone in her family, since her son requires one-to-one instruction.
""It feels like the school system is holding my son and my entire family hostage,"" Bosley-Smith said.
Thursday's news conference was not the first time families have expressed concern.
Four weeks ago, parents and students protested outside the Harford County Board of Education meeting, calling for in-person classes to resume. Days later, the school board voted to approve the virtual learning plan.
""Put our children over politics and make the right choice,"" Griffith said. ""Please stop telling us what can't be done and please work with us to tell us what we can do.""

120,/maryland/belair/bel-air-denies-annexation-request-land-near-liriodendron,2020-12-08T03:01:50Z,Bel Air Denies Annexation Request For Land Near...,3,1,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — The Bel Air Board of Town Commissioners voted Monday to deny the petition by a developer to annex a parcel of land near the Liriodendron mansion into the town of Bel Air.
The company, Liriod LLC, proposed annexation of the 1.46-acre parcel off Gordon at Catherine streets to enable the development of three homes on the property.
Commissioner Pat Richards, who proposed denying the annexation, made the suggestion after his fellow commissioners would not require the developer to limit development to two homes.
""Now is the time to restrict development,"" Richards said at Monday night's Town Hall meeting, which was held virtually. ""Be careful of the unintended consequences.""
Commissioners Kevin Bianca and Donna Kahoe also voted to deny the annexation request.
The decision to deny annexation came after two months of public input on the matter.
Nearly 20 citizens spoke out against annexation and development on the property at an Oct. 1 meeting of the planning commission, held at Calvary Baptist Church rather than the Bel Air Town Hall due to public interest and the need for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.
Afterward, the Bel Air Planning Commission recommended approving Liriod LLC's request to annex the land from Harford County into the town of Bel Air, based on three conditions: any future land use is limited to three single-family detached lots; no vehicular access will be allowed on Gordon Street; and the subdivision plan must include a landscape buffering plan.
Attorney Bradley Stover asked the town commissioners at a virtual Nov. 16 public hearing on the matter to postpone a vote since his client, Liriod LLC, wanted to research the stipulations.
""The big one is the access,"" Stover said. Going from Catherine Street instead of Gordon requires ""more development work, more stormwater management, which increases the development costs,"" he said.
""Ultimately, the applicant's preference would be that the annexation move forward without any development conditions,"" Stover said at the continuation of the November hearing, which took place virtually Monday, Dec.7. ""But we understand,"" he said, the commissioners are ""going to take into consideration whatever it is that the planning commission has recommended.""
Bel Air Mayor Amy Chmielewski and Town Commissioner Erin Hughes voted against denying the annexation.
""I'd rather have a say in what happens to that property,"" Chmielewski said after the board voted to deny the annexation request. Had the annexation request been approved, the town would be able to set stipulations for the property.
""It is not longer before the town,"" Bel Air town attorney Charles B. Keenan said after the annexation request was denied.
""It's likely they would pursue development in the county,"" Bel Air Director of Planning & Community Development Kevin Small said of Liriod LLC at November's hearing. Liriod LLC does not have access to sewer in the county and would likely ""pursue"" access, he explained, which could entail legal action.

Larry Hogan said a new type of policing would be going on this year around Thanksgiving.
To investigate reports of people violating state law, Hogan said at a news conference Monday the state was launching a unit under Maryland State Police to help enforce compliance, particularly with coronavirus regulations.
""Following the public health directives is the only way we will be able to stop this virus, keep Maryland open for business, and keep hospitals from overflowing,"" Hogan said.
Starting the night before Thanksgiving, state troopers will support local authorities in checking for compliance with state orders and educating the public about health protocols. Police will continue in these efforts through the holiday season, Hogan said.
Teams will be deployed to downtown areas like Bel Air, Towson, Salisbury, Silver Spring and Baltimore and other areas around the state ""to prevent superspreading events,"" Hogan said, through a ""compliance, education and enforcement operation.""
Bethesda, Fells Point and Allegany County will also have holiday details, according to a statement from the governor's office, which said the operation will focus on bars, restaurants, banquet halls, nightclubs and other venues that host gatherings.
""The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is often a night where kids come home from college, they go out to bars to drink and socialize,"" Hogan said at a news conference Monday. ""I cannot stress enough how reckless that behavior would be this year.""
In Maryland, a statewide face mask mandate applies to indoor public spaces, on public transportation and outside when it is not possible to maintain 6 feet of distance between people.
""We will be sending additional state police to every single county,"" Hogan said. ""Businesses and individuals who blatantly violate the public health orders and refuse to follow state law are not only willfully endangering themselves, but their family, friends and neighbors.""
Marylanders can report violations to 833-979-2266 or by emailing prevent.covid@maryland.gov, which will be overseen by the Maryland State Police COVID-19 compliance unit.
The governor commended Baltimore County for its creation of a 30-member social distancing task force. It has conducted more than 7,000 inspections, driven by complaints and the desire to be proactive, according to Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr.
""The situation is dire,"" Olszewski said, noting a 49-year-old mother who died in recent weeks from a combination of pneumonia and coronavirus. In the past month, he said, coronavirus cases more than quadrupled in Baltimore County.
""We have to take this virus seriously,"" said Olszewski, encouraging people not to gather and instead to follow public health guidance. ""Please, for the love of God, please wear your mask.""
For the latest updates on the coronavirus in Maryland, get Patch news alerts.
At 5 p.m. on Wednesday, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency will send an alert — the second case where the warning system has been used during Hogan's time as governor — that will notify those on cell phones about critical prevention measures and provide information about state and local law enforcement actions. The first time Hogan used the alert system was March 31 after issuing the stay-at-home guidance.
""If we keep on wearing our masks, washing our hands and keeping our distance,"" Hogan said, the efforts could be life-saving.
Citing what he called a ""horrific case"" of an assault on Coldstone employees in Anne Arundel County over the masking order, Hogan said of the disorderly patrons: ""They will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""
While Maryland has a statewide mask order, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County have more stringent orders around face coverings.
""There is widespread community transmission in every corner of our state,"" Hogan said, noting Maryland has reported at least 1,000 cases of the virus each day for the past 19 days. ""Especially now, it is critically important that we stay vigilant in this fight.""
More than 230 sites to test for the virus in Maryland have been set up for what Hogan called the ""rapidly increasing demand."" Visit covidtest.maryland.gov for testing locations.

Larry Hogan said at a news conference Tuesday.
""We are in a war right now, and the virus is winning,"" Hogan said. ""Now more than ever I'm pleading with the people of our state to stand together a while longer to help us battle this surging virus.""
As of Tuesday, state heath officials reported 4,186 people in Maryland have died from COVID-19.
""Twenty-six Marylanders died yesterday. That's more than one dying every hour in Maryland,"" Hogan said. ""We've lost more Marylanders to COVID-19 than we lose each year to car accidents, gun violence and the flu combined.""
Currently 1,046 people are hospitalized in the state due to COVID-19, according to authorities.
""Maryland hospitals are now reaching capacity,"" Hogan said Tuesday. ""We are very concerned that hospitals in western Maryland, for example, are already at their capacity limit, and 19 hospitals across the state are above 90 percent capacity.""
Even with the 6,000 beds provided for under the state's hospital surge plan, hospitals are at a critical point. Hogan noted Garrett and Allegany counties were particularly strained.
""To prevent the overburdening of our health care system and to stop more Marylanders from dying,"" the governor said immediate action was required.
To alleviate overcrowding, the Maryland Department of Health issued an emergency order enabling hospitals at or near capacity to transfer patients to other hospitals that can provide care.
""Currently, individual hospitals need to go critical care bed shopping — that usually takes place within their own medical system, ignoring available beds that maybe exist actually relatively close to them,"" according to Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician in chief at the R Adams Cowley University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center.
""Now a single phone call will give them access"" to facilities regardless of affiliation, Scalea said. ""This is about getting the right patient to the right place in the right amount of time to receive the correct level of medical care.""
Added Scalea: ""I'm certain that it will improve ICU bed flow as we anticipate a large number of critically ill patients.""
Several new orders will also take effect impacting hospitals, restaurants and nursing homes:
Hogan encouraged wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus and reminded Marylanders that a statewide executive order around face coverings remains in effect. It requires wearing a mask in any public indoor facility across the state and on public transportation as well as in outdoor public spaces where it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of 6 feet.
""The single best mitigation strategy that we have to fight the virus"" is wearing a mask, Hogan said. ""It's not a limitation on your right to infect other people, but it is the best way to keep you and your family members safe, to keep people out of the hospital and to save lives,"" Hogan said. ""We remain in a state of emergency.""
The developments come as the state and nation deal with a rapid increase in new COVID-19 cases.
""The sad reality is that all across America, more people are getting infected with COVID-19, more are being hospitalized, more are going into intensive care and more people are dying,"" Hogan said.
The country broke a record for coronavirus-related hospitalizations Monday with more than 73,000 Americans hospitalized, he added.
""All across the country, this virus is spiking out of control at a rate much worse than it was in the spring,"" Hogan said.
Maryland broke a record for its single-day case increase on Saturday, when 2,321 new infections were confirmed. Tuesday saw the second-highest increase, with 2,149 new cases reported.
For the latest updates on the coronavirus in Maryland, get Patch news alerts.
In response to a spike in cases, Hogan last week restricted capacity at restaurants from 75 to 50 percent. State health officials advised against indoor gatherings of more than 25 and travel to certain states.
At Tuesday's news conference, Hogan asked Marylanders to get tested for the virus if they were going to see family members for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. In particular, he called on college students planning to return home, anyone visiting an older relative and those returning from out-of-state travel to get tested. Visit covidtest.maryland.gov for testing locations.
Several jurisdictions have added further restrictions in the past week: Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Harford County, Howard County, Montgomery County and Prince George's County.

The measures come as cases have spiked in the past two weeks.
Harford County will put out drop boxes for documents and payments at 220 S. Main Street in Bel Air while county buildings are closed. Officials say Harford County government will remain open for business as county employees who are authorized to telework will do so until further notice.
Organized activities will be suspended at county parks until further notice, and some parks and recreation programming has been moved online.
County parks will remain open, and social distancing is required.
Modified service will be in place for Harford Transit.
The new measures will take effect at 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 13, in response to a spike in coronavirus cases in Harford County.
State health officials say 4,329 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Harford County as of Thursday, Nov. 12.
The coronavirus case rate is 25.82 per 100,000 people as of Thursday in Harford County, compared with 7.27 the day before Halloween, officials said.
When an area exceeds 10 new cases per 100,000, community spread has accelerated and is at dangerous levels, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. If the case rate is greater than 25, officials say community spread is out of control and may require measures to curb the infection.
""Public safety is my top priority in responding to this recent surge, and my long-term goal is to keep our economy and government services open for business,"" County Executive Barry Glassman said in a statement.
""I understand the inconvenience, but I believe these actions will put us in a stronger position with COVID-19 cases on the rise in Harford County and beyond,"" Glassman said. ""As the pandemic wears on, and we head into colder weather, I also want to remind folks to continue hand-washing, social distancing and wearing a mask when required. These three simple steps can save lives.""
The positivity rate is 7.36 percent in Harford County Thursday, according to the Maryland Department of Health. It is the first time since June the positivity rate has been that high, according to Harford County officials. The World Health Organization has recommended a positivity rate of 5 percent to ensure there is enough testing to detect who has the virus in a community.
Glassman said he has ordered 1,500 rapid COVID-19 tests to support a rapid response to potential cases in county government and allied agencies, including the Harford County Health Department, Harford County Public Schools, volunteer fire companies and law enforcement agencies.

By Timothy B. Wheeler
Nov 4, 2020
Tracey Waite
In a case that aimed to test the enforceability of Maryland's forest conservation law, a state court judge has thrown out a lawsuit challenging Harford County's approval of bulldozing a heavily wooded tract to build a business park.
Harford County Circuit Court Judge Diane Adkins-Tobin granted the county's and developer's motions to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and four neighbors of the proposed Abingdon business park.
The lawsuit alleged that the county hadn't followed its own forest conservation ordinance in approving the developer's plan to clear 220 acres of privately owned woods to erect several warehouses, a hotel and other commercial buildings.
Like most localities in Maryland, Harford's ordinance mirrors the state Forest Conservation Act, which allows for less than complete replacement of trees cut down but also calls for avoiding or minimizing development of important woodlands whenever possible.
The developer, Chesapeake Real Estate Group, maintained that this heavily wooded 326-acre tract in Abingdon is the only suitable site for a distribution complex, even though there were 18 vacant warehouses in the region. It pledged to preserve another 95 acres of forest on the site and will be required to plant 8 acres of new trees in mitigation for the woods it intends to clear.
In their lawsuit, opponents noted that county officials also had authorized the developer to cut down 49 of the 85 largest trees on the site, despite the law's requirement to minimize removal of large ""specimen trees.""
But in an Oct. 22 opinion, Judge Adkins-Tobin found that the county's approval of the developer's forest conservation plan was not a final decision on the project, so not subject to judicial review. The judge did say that project opponents are not prevented from suing again after the overall development plan is approved.
AJ Metcalf, spokesman for the Bay Foundation, said the nonprofit environmental group is considering an appeal of the suit's dismissal.
Tracey Waite, a Harford County climate activist and head of a coalition opposed to the business park, said neighboring residents were disappointed not to have their day in court, but they were hopeful the foundation will pursue an appeal. Meanwhile, she said, opponents were writing letters to the developer and property owner urging them to sell the land for preservation instead.
Two other pending lawsuits challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment's approval of permits allowing the developer to build across streams and wetlands on the site. One was brought by the Chesapeake Legal Alliance on behalf of the Gunpowder Riverkeeper, while another was brought by neighbors of the proposed business park. The cases have been consolidated, but a trial date has not been set.
Environmentalists contend that the state law followed by most Maryland localities isn't strong enough, in part because the state exercises little oversight over how it's enforced.
At the behest of community and environmental groups, a few counties and Baltimore city in the past year have beefed up their local forest conservation laws beyond what the state requires.

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our district is access to affordable health care. That is why we must pass Medicare for All; it will eliminate costly medical bills, deductibles, co-pays, and premiums while expanding access to include coverage for hearing, vision, dental, mental health care and long-term care.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Yes, I support Black Lives Matter.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
I think the term is incorrect for ""defund the police."" What it should be about is first recognizing that systemic racism is real in almost all systems in society.
Then, we must realize that too many duties have fallen onto police officers, spreading them too thin. It's really about reallocation of resources so that police can police, and not be social workers, doctors, etc.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
I think that there has been a failed national response from this administration. Over 215,000 Americans dead. That is a result of an inadequate and inept attempt of a response to a deadly virus. My opponent has spread misinformation about the coronavirus, and even took part in a ""Re-Open Maryland"" rally where people did not wear masks.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Unlike my opponent, I believe in equality and equity for everyone. Andy Harris has shown time and time again that he does not support equality as evidence by his votes against The Equality Act, the Deborah Sampson Act, The Violence Against Women Act, and The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act. The Human Rights Campaign named my opponent as one of the most ""anti-equality"" legislators in the United States. Mia has a long history of working and advocating for Civil Rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign, the MMAA, and the National Center for Transgender Equality.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the district?
My opponent voted against our communities in every way. He's voted against LGBT rights, women's rights, our veterans, our health care and our environment.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Investing in sustainable infrastructure and transitioning to a clean energy economy. Not only would it be better for the planet, but it would create thousands of jobs that provide a living-wage.
The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and is vital for our economy and way of life. We must protect our waters and the environment from further pollution and work to restore the bay to its natural wonder.
Expanding equality and equity to prevent discrimination of any person.
Rural communities are the backbone of America. Here in Maryland, we need to value and protect our rural environments, schools, infrastructure and economies.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My 20 years of military experience and military awards are evidence that I can handle this job. I am up to the task of serving this country.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

The passage of Medicare for All.

Why should voters trust you?

I served our country for 20 years, and I am prepared to continuing serving our country by representing Maryland's 1st district. Also, I do not accept money from corporate PACs, so I am not beholden to any big money donors. I don't have anyone to answer to except the voters themselves.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

Fiscal policy should be aimed at enhancing inclusion and power of the middle class. Taxes are necessary as long as the people know they are going to things that help them. When someone sees that they are paying money into Medicare through a tax but they pay nothing when they go to the doctor's, they know that it's going to something real.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No, I intend to serve the full term.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Join the Navy, not the Army, and learn to understand what good leadership and mentorship is when helping others."

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
COVID - We need to protect the vulnerable, open up the economy as much as possible, and continue to fund Operation Warp Speed to deliver treatments and a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible, so that we can put this pandemic behind us.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
I do not support the Black Lives Matter organization - it is a socialist/communist front organization - but I do support the drive for equal treatment of everyone in front of the law. I always support peaceful protest - but never looting or violence.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
We have to increase, not decrease or de-fund the police.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
Now that the World Health Organization has said that shutdowns should not be the primary way to prevent the spread, we should re-open the economy ASAP, while protecting the vulnerable until a vaccine is produced. We do not need a nationwide mask mandate.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a conservative, and I live in the district. My opponent is supported by Hollywood liberals like Amy Schumer, and she has never lived in the First District.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Reduce taxes, cut regulation to get our economy going. Make sure that everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions, has access to affordable health care and insurance, without a mandate.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have helped important industries in the district, like farmers, seafood processors, poultry growers, watermen, and the tourism industry during my term in Congress.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

Getting our economy back to the great pre-COVID economy we had, including bringing down unemployment to historically low levels again.

Why should voters trust you?

Because I listen. I have held over 100 live and virtual town halls since I have been in office.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

We have to remember that Congress spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars, not their own - and that we are so far in debt that we are really spending our grandchildren's money at this point. We have to restrain federal spending when COVID is over.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Listen, don't speak.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I have been honored to serve as the representative of the First District, and I ask for your vote again."

Harford County relies entirely on volunteers for its fire service, and has a combination of volunteer and paid EMS providers operating in 12 volunteer companies countywide. Harford's student loan repayment program was created by County Executive Barry Glassman, a former EMT with the Level Volunteer Fire Company, to recruit and retain public safety volunteers.
The program, known as Harford's NEXT GEN Responder, is believed to be the first of its kind in Maryland.
""In addition to working paid jobs or school, our volunteer fire & EMS providers have to meet
increasingly rigorous training standards at the same time they're volunteering countless hours to
save lives in our community,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""As it gets more difficult each year to attract younger volunteers, we hope this program will strengthen our fire & EMS service and show Harford County's support for these local heroes.""
Anyone with student loans, including recent graduates and college students majoring in any field of study, is eligible for the program. To qualify, they must be a volunteer member of a Harford County VFC or ambulance company and earn 50 points in the LOSAP - or Length of Service Award Program - for qualifying service activities in the twelve months beginning on October 1 each year. Payments of up to $5,000 per year, up to a maximum of $20,000 over four years, will be made directly to the student loan issuer.

Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order allowing indoor operations to increase from 50 to 75 percent capacity, effective at 5 p.m. Monday, Sept. 21.
Buffets are still not allowed, and neither is serving patrons who are not seated.
Appropriate physical distancing and other precautions will be required to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Hogan's executive order states that retailers, religious facilities and restaurants may all operate at 75 percent capacity.
The state guidance can be tailored for each jurisdiction. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County remain under tighter restrictions than the rest of Maryland.
Increasing capacity at indoor dining establishments coincides with the state's first Maryland Restaurant Week, which is Sept. 18 through Sept. 27 and is in partnership with the Restaurant Association of Maryland and Visit Maryland.
""Restaurants in Maryland are pleased that the Governor has heard their concerns and has increased indoor dining capacity to 75 percent,"" President/CEO of the Restaurant Association of Maryland Marshall Weston said in a statement.
""The weather will soon eliminate outdoor dining as a viable option and the increase of indoor capacity will help make up for that loss,"" Weston said. ""We encourage all counties to follow the governor's executive order and not delay implementation. Restaurants will continue to serve their customers safely even with these increased capacities.""
The goal is to give businesses a boost after economic fallout from the virus, Hogan said.
""This is a perfect time to enjoy going to your favorite restaurant or trying a new place to show your support on behalf of the Maryland restaurant industry,"" according to a statement from the governor's office, which said: ""By joining together in support of this effort, Marylanders will be giving a much-needed boost to restaurants recovering from coronavirus-related restrictions while helping food service employees and their community.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Harford County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year.
Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in 2016, working with ProPublica to bring you information about vandalism at one polling place in Baltimore and a missing ballot page at another, broken scanners at the polls in New York, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail-in ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences.

140,/maryland/belair/bel-air-denies-annexation-request-land-near-liriodendron,2020-12-08T03:01:50Z,Bel Air Denies Annexation Request For Land Near...,3,1,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"BEL AIR, MD — The Bel Air Board of Town Commissioners voted Monday to deny the petition by a developer to annex a parcel of land near the Liriodendron mansion into the town of Bel Air.
The company, Liriod LLC, proposed annexation of the 1.46-acre parcel off Gordon at Catherine streets to enable the development of three homes on the property.
Commissioner Pat Richards, who proposed denying the annexation, made the suggestion after his fellow commissioners would not require the developer to limit development to two homes.
""Now is the time to restrict development,"" Richards said at Monday night's Town Hall meeting, which was held virtually. ""Be careful of the unintended consequences.""
Commissioners Kevin Bianca and Donna Kahoe also voted to deny the annexation request.
The decision to deny annexation came after two months of public input on the matter.
Nearly 20 citizens spoke out against annexation and development on the property at an Oct. 1 meeting of the planning commission, held at Calvary Baptist Church rather than the Bel Air Town Hall due to public interest and the need for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.
Afterward, the Bel Air Planning Commission recommended approving Liriod LLC's request to annex the land from Harford County into the town of Bel Air, based on three conditions: any future land use is limited to three single-family detached lots; no vehicular access will be allowed on Gordon Street; and the subdivision plan must include a landscape buffering plan.
Attorney Bradley Stover asked the town commissioners at a virtual Nov. 16 public hearing on the matter to postpone a vote since his client, Liriod LLC, wanted to research the stipulations.
""The big one is the access,"" Stover said. Going from Catherine Street instead of Gordon requires ""more development work, more stormwater management, which increases the development costs,"" he said.
""Ultimately, the applicant's preference would be that the annexation move forward without any development conditions,"" Stover said at the continuation of the November hearing, which took place virtually Monday, Dec.7. ""But we understand,"" he said, the commissioners are ""going to take into consideration whatever it is that the planning commission has recommended.""
Bel Air Mayor Amy Chmielewski and Town Commissioner Erin Hughes voted against denying the annexation.
""I'd rather have a say in what happens to that property,"" Chmielewski said after the board voted to deny the annexation request. Had the annexation request been approved, the town would be able to set stipulations for the property.
""It is not longer before the town,"" Bel Air town attorney Charles B. Keenan said after the annexation request was denied.
""It's likely they would pursue development in the county,"" Bel Air Director of Planning & Community Development Kevin Small said of Liriod LLC at November's hearing. Liriod LLC does not have access to sewer in the county and would likely ""pursue"" access, he explained, which could entail legal action.

141,/maryland/belair/covid-policing-statewide-alert,2020-11-23T21:38:37Z,New COVID Policing Unit To Launch In Maryland...,1,134,Elizabeth Janney,Patch Staff,"ANNAPOLIS, MD — On top of drunk driving patrols, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said a new type of policing would be going on this year around Thanksgiving.
To investigate reports of people violating state law, Hogan said at a news conference Monday the state was launching a unit under Maryland State Police to help enforce compliance, particularly with coronavirus regulations.
""Following the public health directives is the only way we will be able to stop this virus, keep Maryland open for business, and keep hospitals from overflowing,"" Hogan said.
Starting the night before Thanksgiving, state troopers will support local authorities in checking for compliance with state orders and educating the public about health protocols. Police will continue in these efforts through the holiday season, Hogan said.
Teams will be deployed to downtown areas like Bel Air, Towson, Salisbury, Silver Spring and Baltimore and other areas around the state ""to prevent superspreading events,"" Hogan said, through a ""compliance, education and enforcement operation.""
Bethesda, Fells Point and Allegany County will also have holiday details, according to a statement from the governor's office, which said the operation will focus on bars, restaurants, banquet halls, nightclubs and other venues that host gatherings.
""The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is often a night where kids come home from college, they go out to bars to drink and socialize,"" Hogan said at a news conference Monday. ""I cannot stress enough how reckless that behavior would be this year.""
In Maryland, a statewide face mask mandate applies to indoor public spaces, on public transportation and outside when it is not possible to maintain 6 feet of distance between people.
""We will be sending additional state police to every single county,"" Hogan said. ""Businesses and individuals who blatantly violate the public health orders and refuse to follow state law are not only willfully endangering themselves, but their family, friends and neighbors.""
Marylanders can report violations to 833-979-2266 or by emailing prevent.covid@maryland.gov, which will be overseen by the Maryland State Police COVID-19 compliance unit.
The governor commended Baltimore County for its creation of a 30-member social distancing task force. It has conducted more than 7,000 inspections, driven by complaints and the desire to be proactive, according to Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr.
""The situation is dire,"" Olszewski said, noting a 49-year-old mother who died in recent weeks from a combination of pneumonia and coronavirus. In the past month, he said, coronavirus cases more than quadrupled in Baltimore County.
""We have to take this virus seriously,"" said Olszewski, encouraging people not to gather and instead to follow public health guidance. ""Please, for the love of God, please wear your mask.""
For the latest updates on the coronavirus in Maryland, get Patch news alerts.
At 5 p.m. on Wednesday, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency will send an alert — the second case where the warning system has been used during Hogan's time as governor — that will notify those on cell phones about critical prevention measures and provide information about state and local law enforcement actions. The first time Hogan used the alert system was March 31 after issuing the stay-at-home guidance.
""If we keep on wearing our masks, washing our hands and keeping our distance,"" Hogan said, the efforts could be life-saving.
Citing what he called a ""horrific case"" of an assault on Coldstone employees in Anne Arundel County over the masking order, Hogan said of the disorderly patrons: ""They will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""
While Maryland has a statewide mask order, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County have more stringent orders around face coverings.
""There is widespread community transmission in every corner of our state,"" Hogan said, noting Maryland has reported at least 1,000 cases of the virus each day for the past 19 days. ""Especially now, it is critically important that we stay vigilant in this fight.""
More than 230 sites to test for the virus in Maryland have been set up for what Hogan called the ""rapidly increasing demand."" Visit covidtest.maryland.gov for testing locations.

Larry Hogan said at a news conference Tuesday.
""We are in a war right now, and the virus is winning,"" Hogan said. ""Now more than ever I'm pleading with the people of our state to stand together a while longer to help us battle this surging virus.""
As of Tuesday, state heath officials reported 4,186 people in Maryland have died from COVID-19.
""Twenty-six Marylanders died yesterday. That's more than one dying every hour in Maryland,"" Hogan said. ""We've lost more Marylanders to COVID-19 than we lose each year to car accidents, gun violence and the flu combined.""
Currently 1,046 people are hospitalized in the state due to COVID-19, according to authorities.
""Maryland hospitals are now reaching capacity,"" Hogan said Tuesday. ""We are very concerned that hospitals in western Maryland, for example, are already at their capacity limit, and 19 hospitals across the state are above 90 percent capacity.""
Even with the 6,000 beds provided for under the state's hospital surge plan, hospitals are at a critical point. Hogan noted Garrett and Allegany counties were particularly strained.
""To prevent the overburdening of our health care system and to stop more Marylanders from dying,"" the governor said immediate action was required.
To alleviate overcrowding, the Maryland Department of Health issued an emergency order enabling hospitals at or near capacity to transfer patients to other hospitals that can provide care.
""Currently, individual hospitals need to go critical care bed shopping — that usually takes place within their own medical system, ignoring available beds that maybe exist actually relatively close to them,"" according to Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician in chief at the R Adams Cowley University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center.
""Now a single phone call will give them access"" to facilities regardless of affiliation, Scalea said. ""This is about getting the right patient to the right place in the right amount of time to receive the correct level of medical care.""
Added Scalea: ""I'm certain that it will improve ICU bed flow as we anticipate a large number of critically ill patients.""
Several new orders will also take effect impacting hospitals, restaurants and nursing homes:
Hogan encouraged wearing masks to prevent the spread of the virus and reminded Marylanders that a statewide executive order around face coverings remains in effect. It requires wearing a mask in any public indoor facility across the state and on public transportation as well as in outdoor public spaces where it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of 6 feet.
""The single best mitigation strategy that we have to fight the virus"" is wearing a mask, Hogan said. ""It's not a limitation on your right to infect other people, but it is the best way to keep you and your family members safe, to keep people out of the hospital and to save lives,"" Hogan said. ""We remain in a state of emergency.""
The developments come as the state and nation deal with a rapid increase in new COVID-19 cases.
""The sad reality is that all across America, more people are getting infected with COVID-19, more are being hospitalized, more are going into intensive care and more people are dying,"" Hogan said.
The country broke a record for coronavirus-related hospitalizations Monday with more than 73,000 Americans hospitalized, he added.
""All across the country, this virus is spiking out of control at a rate much worse than it was in the spring,"" Hogan said.
Maryland broke a record for its single-day case increase on Saturday, when 2,321 new infections were confirmed. Tuesday saw the second-highest increase, with 2,149 new cases reported.
For the latest updates on the coronavirus in Maryland, get Patch news alerts.
In response to a spike in cases, Hogan last week restricted capacity at restaurants from 75 to 50 percent. State health officials advised against indoor gatherings of more than 25 and travel to certain states.
At Tuesday's news conference, Hogan asked Marylanders to get tested for the virus if they were going to see family members for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. In particular, he called on college students planning to return home, anyone visiting an older relative and those returning from out-of-state travel to get tested. Visit covidtest.maryland.gov for testing locations.
Several jurisdictions have added further restrictions in the past week: Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Harford County, Howard County, Montgomery County and Prince George's County.

The measures come as cases have spiked in the past two weeks.
Harford County will put out drop boxes for documents and payments at 220 S. Main Street in Bel Air while county buildings are closed. Officials say Harford County government will remain open for business as county employees who are authorized to telework will do so until further notice.
Organized activities will be suspended at county parks until further notice, and some parks and recreation programming has been moved online.
County parks will remain open, and social distancing is required.
Modified service will be in place for Harford Transit.
The new measures will take effect at 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 13, in response to a spike in coronavirus cases in Harford County.
State health officials say 4,329 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Harford County as of Thursday, Nov. 12.
The coronavirus case rate is 25.82 per 100,000 people as of Thursday in Harford County, compared with 7.27 the day before Halloween, officials said.
When an area exceeds 10 new cases per 100,000, community spread has accelerated and is at dangerous levels, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute. If the case rate is greater than 25, officials say community spread is out of control and may require measures to curb the infection.
""Public safety is my top priority in responding to this recent surge, and my long-term goal is to keep our economy and government services open for business,"" County Executive Barry Glassman said in a statement.
""I understand the inconvenience, but I believe these actions will put us in a stronger position with COVID-19 cases on the rise in Harford County and beyond,"" Glassman said. ""As the pandemic wears on, and we head into colder weather, I also want to remind folks to continue hand-washing, social distancing and wearing a mask when required. These three simple steps can save lives.""
The positivity rate is 7.36 percent in Harford County Thursday, according to the Maryland Department of Health. It is the first time since June the positivity rate has been that high, according to Harford County officials. The World Health Organization has recommended a positivity rate of 5 percent to ensure there is enough testing to detect who has the virus in a community.
Glassman said he has ordered 1,500 rapid COVID-19 tests to support a rapid response to potential cases in county government and allied agencies, including the Harford County Health Department, Harford County Public Schools, volunteer fire companies and law enforcement agencies.

By Timothy B. Wheeler
Nov 4, 2020
Tracey Waite
In a case that aimed to test the enforceability of Maryland's forest conservation law, a state court judge has thrown out a lawsuit challenging Harford County's approval of bulldozing a heavily wooded tract to build a business park.
Harford County Circuit Court Judge Diane Adkins-Tobin granted the county's and developer's motions to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and four neighbors of the proposed Abingdon business park.
The lawsuit alleged that the county hadn't followed its own forest conservation ordinance in approving the developer's plan to clear 220 acres of privately owned woods to erect several warehouses, a hotel and other commercial buildings.
Like most localities in Maryland, Harford's ordinance mirrors the state Forest Conservation Act, which allows for less than complete replacement of trees cut down but also calls for avoiding or minimizing development of important woodlands whenever possible.
The developer, Chesapeake Real Estate Group, maintained that this heavily wooded 326-acre tract in Abingdon is the only suitable site for a distribution complex, even though there were 18 vacant warehouses in the region. It pledged to preserve another 95 acres of forest on the site and will be required to plant 8 acres of new trees in mitigation for the woods it intends to clear.
In their lawsuit, opponents noted that county officials also had authorized the developer to cut down 49 of the 85 largest trees on the site, despite the law's requirement to minimize removal of large ""specimen trees.""
But in an Oct. 22 opinion, Judge Adkins-Tobin found that the county's approval of the developer's forest conservation plan was not a final decision on the project, so not subject to judicial review. The judge did say that project opponents are not prevented from suing again after the overall development plan is approved.
AJ Metcalf, spokesman for the Bay Foundation, said the nonprofit environmental group is considering an appeal of the suit's dismissal.
Tracey Waite, a Harford County climate activist and head of a coalition opposed to the business park, said neighboring residents were disappointed not to have their day in court, but they were hopeful the foundation will pursue an appeal. Meanwhile, she said, opponents were writing letters to the developer and property owner urging them to sell the land for preservation instead.
Two other pending lawsuits challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment's approval of permits allowing the developer to build across streams and wetlands on the site. One was brought by the Chesapeake Legal Alliance on behalf of the Gunpowder Riverkeeper, while another was brought by neighbors of the proposed business park. The cases have been consolidated, but a trial date has not been set.
Environmentalists contend that the state law followed by most Maryland localities isn't strong enough, in part because the state exercises little oversight over how it's enforced.
At the behest of community and environmental groups, a few counties and Baltimore city in the past year have beefed up their local forest conservation laws beyond what the state requires.

The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
The single most pressing issue facing our district is access to affordable health care. That is why we must pass Medicare for All; it will eliminate costly medical bills, deductibles, co-pays, and premiums while expanding access to include coverage for hearing, vision, dental, mental health care and long-term care.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
Yes, I support Black Lives Matter.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
I think the term is incorrect for ""defund the police."" What it should be about is first recognizing that systemic racism is real in almost all systems in society.
Then, we must realize that too many duties have fallen onto police officers, spreading them too thin. It's really about reallocation of resources so that police can police, and not be social workers, doctors, etc.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
I think that there has been a failed national response from this administration. Over 215,000 Americans dead. That is a result of an inadequate and inept attempt of a response to a deadly virus. My opponent has spread misinformation about the coronavirus, and even took part in a ""Re-Open Maryland"" rally where people did not wear masks.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
Unlike my opponent, I believe in equality and equity for everyone. Andy Harris has shown time and time again that he does not support equality as evidence by his votes against The Equality Act, the Deborah Sampson Act, The Violence Against Women Act, and The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act. The Human Rights Campaign named my opponent as one of the most ""anti-equality"" legislators in the United States. Mia has a long history of working and advocating for Civil Rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign, the MMAA, and the National Center for Transgender Equality.
If you are a challenger, in what way has the current board or officeholder failed the district?
My opponent voted against our communities in every way. He's voted against LGBT rights, women's rights, our veterans, our health care and our environment.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Investing in sustainable infrastructure and transitioning to a clean energy economy. Not only would it be better for the planet, but it would create thousands of jobs that provide a living-wage.
The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and is vital for our economy and way of life. We must protect our waters and the environment from further pollution and work to restore the bay to its natural wonder.
Expanding equality and equity to prevent discrimination of any person.
Rural communities are the backbone of America. Here in Maryland, we need to value and protect our rural environments, schools, infrastructure and economies.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
My 20 years of military experience and military awards are evidence that I can handle this job. I am up to the task of serving this country.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

The passage of Medicare for All.

Why should voters trust you?

I served our country for 20 years, and I am prepared to continuing serving our country by representing Maryland's 1st district. Also, I do not accept money from corporate PACs, so I am not beholden to any big money donors. I don't have anyone to answer to except the voters themselves.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

Fiscal policy should be aimed at enhancing inclusion and power of the middle class. Taxes are necessary as long as the people know they are going to things that help them. When someone sees that they are paying money into Medicare through a tax but they pay nothing when they go to the doctor's, they know that it's going to something real.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No, I intend to serve the full term.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Join the Navy, not the Army, and learn to understand what good leadership and mentorship is when helping others."

Congressman 2011-present
The single most pressing issue facing our (board, district, etc.) is _______, and this is what I intend to do about it.
COVID - We need to protect the vulnerable, open up the economy as much as possible, and continue to fund Operation Warp Speed to deliver treatments and a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible, so that we can put this pandemic behind us.
Do you support Black Lives Matter and what are your thoughts on the demonstrations held since the death of George Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake?
I do not support the Black Lives Matter organization - it is a socialist/communist front organization - but I do support the drive for equal treatment of everyone in front of the law. I always support peaceful protest - but never looting or violence.
What are your thoughts on the campaign to ""defund"" the police?
We have to increase, not decrease or de-fund the police.
What are your thoughts on the state and national response to the coronavirus pandemic? Do you favor such measures as limiting operation of non-essential businesses or restricting indoor/outdoor dining? And do you favor a nationwide mask mandate?
Now that the World Health Organization has said that shutdowns should not be the primary way to prevent the spread, we should re-open the economy ASAP, while protecting the vulnerable until a vaccine is produced. We do not need a nationwide mask mandate.
What are the critical differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post?
I am a conservative, and I live in the district. My opponent is supported by Hollywood liberals like Amy Schumer, and she has never lived in the First District.
Describe the other issues that define your campaign platform.
Reduce taxes, cut regulation to get our economy going. Make sure that everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions, has access to affordable health care and insurance, without a mandate.
What accomplishments in your past would you cite as evidence you can handle this job?
I have helped important industries in the district, like farmers, seafood processors, poultry growers, watermen, and the tourism industry during my term in Congress.
If you win this position, what accomplishment would make your term in office as a success?

Getting our economy back to the great pre-COVID economy we had, including bringing down unemployment to historically low levels again.

Why should voters trust you?

Because I listen. I have held over 100 live and virtual town halls since I have been in office.

What are your views on fiscal policy, government spending and the use of taxpayer dollars in the office you are seeking?

We have to remember that Congress spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars, not their own - and that we are so far in debt that we are really spending our grandchildren's money at this point. We have to restrain federal spending when COVID is over.

Is there any reason you would not serve your full term of office, other than those of health or family?

No.
The best advice ever shared with me was:
Listen, don't speak.
What else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions?
I have been honored to serve as the representative of the First District, and I ask for your vote again."

Harford County relies entirely on volunteers for its fire service, and has a combination of volunteer and paid EMS providers operating in 12 volunteer companies countywide. Harford's student loan repayment program was created by County Executive Barry Glassman, a former EMT with the Level Volunteer Fire Company, to recruit and retain public safety volunteers.
The program, known as Harford's NEXT GEN Responder, is believed to be the first of its kind in Maryland.
""In addition to working paid jobs or school, our volunteer fire & EMS providers have to meet
increasingly rigorous training standards at the same time they're volunteering countless hours to
save lives in our community,"" County Executive Glassman said. ""As it gets more difficult each year to attract younger volunteers, we hope this program will strengthen our fire & EMS service and show Harford County's support for these local heroes.""
Anyone with student loans, including recent graduates and college students majoring in any field of study, is eligible for the program. To qualify, they must be a volunteer member of a Harford County VFC or ambulance company and earn 50 points in the LOSAP - or Length of Service Award Program - for qualifying service activities in the twelve months beginning on October 1 each year. Payments of up to $5,000 per year, up to a maximum of $20,000 over four years, will be made directly to the student loan issuer.

Gov. Larry Hogan signed an executive order allowing indoor operations to increase from 50 to 75 percent capacity, effective at 5 p.m. Monday, Sept. 21.
Buffets are still not allowed, and neither is serving patrons who are not seated.
Appropriate physical distancing and other precautions will be required to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Hogan's executive order states that retailers, religious facilities and restaurants may all operate at 75 percent capacity.
The state guidance can be tailored for each jurisdiction. Anne Arundel County, Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County remain under tighter restrictions than the rest of Maryland.
Increasing capacity at indoor dining establishments coincides with the state's first Maryland Restaurant Week, which is Sept. 18 through Sept. 27 and is in partnership with the Restaurant Association of Maryland and Visit Maryland.
""Restaurants in Maryland are pleased that the Governor has heard their concerns and has increased indoor dining capacity to 75 percent,"" President/CEO of the Restaurant Association of Maryland Marshall Weston said in a statement.
""The weather will soon eliminate outdoor dining as a viable option and the increase of indoor capacity will help make up for that loss,"" Weston said. ""We encourage all counties to follow the governor's executive order and not delay implementation. Restaurants will continue to serve their customers safely even with these increased capacities.""
The goal is to give businesses a boost after economic fallout from the virus, Hogan said.
""This is a perfect time to enjoy going to your favorite restaurant or trying a new place to show your support on behalf of the Maryland restaurant industry,"" according to a statement from the governor's office, which said: ""By joining together in support of this effort, Marylanders will be giving a much-needed boost to restaurants recovering from coronavirus-related restrictions while helping food service employees and their community.""

The coronavirus pandemic is increasing interest in mail-in balloting — something about 100 million people are eligible to do without giving an ""excuse"" or reason.
Because of the surge in absentee balloting in Harford County and elsewhere, the nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica has launched its Electionland tip lines early this year.
Patch has joined the coalition of newsrooms participating in the Electionland project to discover problems that prevent eligible voters from accessing or casting their ballots during or ahead of the Nov. 3 general election.
Patch participated in the Electionland project in 2016, working with ProPublica to bring you information about vandalism at one polling place in Baltimore and a missing ballot page at another, broken scanners at the polls in New York, an election day shooting in Azusa, California, and more.
ProPublica wants to hear about any problems that may prevent people from voting — for example, mail-in ballot delivery problems, voting location changes, long lines, registration problems, purged voter rolls, broken machines and voter intimidation.
Our journalists and those at other newsrooms taking part in the Electionland project will do what we can to document and verify what readers tell us about voting and Election Day experiences. One of the most important parts of the Electionland project is to hear directly from voters. There are several ways to do that:"
